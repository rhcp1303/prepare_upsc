Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test factual recall, analysis, and understanding of government schemes and policies.  Remember, the questions are designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors to test your knowledge thoroughly.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Sandhan personalized test series feature:**

1. It offers access to over 15,000 high-quality questions.
2. It allows aspirants to create custom tests based on their chosen subjects and topics.
3.  It provides a student dashboard to track performance in specific subjects.
4. It exclusively uses UPSC previous year questions for practice.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Sandhan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the features of Sandhan as described in the text.  Sandhan provides access to a vast question bank (over 15,000), allows for personalized test creation, and offers a dashboard for performance tracking. However, statement 4 is incorrect; Sandhan allows the selection of either VisionIAS questions *or* UPSC Previous Year Questions, not exclusively the latter.  The inclusion of statement 4 as a distractor tests the candidate's ability to discern nuanced differences in the description of the program.


**2. Consider the following government schemes:**

1. Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-KISAN)
2. Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)
3. National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP)
4.  Assistance to Medical Device Clusters for Common Facilities (AMD-CF) Scheme

How many of these schemes fall under the purview of the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  PM-KISAN, PMFBY, and NMEO-OP are all agricultural schemes listed under the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare in the provided document. The AMD-CF scheme, however, falls under the Ministry of Chemicals & Fertilizers.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific ministerial responsibilities and the ability to correctly associate schemes with the appropriate ministries.  The inclusion of a seemingly related scheme from a different ministry creates a strong distractor.


**3. Consider the following features of the Holistic Progress Card (HPC):**

1.  It assesses children through project-based learning.
2. It incorporates peer assessment of children's progress.
3. It focuses solely on cognitive development.
4. It provides a 360-degree report of student progress across multiple domains.

How many of these features correctly describe the HPC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The HPC, as described, uses project-based learning (1) and incorporates peer assessment (2)  and provides a multi-dimensional report (4) encompassing cognitive, affective, socio-emotional, and psychomotor domains.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the HPC is explicitly stated to cover multiple developmental domains, not just cognitive development. The deliberate inclusion of a partially true but ultimately false statement increases the question's difficulty and challenges the candidate's ability to analyze and evaluate the information provided.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Integrated National School Education Treasury (INSET):**

1. It aims to create a seamless information network for all school-related data.
2. It receives funds from the Secondary and Higher Education Cess.
3. It is primarily managed by the Ministry of Rural Development.
4. It exclusively focuses on primary school education data.

How many of the above statements correctly describe INSET?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** INSET aims to integrate school information (1), and it receives funds from the Madhyamik and Uchchtar Shiksha Kosh (MUSK), which is funded by the Secondary and Higher Education Cess (2). Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect; the text doesn't state that the Ministry of Rural Development manages INSET, and INSET's scope covers data from all levels of schooling, not just primary.  This question tests the candidate's ability to accurately remember details about a specific government initiative and differentiate it from other, potentially similar-sounding programs.  The inclusion of plausible distractors related to funding sources and administrative responsibility increases the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following about the  Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference (SFTLC):**

1. It was hosted by the Indian government.
2. It aims to mobilize US$1 billion for tiger conservation by 2034.
3. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) is a member organization of the Tiger Conservation Coalition.
4. It focuses solely on financial strategies, excluding global partnerships.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The SFTLC aimed to secure US$1 billion by 2034 and WWF is listed as a member organization.  Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect; the conference was hosted by the Bhutan government, and it explicitly mentions promoting global partnerships as a key objective.  This question tests knowledge of a specific international conservation initiative, requiring precise recall of organizational details and geographical location, and the ability to identify misleading information within the statement.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  Abortion Law in India:**

1. Abortion is legal under all circumstances.
2. The MTP Act, 1971, was amended in 2021 to improve access to abortion services.
3. Sections 88 to 92 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, address causing miscarriage.
4. The Supreme Court always grants requests for abortion termination beyond 20 weeks.


How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The MTP Act was amended to enhance access, and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita includes provisions related to miscarriage. Statement 1 is incorrect; abortion is not legal under all circumstances, but only under specific conditions outlined in the MTP Act. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court does not automatically grant abortion requests beyond 20 weeks; it considers the specific circumstances of each case. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework surrounding abortion in India and the nuances of judicial interpretations.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true but ultimately inaccurate serves as a significant distractor.


**7. Consider the following about the  National Achievement Survey (NAS):**

1.  It provides individual student scores.
2. It assesses students in Classes 3, 5, 8, and 10.
3. It is led by the NAS Cell, NCERT, and CBSE.
4. It exclusively focuses on private schools.


How many of the statements are correct?

(a) One
(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) Four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. NAS assesses the mentioned classes and is led by the specified organizations.  Statement 1 is incorrect; NAS does not provide individual student scores but rather system-level analysis. Statement 4 is also incorrect; NAS includes government, aided, and private schools.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the scope and methodology of a national educational assessment program, requiring the recall of specific details about its implementation and data analysis.  The inclusion of distractors related to data reporting and institutional involvement increases the difficulty.


**8. Consider the following regarding the  "Electric Mobility Promotion Scheme (EMPS)":**

1. It falls under the Ministry of Heavy Industries.
2. It exclusively promotes the use of electric two-wheelers.
3. It involves financial incentives for electric vehicle adoption.
4. It is primarily focused on rural areas.

How many of the statements correctly describe EMPS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. EMPS is under the Ministry of Heavy Industries, and it involves financial incentives. Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect; EMPS likely promotes various electric vehicles, not just two-wheelers, and its scope is not limited to rural areas.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a government scheme promoting sustainable transportation, requiring the recall of ministerial responsibility and the scheme's key features.  The inclusion of statements that are partially true but lack complete accuracy enhances the question's difficulty.


**9. Consider the following about  "Arogyapacha (Trichopus zeylanicus)":**

1. It is endemic to the Western Ghats.
2. It is used by the Kani tribe for medicinal purposes.
3. It is a large, easily recognizable plant.
4. It has only recently been discovered.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of Arogyapacha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. Arogyapacha is found in the Agastyar hills of Kerala (part of the Western Ghats) and is used by the Kani tribe.  Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect; it's described as a small plant, and its discovery is not a recent event.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific medicinal plant, demanding precise recall of its geographical location, traditional uses, and physical characteristics.  The inclusion of distractors related to the plant's size and discovery timeline increases the challenge.


**10. Consider the following regarding  "Mitakshara Law":**

1. It is the only school of Hindu law governing property succession.
2. It recognizes the concept of coparcenary.
3. It was primarily based on the commentary by Jimutuvahana.
4. It historically excluded women from coparcenary rights.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding Mitakshara Law?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Mitakshara Law does recognize coparcenary, and it historically excluded women. Statement 1 is incorrect; there's also the Dayabhaga school. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the commentary is attributed to Vijnaneswara, not Jimutuvahana.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of a key aspect of Hindu law, demanding precise recall of its core principles and historical context. The inclusion of distractors related to the number of schools and the author of the primary commentary enhances the question's difficulty.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, the difficulty is designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates by incorporating subtle nuances and plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021:**

1. Termination of pregnancy is allowed up to 20 weeks for all women based on a single doctor's advice.
2.  Between 20 and 24 weeks, termination is restricted to specific categories of women requiring two doctors' advice.
3. Beyond 24 weeks, termination is permissible only in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, requiring a medical board's approval.
4. The Act explicitly excludes unmarried women from accessing abortion services.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the key provisions of the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021.  The Act establishes a tiered system for abortion access based on gestational age and specific circumstances.  Statement 4 is incorrect; a significant Supreme Court ruling in 2022 extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried and single women, explicitly negating the exclusion implied in statement 4.  The other options are incorrect because they underrepresent the number of accurate statements. Option (d) is particularly misleading because it includes the factually incorrect statement 4.  Understanding the nuances of the Act, including the Supreme Court's interpretation, is crucial for a correct response.


**2. Consider the following features of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  It defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse.
2.  The Act's coverage extends to all women in shared households, regardless of their relationship to the abuser.
3.  Complaints can be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself.
4. Reliefs under PWDVA are mutually exclusive of other legal proceedings.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of the PWDVA, 2005?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 accurately reflects a key feature of the PWDVA, 2005. The Act's broad definition of domestic violence includes physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse, making statement 1 incorrect.  Furthermore, the Act allows complaints to be filed by the aggrieved person, a Protection Officer, or any other person on their behalf, contradicting statement 3.  Finally, the Act explicitly states that remedies under PWDVA can be sought alongside other legal proceedings (like divorce petitions or Section 498A IPC cases), making statement 4 incorrect. The carefully constructed distractors aim to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding initiatives to promote women in STEM fields in India:**

1. The Boeing Sukanya Program focuses solely on providing scholarships to women aspiring to be pilots.
2. I-STEM primarily aims at creating a database of research infrastructure and labs for women scientists.
3. Vigyan Jyoti is a program specifically designed for girls in higher education to pursue STEM careers.
4. KIRAN is a scheme that encourages women scientists in S&T by providing extramural research grants.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the stated aims of these initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 correctly capture the primary aims of the mentioned initiatives. The Boeing Sukanya program, while including scholarships for aspiring pilots, also focuses on creating STEM labs for young girls to spark interest in STEM careers, making statement 1 incorrect.  I-STEM provides a platform for access to research infrastructure for users across India, not solely for women scientists, as claimed in statement 2. Vigyan Jyoti targets meritorious girls in high school, not higher education, as stated in statement 3.  KIRAN indeed encourages women scientists in S&T but its focus on providing extramural research grants is accurate.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of each program's scope and objectives.


**4. Consider the following provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1.  The Act defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact or advances.
2. The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is mandatory for all organizations regardless of their size.
3.  The Act covers only women employed in the organized sector.
4.  Conciliation under the POSH Act can involve monetary settlements.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the POSH Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is partially correct. The ICC is mandatory for organizations with 10 or more employees, not all organizations as stated.  Statement 1 is incorrect as the POSH Act's definition is broader, including physical contact, demands for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, pornography, and other unwelcome sexual conduct.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the Act covers women in both organized and unorganized sectors, including clients, customers, and domestic workers.  Statement 4 is incorrect as the Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements during conciliation.  The incorrect options are deliberately close to the truth to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the POSH Act.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person below 16 years of age.
2.  The Act mandates that all offences committed by juveniles are tried in a Children's Court.
3.  The 2021 amendment to the Act removed the provision for trying 16-18-year-olds as adults for heinous offences.
4.  The Act provides for appeals against orders made by Child Welfare Committees.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 (and subsequent amendments)?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is partially correct. While the Act does provide for trying certain offences involving children aged 16-18 in a Children's Court, the 2015 Act *did* include a provision to try such children as adults for heinous offences,  a provision which the 2021 amendment did not remove. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act defines a child as someone below 18.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the provision to try 16-18 year olds as adults for heinous offenses remained. Statement 4 is incorrect, initially there was no appeal provision for Child Welfare Committee orders, a provision that was added by the 2021 amendment.  The options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the evolution of the Act.


These questions demand precise knowledge and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies within seemingly similar statements.  They are designed to be challenging and reflective of the high standards expected in the UPSC exam.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs are recognized at the state level, based on socio-economic criteria.
2.  The highest number of PVTGs in India is found in Madhya Pradesh.
3.  A declining population is one of the criteria for identifying PVTGs.
4.  The term "Primitive Tribal Groups" (PTGs) was replaced by "PVTGs" in 2006.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. A declining or stagnant population is indeed one of the criteria used to identify PVTGs.  Statement 4 is also correct; the renaming occurred in 2006.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. PVTGs are recognized at the *central* level, not the state level.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, houses the highest number of PVTGs. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following statements related to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorized DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated the DNT population to be around 15 crore.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 unjustly labeled DNTs as inherently criminal. Statement 3 is also correct: The Renke Commission estimated the combined population of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs to be around 15 crore. Statement 4 is correct: August 31st is indeed celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.



**3. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) aims to prepare a nationwide list of DNTs.
2.  The "SEED" scheme focuses on providing free competitive exam coaching to DNT students.
3.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for all tribal welfare schemes.
4.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNT boys and girls.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct descriptions of existing initiatives. The NCDNT works on creating state-wise lists, the SEED scheme offers exam coaching, and the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on hostel construction. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a significant role, it's not the sole nodal ministry for *all* tribal welfare schemes.  Other ministries, such as the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, are also involved.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.



**4. Consider the following features of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  It provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to the age of 18.
4.  The Act does not apply to police forces.


Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The act recognizes a broad range of disabilities, provides for free education, and explicitly excludes police forces from reservation provisions. However, statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Act does mandate reservation, it specifies  at least 4%, not 5%, in government jobs, and  at least 5% in higher educational institutions. Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 are entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements about manual scavenging:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines.
2.  The Act prescribes a punishment of up to two years imprisonment for employing manual scavengers.
3.  Safal karamcharis are not considered manual scavengers under the Act.
4.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate reflections of the Act's provisions.  The Act does indeed prescribe penalties for employing manual scavengers and includes provisions for their rehabilitation. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act mandates the *conversion* of insanitary latrines, not necessarily their immediate demolition. Statement 3 is also incorrect: Safal karamcharis, even if working in seemingly safer conditions, are still considered manual scavengers if they handle human waste without proper protective gear. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least four languages for all students.
3.  Board examinations for Grades 10 and 12 will be offered only once a year.
4.  It integrates contributions of Indians to knowledge across different disciplines.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 accurately represent features of the NCF-SE. The 5+3+3+4 structure is a core element, and the framework does integrate Indian contributions to knowledge. However, statement 2 is incorrect; it proposes proficiency in at least *three*, not four, languages. Statement 3 is also incorrect; it allows students to take board exams on at least *two* occasions.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  PGI assesses performance at the state and district levels.
2.  PGI 2.0 data was primarily based on UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 data.
3.  In PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').
4.  PGI-D focuses solely on the infrastructure aspects of schools.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. PGI assesses performance at both levels, uses the specified data sources, and correctly notes that no state/UT achieved the highest grade in PGI 2.0. However, statement 4 is incorrect. PGI-D considers various aspects, including outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety, not just infrastructure. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  It aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.
2.  It proposes a single exit option for undergraduate degrees.
3.  It advocates for the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4.  It seeks to establish a National Research Foundation (NRF).


Which of the above statements are correct aspects of NEP 2020?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate reflections of NEP 2020's goals. The policy aims for the specified GER, advocates for MERUs, and proposes the creation of an NRF.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; NEP 2020 advocates for *multiple* exit options, not a single one, for undergraduate degrees.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs):**

1.  Institutions less than 20 years old are now eligible to apply for DtbU status.
2.  A cluster of institutions under a single sponsoring body can apply for DtbU status.
3.  DtbUs must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
4.  The UGC Act of 1956 empowers the state governments to declare institutions as DtbUs.


How many of the statements above correctly describe DtbUs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The new regulations allow younger institutions to apply, mandate ABC identities, and correctly identify the UGC Act as the basis for DtbU status. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the new regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by *more than one* sponsoring body to apply, not just a single one. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**10. Consider the following regarding the UGC regulations for setting up campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India:**

1.  FHEIs need UGC approval before establishing campuses in India.
2.  FHEIs ranked within the top 1000 globally are eligible to apply.
3.  FHEIs can offer programs in online or open and distance learning modes.
4.  FHEIs must comply with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999).


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the regulations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The regulations require UGC approval and mandate compliance with the Foreign Exchange Management Act.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the eligibility criterion is a ranking within the top 500, not 1000. Statement 3 is also incorrect; online and distance learning modes are specifically prohibited. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.


**11. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of 10 levels to categorize educational achievements.
3.  It includes the concept of "notional learning hours."
4.  It is solely managed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).


How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are largely correct. NCrF does integrate credits, incorporates the concept of notional learning hours, and involves multiple stakeholders beyond just the UGC. However, statement 2 is incorrect. NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 10.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.  The involvement of AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and various ministries makes statement 4 partially inaccurate.


**12. Consider the following about the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  They allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
2.  They permit single women to undergo surrogacy using donor eggs and self-sperm.
3.  They maintain the ban on commercial surrogacy.
4.  They were notified by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the amendment rules?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The rules allow donor gametes under specific conditions and maintain the ban on commercial surrogacy. However, statement 2 is incorrect; single women must use self-eggs and donor sperm, not the other way around. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the rules were notified by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**13. Consider the following regarding the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report:**

1.  It is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  It provides data on various health indicators, including maternal mortality rates.
3.  It's conducted every five years.
4.  It covers all states and Union Territories of India.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are generally correct. NFHS-5 is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, provides comprehensive health data including maternal mortality, is conducted at roughly five-year intervals, and covers the entire country.  While specific details might vary slightly between surveys, the overall description is accurate. Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**14.  Consider the following related to the Anganwadi system:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the state governments.
3.  The ‘Poshan Tracker’ app is used for monitoring nutrition service delivery.
4.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Anganwadi system is a part of ICDS, and the Poshan Tracker app is used for monitoring. However, statement 2 is partially incorrect; while AWWs receive a fixed honorarium, it's from the *central* government, supplemented by states. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Saksham Anganwadi has broader aims beyond just nutrition, including early childhood care and education.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct.


**15. Consider the following concerning the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  It uses four key indicators to assess hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
4.  The GHI methodology has faced criticism from the Indian government.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the GHI?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The GHI uses four indicators (undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality), and the Indian government has indeed criticized its methodology. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while there have been some improvements, the progress has been limited and inconsistent. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are entirely accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims for "difficult," employing plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the largest absolute number of STs.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTGs.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of officially recognized PVTGs.
4.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; while Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population, Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs. Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate reflections of PVTG characteristics and governance.  The question plays on the difference between overall ST population and the specific categorization of PVTGs, creating a plausible distractor.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect facts about the history, demographics, and commemoration related to DNTs.  The inclusion of statement 1 as a distractor tests the candidate's precise understanding of the DNT definition.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  Reservation under the Act applies to all police forces in India.
4.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act explicitly excludes certain police forces from the reservation mandate.  The other three statements accurately reflect provisions of the Act. This question tests detailed knowledge of the Act's provisions and exceptions.


**4. Consider the following about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It bans manual scavenging.
2.  It prescribes a punishment of up to two years imprisonment or a fine up to one lakh rupees, or both, for violations.
3.  It defines manual scavengers as only those employed to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
4.  It mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is incorrect; the act has a broader definition of manual scavengers encompassing those handling undecomposed human waste from various sources, not solely those working in sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.  Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the Act's key provisions.  The inaccurate definition in statement 3 acts as a significant distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
3.  It maintains hard separations between academic and vocational subjects.
4.  It emphasizes capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is incorrect; the NCF-SE advocates for flexibility and choice, blurring lines between academic and vocational subjects.  The other statements correctly reflect the framework's key features.  The contrasting nature of statement 3 with the others makes it a strong distractor.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of eight levels to categorize education.
3.  It only allows credits earned through formal academic programs to be transferred.
4.  It introduces the concept of "notional learning hours."

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is incorrect; the NCrF is designed to be inclusive, allowing credits from various learning pathways (experiential, vocational, etc.) to be integrated.  Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the NCrF. The broad inclusivity of the NCrF contrasted with the restrictive nature of statement 3 makes for a challenging distractor.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.
2.  The Department of Science and Technology is the administrative department for the NRF.
3.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
4.  The NRF is solely funded through grants and loans from the central government.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 4 is incorrect; the NRF's funding sources are diverse, including donations, investment income, and existing funds.  The other three statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.  The nuanced funding mechanism in statement 4 provides a difficult distractor.


**8.  Consider the following concerning the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  They allow surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition.
2.  They permit single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor sperm and their own eggs.
3.  They explicitly permit commercial surrogacy.
4.  They establish the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. Statement 3 contradicts the focus on altruistic surrogacy, while statement 4 describes a body established by the 2021 Act, not the 2024 amendment. Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect changes introduced by the 2024 amendments.  The inclusion of statements referencing pre-existing legislation and the core principles of the Surrogacy Act create a high level of difficulty.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It is released annually by the United Nations.
2.  It measures hunger levels using indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the UN, and India's GHI score has shown slight improvement but not consistent improvement since 2015.  Statements 2 and 4 accurately describe the index and India's response to it. The incorrect attribution of the GHI's authorship and the nuanced nature of India's score changes create a complex distractor scenario.


**10. Consider the following about the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):**

1.  It monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
2.  It is composed of government representatives from member states.
3.  India is a state party to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
4.  It primarily focuses on economic and social development issues.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 is incorrect; the UNCRC is comprised of independent experts, not government representatives. Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly describe the UNCRC's function, India's participation, and its broad mandate. The nature of the committee's membership forms the basis for a difficult distractor.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the largest PVTG population in absolute numbers.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTG welfare.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
4. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.
5.  The UN Dhebar Commission (1961) initially recognized PVTGs as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct.  Madhya Pradesh does indeed have the highest number of STs, a group that includes PVTGs.  The criteria listed in statement 3 accurately reflect the established guidelines for PVTG identification.  The UN Dhebar Commission's 1961 recommendations formed the basis for the initial recognition of these groups, later renamed PVTGs.

Statement 2 is partially correct; the Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a significant role, but other ministries also contribute to PVTG welfare. This makes the statement not entirely accurate.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, has the highest number of PVTGs. Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


**2. Consider the following about Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Hakki Pikki tribe of Karnataka is a semi-nomadic group.
4.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.
5.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 wrongly categorized DNTs. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a well-known semi-nomadic group.  The Renke Commission provided the population estimate.  August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day.

Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  The Act mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.
4.  The Act excludes police forces from reservation provisions for PwDs.
5. The Office of Chief Commissioner of PwDs is under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements correctly reflect aspects of the RPwD Act. The Act specifies reservation percentages for PwDs in both higher education and government jobs (though the percentage for jobs might vary slightly depending on interpretation).  It lists 21 types of disabilities. Free education is mandated for eligible children. Police forces are specifically excluded from reservation policies under the act. The Office of Chief Commissioner is indeed under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.


**4. Consider the following statements about Manual Scavenging:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) bans manual scavenging.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste without appropriate protective gear.
3.  The PEMSR Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines.
4.  The Safal Karamcharis are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under PEMSR.
5.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Eco-system aims to eliminate manual scavenging.

Which of the statements above accurately describe aspects of manual scavenging and related legislation?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 5
(c) 2, 4, and 5
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits manual scavenging.  Constructing insanitary latrines is an offense under the act. The National Policy aims for mechanization to eliminate the practice.

Statement 2 is partially correct but not fully accurate. While the act addresses the handling of human waste, its definition is broader and includes various contexts. Statement 4 is incorrect; Safal Karamcharis, depending on their work conditions, *can* fall under the definition of manual scavengers. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 5 completely align with the provided information.


**5. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least five languages.
3.  The NCF-SE introduces a semester system for examinations.
4.  The NCF-SE emphasizes interdisciplinary areas of study at the secondary level.
5.  The NCF-SE was last revised in 2005.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The NCF-SE does propose the 5+3+3+4 structure.  It does shift towards a semester system. Interdisciplinary studies are a key feature at the secondary level.  However, the statement that it was last revised in 2005 is incorrect; this revision is more recent.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the NCF-SE promotes proficiency in at least three languages, not five.  Therefore, only four statements accurately describe the NCF-SE.


**6. Consider the following statements related to the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training.
2.  The NCrF establishes a system with eight credit levels.
3.  The NCrF utilizes a "notional learning hours" concept to standardize credit allocation.
4.  The NCrF mandates that all credits earned must be stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).
5.  The NCrF aims to create rigid boundaries between academic and vocational subjects.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NCrF integrates various learning pathways. It has an eight-level credit system. The "notional learning hours" concept is used for standardization.

Statement 4 is incorrect because while the ABC is a significant component, storing credits there isn't strictly mandatory across all scenarios. Statement 5 is incorrect; the framework aims for flexibility and integration, not rigid boundaries.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  The GHI 2023 ranked India among the countries with the highest hunger levels.
3.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, and child mortality.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.
5.  The GHI uses data exclusively from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).


How many of the above statements accurately reflect information about the GHI?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The GHI 2023 did place India in a concerning category. Undernourishment, stunting, and mortality are key indicators. The Indian government has voiced concerns about the GHI's methodology and data sources.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Statement 5 is incorrect; the GHI uses data from multiple sources, not solely the NFHS. Therefore, only three statements accurately represent the GHI.


**8. Consider the following in relation to the Anganwadi system:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and performance-linked incentives.
4.  The Poshan Tracker app aids AWWs in service delivery and monitoring.
5.  The Anganwadi system is exclusively a rural initiative.

How many of the above statements accurately depict the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, are correct. The Anganwadi system falls under the MoWCD. AWWs receive both a fixed honorarium and performance-based incentives. The Poshan Tracker app is a key tool.

Statement 2 is incorrect; Saksham Anganwadi also includes adolescent girls and early childhood care. Statement 5 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system operates in both rural and urban areas.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1.  The NHRC is accredited by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).
2.  The NHRC's accreditation has been deferred by GANHRI on multiple occasions.
3.  The NHRC is responsible for investigating human rights violations in India.
4.  The NHRC's mandate includes promoting human rights education.
5. The NHRC is directly under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the NHRC?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The NHRC's accreditation has faced delays.  It investigates human rights violations.  It promotes human rights education and awareness.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC's accreditation has been deferred, meaning it's not currently accredited. Statement 5 is incorrect; while the government plays a significant role, the NHRC operates with a degree of independence.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

1.  The SDGs National Indicator Framework (NIF) includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
2.  The NIF is static and unchanging.
3.  The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).
4.  India has participated in the IAEG-SDGs.
5.  The GIF and NIF are completely independent and do not share any indicators.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the information about the SDGs framework?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NIF adapts to India's context. The IAEG-SDGs develops the GIF. India has been a member of this group.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF is dynamic and evolves over time. Statement 5 is incorrect; while they have distinct focuses, there's overlap and alignment between the GIF and NIF indicators.  Therefore, only four statements are completely accurate.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:**

1. The policy focuses exclusively on girls and women of reproductive age.
2. The policy prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations.
3. The policy aims to completely eliminate the stigma associated with menstruation.
4.  The policy was released by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the aims and focus of the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while it focuses on girls and women,  the text implies a broader inclusivity of all menstruating individuals. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 3 is slightly exaggerated; the policy aims to reduce stigma, not completely eliminate it. Statement 4 is incorrect; the policy was released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct.  The other options include at least one inaccurate statement.



These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge of the provided text and the ability to critically evaluate the given information.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's understanding and ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) aiming for 50% by 2035.
2.  Multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees.
3.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4.  National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation.

How many of the above are salient features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The NEP 2020 aims to significantly reform higher education in India.  A key target is to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035, reflecting an ambitious expansion of access to higher education.  The policy also introduces multiple exit options within undergraduate programs, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees depending on their progress and career goals.  To foster interdisciplinary learning and advanced research, the NEP 2020 proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs). Finally, the creation of a National Research Foundation (NRF) is central to the policy's goal of enhancing research and innovation capabilities across the country. Therefore, all four elements are core components of NEP 2020's higher education strategy.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) for digital storage of academic credits.
2.  Internationalization of education through institutional collaborations.
3.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) for technology in education.
4.  Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) data utilization.

Which of the above are initiatives related to the enhancement of educational infrastructure and technology in India, as per recent policy developments?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is a digital platform designed to store and manage academic credits earned by students from various institutions, enhancing educational flexibility and mobility. The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) aims to leverage technology for improved learning, assessment, and administration in both school and higher education.  While NEP 2020 promotes internationalization and UDISE+ is used for performance assessment, these are not primarily focused on enhancing technological infrastructure in the same way as ABC and NETF. Therefore, only options 1 and 3 directly address technological advancements in the Indian education system.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The highest grade (Daksh) was not achieved by any State/UT in PGI 2.0.
2.  Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the top-most grade (Prachesta-2) in PGI 2.0.
3.  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were in the lowest grade (Akanshi-3) in PGI 2.0.
4.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2.0 for States/UTs and other related educational initiatives in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the results of the Performance Grading Index (PGI) 2.0 for States/UTs, highlighting the performance variations across Indian states and union territories.  Statement 4, while true regarding the NCrF, is not directly related to the PGI 2.0 report.  Therefore, only three of the statements are directly related to the PGI 2.0 findings and reflect the assessment of school education systems.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) promotes multilingualism.
2.  The NCF-SE integrates contributions from Indian knowledge systems across history.
3.  The NCF-SE mandates a binary accreditation system for higher education institutions.
4.  The NCF-SE introduces a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure.

How many of the above statements correctly describe key features of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCF-SE emphasizes multilingualism, aiming to improve proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages. It also incorporates contributions from Indian knowledge systems throughout history, enriching the curriculum with indigenous perspectives.  The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the earlier four-stage system.  However, the statement about a binary accreditation system is incorrect; this is a recommendation from a separate committee on higher education accreditation, not a direct feature of the NCF-SE.  Therefore, three out of the four statements accurately reflect the features of the NCF-SE.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Medical Commission (NMC) received WFME recognition for 10 years.
2.  The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947.
3.  The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) supports the establishment of Vidya Samiksha Kendras (VSKs).
4.  The National Syllabus and Teaching Learning Material Committee (NSTC) developed the curriculum for grades 1-12.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect recent developments in India's education and healthcare regulatory frameworks?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The National Medical Commission (NMC) indeed secured recognition from the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) for a decade. The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, aims to replace the older Indian Nursing Council Act. The National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) is instrumental in setting up Vidya Samiksha Kendras (VSKs). However, the NSTC is responsible for grades 3-12, not 1-12.  Therefore, only three statements correctly reflect the recent changes.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status.
2.  The UGC Regulations, 2023, mandate the creation of Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for students in Deemed-to-be Universities.
3.  The UGC Regulations, 2023, permit Deemed-to-be Universities to start new courses without prior approval from any statutory council.
4.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) require UGC approval before establishing Indian campuses.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the salient features of the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, and related regulations on foreign higher educational institutions in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2023 UGC regulations for Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs) do indeed lower the age requirement for applying for DtbU status, making institutions less than 20 years old eligible.  They also mandate the creation of ABC identities for students in DtbUs.  However, the statement about starting new courses without prior approval from any statutory council is incorrect; while DtbUs have some autonomy, approvals are still required from the Executive Council and relevant statutory bodies where applicable. The statement about FHEIs needing UGC approval is accurate, reflecting the regulatory framework for foreign institutions in India.  Therefore, three out of the four statements correctly represent the key features of the regulations.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) divides education into eight levels.
2.  The NCrF encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).
3.  The NCrF fixes total notional learning hours for school, college, vocational, and skill education at 1200 hours/year.
4.  The NCrF prohibits multiple entry and exit options in the educational ecosystem.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the key highlights of the National Credit Framework (NCrF) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The NCrF indeed divides education into eight levels, integrating school, higher, and vocational education.  It also brings together the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF for credit integration and transfer. The NCrF establishes a standard of 1200 notional learning hours per year across different educational pathways.  However, the statement about prohibiting multiple entry and exit options is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly promotes flexibility and lifelong learning through multiple entry and exit points.  Therefore, three out of the four statements correctly describe the NCrF's key highlights.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a composite assessment system (CAS) for higher education accreditation.
2.  The committee suggested a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
3.  The committee recommended that the transition to the proposed accreditation regime should be completed by December 2023, irrespective of the establishment of the National Accreditation Council (NAC).
4.  The NAC is one of the four verticals of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee on the reforms in the accreditation system of Higher Educational Institutions in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations included a shift towards a composite assessment system (CAS), combining program and institutional accreditation for a more holistic evaluation. The committee also proposed a transition to a binary accreditation system, simplifying the assessment process to "Accredited" or "Not Accredited" with sub-categories for those awaiting accreditation or far below standards.  The committee's report emphasized the importance of transitioning to the new system by December 2023, even before the full establishment of the National Accreditation Council (NAC).  Finally, the NAC is indeed one of the four verticals of the HECI, highlighting its role in the overall higher education regulatory framework.  Therefore, all four statements accurately represent the committee's key recommendations.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The 2023 India Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) introduced a new subject category: Agriculture & Allied Sectors.
2.  The 2023 India Rankings integrated the Atal Ranking of Institutions on Innovation Achievements (ARIIA) into the overall rankings.
3.  The 2023 India Rankings expanded the scope of "Architecture" to include "Architecture and Planning".
4.  The India Rankings are solely based on the academic reputation of the institutions.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the 2023 edition of India Rankings of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 2023 India Rankings did indeed introduce a new subject category for Agriculture & Allied Sectors, reflecting the growing importance of this field.  The ARIIA rankings were integrated into the overall India Rankings to better assess the innovation capabilities of institutions.  The scope of "Architecture" was also broadened to encompass "Architecture and Planning".  However, the statement that the rankings are solely based on academic reputation is incorrect; the NIRF framework considers multiple parameters, including teaching, learning resources, research, graduation outcomes, and inclusivity, in addition to perception. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the features of the 2023 India Rankings.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report provides data on various health indicators.
2.  The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to ensure access to quality health services without financial hardship.
3.  The Anganwadi system focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years.
4.  The Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus model village sustains ODF status and observes visual cleanliness.

How many of the above statements accurately describe various aspects of health, nutrition, and sanitation initiatives in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The NFHS-5 report is a comprehensive source of data on various health indicators in India. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) aims to provide equitable access to quality healthcare services without imposing financial burdens on individuals. The Anganwadi system plays a vital role in improving the nutritional and health status of young children.  The ODF Plus model village goes beyond basic sanitation, incorporating visual cleanliness and waste management.  Therefore, all four statements accurately describe important aspects of health, nutrition, and sanitation initiatives in India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues in education and related areas.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The NCF-SE introduces a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, replacing the existing four-stage system (statement 1 is incorrect). It strongly emphasizes scientific inquiry skills alongside theoretical knowledge (statement 2 is correct).  The NCF-SE advocates for flexibility and choice, eliminating hard separations between academic and vocational streams (statement 3 is incorrect). While environmental education is integrated throughout schooling, it culminates in a distinct area of study at the secondary level, making statement 4 partially incorrect.  Therefore, only one statement is entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It is a framework exclusively for higher education.
2.  It uses a system of 10 levels to categorize educational achievements.

Which of the above are features of the NCrF?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The NCrF is an inclusive framework integrating credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education (statement 1 is incorrect). It uses an 8-level system, not 10 (statement 2 is incorrect).  Experiential learning, such as industry experience, contributes to credit accumulation (statement 3 is correct).  The NCrF explicitly aims to enhance flexibility and mobility across different educational pathways (statement 4 is incorrect).


**3. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  It assesses performance at the national level only.
2.  The PGI 2.0 uses data solely from the 2021-22 academic year.
3.  All states and union territories achieved the highest grade in PGI 2.0.
4.  The PGI-D focuses on aspects like effective classroom transactions.


How many of the statements above are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate. The PGI assesses performance at both state and district levels (statement 1 is incorrect). PGI 2.0 utilizes data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 (statement 2 is correct). No state or union territory achieved the highest grade in PGI 2.0 (statement 3 is incorrect). The PGI-D specifically includes factors like effective classroom transactions and school safety (statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs):**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, require institutions to be at least 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status can start new courses without any prior approval.
3.  The NCERT has recently been granted DtBU status.
4.  A cluster of institutions managed by a single sponsoring body can apply for DtBU status.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply (statement 1 is incorrect).  New courses require prior approval from the Executive Council and relevant bodies (statement 2 is incorrect).  The NCERT was indeed granted DtBU status (statement 3 is correct). The 2023 regulations permit clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies to apply (statement 4 is incorrect).


**5. Consider the following about the  Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  In the 2023 GHI, India's ranking improved significantly compared to 2015.
3.  The GHI considers factors like undernourishment and child mortality.
4.  The Indian government has not raised objections regarding the GHI methodology.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe (statement 1 is incorrect).  India's improvement in GHI score from 2015 to 2023 was marginal (statement 2 is incorrect).  Undernourishment and child mortality are key indicators in the GHI (statement 3 is correct). The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology (statement 4 is incorrect).


**6. Consider the following regarding the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA):**

1. Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
2.  It released the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the World Health Organization.
3.  One of its key targets is to end preventable maternal deaths.
4. The State of World Population Report is one of its publications.


Which of the above statements are true about the UNFPA?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. UNFPA's headquarters are in New York (statement 1 is incorrect).  It collaborated with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), not WHO (statement 2 is incorrect).  Ending preventable maternal deaths is a key UNFPA objective (statement 3 is correct).  The UNFPA publishes the State of World Population Report (statement 4 is correct).


**7. Consider these aspects of the  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF):**

1. It is primarily focused on school education.
2. It aims to enhance learning through technology in higher education.
3. It is a platform for paid commercial exchange of educational technology.
4. It is primarily concerned with assessment and administration in schools and higher education.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the NETF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Although it supports school education, the NETF's scope extends to higher education (statement 1 is partially correct). It promotes free exchange of ideas on using technology for learning, assessment, and administration in both sectors (statements 2 and 4 are correct).  It is not a commercial platform (statement 3 is incorrect). Therefore, only three statements partially or fully reflect the NETF's functions.


**8. Consider the following about the  National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF):**

1. State Disaster Response Funds (SDRFs) must be fully utilized before seeking funds from the NDRF.
2. The NDRF receives funding solely from the Central Government.
3. The NDRF is primarily used for responding to natural disasters.
4. The NDRF is managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

How many of these statements are correct regarding the NDRF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. States are required to exhaust SDRF funds before approaching the NDRF (statement 1 is correct).  The NDRF is funded entirely by the Central Government (statement 2 is correct).  While the NDRF addresses natural disasters, it also responds to other emergencies (statement 3 is partially correct). The NDRF is managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements are fully correct.


**9. Consider these characteristics of the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1. It defines an Open Defecation Free (ODF) village as one with no visible faeces and every household and public institution using safe sanitation.
2.  An ODF Plus village has sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village must have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
4.  Visual cleanliness is not a criterion for ODF Plus Model village status.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The definition of an ODF village aligns with statement 1.  The description of ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model villages matches statements 2 and 3. Visual cleanliness is a requirement for ODF Plus Model village status, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. It is a constitutional body.
2. It was established in accordance with the Paris Principles.
3. It is primarily focused on addressing the human rights of children.
4. It has the power to arrest individuals for human rights violations.

How many of the statements are accurate about the NHRC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 is correct. The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional one (statement 1 is incorrect). It was established in line with the Paris Principles (statement 2 is correct).  While it addresses children's rights, its mandate is broader (statement 3 is partially correct). The NHRC does not have the power of arrest (statement 4 is incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements are fully or partially correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the provided material.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and may vary depending on the individual's prior knowledge.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) are permitted surrogacy using self-eggs and donor sperm.
3.  The rules maintain the 2022 prohibition on the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.
4.  The amendment explicitly addresses the Supreme Court's ruling in the Arun Muthuvel case.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the changes introduced by the 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act.  Statement 4 is also correct; the amendment implicitly acknowledges and responds to the Supreme Court's decision in the Arun Muthuvel case, which concerned a woman with MRKH Syndrome. However, statement 3 is incorrect because the 2024 rules *overturn* the 2022 prohibition on donor gametes, introducing specific conditions for their use.


**2. Consider the following features of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  It defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse.
2.  It provides remedies for women in a domestic relationship, including mothers, sisters, and partners.
3.  A complaint can be filed against the husband's relatives, encompassing both male and female relatives.
4.  Reliefs under PWDVA can be sought alongside other legal proceedings, such as divorce petitions.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; PWDVA defines domestic violence more broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse in addition to sexual abuse. Statements 2, 3, and 4 are all accurate reflections of the Act's provisions.  The Supreme Court ruling in the *Hiral P Harsora* case further broadens the definition of who can be held accountable under the Act.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It defines manual scavengers as those handling decomposed human waste using protective gear.
2.  It mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines and construction of sanitary ones.
3.  It criminalizes the employment of manual scavengers for cleaning insanitary latrines.
4.  It provides for rehabilitation through alternate employment and financial assistance but excludes property purchase assistance.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the PEMSR Act's provisions. The Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging by prohibiting the practice and promoting the construction of sanitary facilities. Statement 1 is incorrect; it defines manual scavengers as those handling *undecomposed* human waste *without* protective gear. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act does provide for property purchase assistance as part of the rehabilitation process.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF frameworks.
2.  It allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning and industrial experience.
3.  It mandates a uniform 1200 notional learning hours per year across all educational levels.
4.  It strictly adheres to a rigid system of entry and exit points throughout the educational pathway.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe key aspects of the NCrF. The framework aims to integrate various learning pathways, including non-traditional forms of learning, and proposes a standardized system of credit accumulation. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the NCrF promotes flexibility, it doesn't eliminate all entry and exit restrictions. The framework allows for multiple entry and exit points to facilitate lifelong learning, but not unrestricted movement.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  It mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs, including police forces.
3.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
4.  It establishes special courts in every district to expedite case adjudication.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the provisions of the RPwD Act. The Act aims to promote inclusivity and ensure equal opportunities for PwDs.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the 4% reservation in government jobs does *not* apply to police forces.


**6. Consider the following concerning the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its 2021 amendment:**

1.  The 2015 Act allows for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in heinous offenses.
2.  The 2021 amendment allows District Magistrates to issue adoption orders.
3.  The 2015 Act stipulated that there would be no appeal against Child Welfare Committee orders.
4.  The 2021 amendment redefined "serious offenses," incorporating Supreme Court recommendations from the *Shilpa Mittal* case.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the provisions of the JJ Act, 2015, and its subsequent amendment. The 2015 Act introduced provisions for trying certain older juveniles as adults, and the 2021 amendment altered the adoption process and the definition of serious offenses.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the 2021 amendment introduced an appeal process for adoption orders previously not appealable.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The government initially classified these groups as PTGs in 1973 based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission.  Statement 2 is also correct; these are key criteria used for identifying PVTGs, reflecting their socio-economic vulnerability. Statement 3 is accurate; Odisha does indeed house the largest number of PVTGs. However, statement 4 is partially incorrect. While the Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and the Baiga tribe in Chhattisgarh were granted Habitat Rights, the Kamar tribe's inclusion in this specific grant is not explicitly supported by the provided text.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.  The inclusion of partially true statements as distractors makes this a challenging question, testing the candidate's ability to discern precise factual accuracy.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs represent a subset of nomadic communities historically labeled as criminal.

Statement 3 is correct; the Renke Commission provided this estimate of the combined population of DNTs and nomadic tribes. Statement 4 is also correct; August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day.  The combination of a false statement and three true statements tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate each statement independently, showcasing their understanding of the complexities surrounding DNTs.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the RPwD Act does mandate reservation for PwDs in government jobs, it specifies 4%, not 5%, and also explicitly states that this reservation doesn't apply to police forces. Statement 2 is correct; the Act broadened the definition of disability to include 21 categories, encompassing acid attack victims. Statement 3 is also correct; the Act aims to expedite case resolution through dedicated district-level courts.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ILO's definition of a child in the context of hazardous work aligns with international standards.  Statement 2 is also correct; the 2011 census data reflects a significant number of working children in this age bracket.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the legal prohibition on child labour under the 2016 amendment. However, statement 4 is incorrect.

How many of the above acts directly address the issue of child trafficking or exploitation?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, while not explicitly focused on children, can address instances of child sexual exploitation.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, directly combats a form of child exploitation. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, protects children from organ trafficking. The POCSO Act, 2012, is specifically designed to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, while broader in scope, also addresses the protection and rehabilitation of children who are victims of trafficking or exploitation.  Therefore, four of the listed acts directly or indirectly address child trafficking or exploitation. The question tests factual recall and the ability to understand the overlapping jurisdictions of different laws, a common UPSC theme.



**3. Consider the following regarding the Age of Consent in India:**

1. The POCSO Act, 2012, fixed the age of being categorized as a child at 18 years.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the legal framework surrounding the age of consent in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the legal changes concerning the age of consent. Statement 3 is also correct, highlighting the BNS, 2023 amendment. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The 22nd Law Commission recommended *against* reducing the age of consent.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court in the Independent Thought vs. UoI case *read down* the marital rape exception, not upholding it. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the legal framework. This question tests factual recall, understanding of legal terminology (read down vs. uphold), and the ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate information, crucial for UPSC success.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**

How many of the statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly represent provisions within the Act.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act explicitly states that a transgender child cannot be separated from their parents except by court order. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Act defines a transgender person as someone whose gender *does not* match the gender assigned at birth.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the Act's provisions.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the nuances of legislation, a critical skill for UPSC.


**5. Consider the following about the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

How many of the above statements accurately represent the key features of the PWDVA, 2005?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 accurately reflects a key feature of the PWDVA.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act includes physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect; it covers women in various domestic relationships. Statement 3 is incorrect; complaints can be filed by others on behalf of the aggrieved woman. Statement 5 is incorrect; reliefs can be sought concurrently with other legal proceedings.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the scope and limitations of a specific law, crucial for UPSC preparation.  The inclusion of incorrect statements designed to appear plausible makes the question challenging.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended:**

1.  The MTP Act allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under all circumstances.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning the MTP Act and its amendments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The MTP Act, as amended, allows termination beyond 24 weeks under specific circumstances, primarily fetal abnormalities. The 2021 amendment explicitly included survivors of rape or incest. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the time limit varies based on circumstances. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court ruled that for the purposes of the MTP Act, marital rape *is* considered rape.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the POSH Act?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 5 correctly reflect the POSH Act's provisions. The ICC does have powers similar to a civil court, and the Act provides a comprehensive definition of sexual harassment.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the threshold for mandatory ICCs is 10 or more employees, not 5. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act covers women in both organized and unorganized sectors. Statement 4 is incorrect; the time limit for filing a complaint is three months, not one month. Therefore, only two statements are accurate. This question tests detailed knowledge of the POSH Act, requiring recall of specific numerical details and understanding of its scope, making it a challenging question for UPSC aspirants.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. Article 342 does define Scheduled Tribes; Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs; the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry; and the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the ST population is closer to 8.6% than 10%, based on the 2011 census data. Therefore, four of the statements are correct. This question tests factual recall of data related to India's tribal population and relevant constitutional provisions, requiring precise knowledge for correct answering.


**10. Consider the following about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India:**

1.  PVTGs were initially identified as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) can use donor sperm and their own eggs for surrogacy.
3.  The rules explicitly permit traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child.
4.  The amendment allows for commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, allows for surrogacy with donor gametes in cases where the intending couple faces medical conditions that necessitate it, with the crucial condition that the child must inherit at least one gamete from the intending couple. This addresses a previous prohibition on using donor gametes.

Statement 2 is also correct. The rules now explicitly permit single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm. This expands access to surrogacy for a wider range of individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments primarily focus on gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically linked, is generally prohibited to uphold ethical standards and prevent exploitation.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, emphasizing altruistic surrogacy where the surrogate mother receives only medical expenses and insurance coverage.  Commercialization is seen as a significant ethical concern.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, has a broader definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  This comprehensive approach recognizes the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PWDVA, 2005, extends protection to a wider range of women beyond just married women.  It includes women who are in a domestic relationship with the abuser, which encompasses cohabiting partners, widows, and other women residing in a shared household.  The Act also extends protection to children in the household.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the aggrieved woman can file a complaint, the PWDVA also allows for complaints to be filed by a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved woman, particularly in situations where the woman might be unable to do so herself.  This provision ensures access to justice even in challenging circumstances.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, does not mandate a specific type of relief for all victims.  The Act provides for a range of reliefs that a Magistrate can grant, including monetary compensation, residence orders, protection orders, custody of children, and medical aid.  The specific relief granted depends on the individual circumstances of each case.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, prohibits discrimination against transgender persons across various aspects of life, including employment, education, healthcare, and access to services. This comprehensive approach aims to ensure equal opportunities for transgender individuals.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act allows for self-perception of gender identity, enabling transgender individuals to obtain a certificate of identity reflecting their chosen gender.  This recognizes the right to self-determination and avoids imposing external criteria for gender recognition.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the central government on policy formulation, programs, legislation, and projects related to the transgender community. This ensures that the concerns and needs of the transgender community are effectively addressed in policymaking.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act mandates that educational institutions provide inclusive education and also ensures that transgender persons have equal access to sports, recreation, and leisure activities. This comprehensive approach aims to foster full participation of transgender individuals in all aspects of education and society.

Statement 2 is correct. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) plays a crucial role in rehabilitating those engaged in manual scavenging by providing financial assistance and training for alternative employment opportunities. This promotes their social and economic upliftment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for procuring sanitation-related equipment to a broader range of individuals and entities, not just private individuals.  This includes those working in sanitation services, fostering entrepreneurship and promoting mechanized sanitation.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The NAMASTE scheme aims to promote 100% mechanization in sanitation across both urban and rural areas. This comprehensive approach seeks to eliminate hazardous manual cleaning practices nationwide.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages. This recognizes the linguistic diversity of India and promotes inclusive education.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The NCF-SE aims to eliminate rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.  It promotes flexibility and choice, allowing students to pursue their interests across various disciplines.


**6. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits only from higher education institutions.
2.  It uses a rigid, inflexible credit transfer system that does not allow for multiple entry and exit points.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key feature of the NCrF is its flexibility, allowing for multiple entry and exit points in the educational ecosystem. This enables lifelong learning and makes education more accessible to individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Notional learning hours, as defined by the NCrF, represent the estimated time required for an average student to complete all coursework, including classes, tests, and assignments. It is not the actual time spent.

Statement 4 is correct. The NCrF integrates the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) and the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), along with the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF), creating a unified framework for credit accumulation and transfer across diverse educational pathways.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee proposed a composite assessment system that would integrate program and institutional accreditation, leading to a more holistic evaluation of higher educational institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The committee suggested that the transition to the proposed accreditation regime could proceed even if the National Accreditation Council (NAC) was established later. This pragmatic approach allows for timely implementation of reforms.

Statement 4 is correct. The committee advocated for a binary system (Accredited/Not Accredited), along with sub-categories for institutions awaiting accreditation.  This acknowledges that institutions may be close to meeting accreditation standards but require additional time.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG only in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs, based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission.  The criteria for identification consistently include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Odisha does house the highest number of PVTGs. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  This detail makes option (c) the only accurate choice. The inclusion of the Bharia tribe's dual PVTG status acts as a key distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.


**2. Consider the following statements about De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.
4.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to prepare a nationwide list of DNT castes.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed as stated, and the Renke Commission provided the population estimate. Statement 4 is also correct; the NCDNT's mandate includes preparing a state-wise list, which is a key element of its function. The incorrect statement 1 acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced relationship between DNTs and nomadic communities.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3.  Reservation under the Act applies to all police forces in India.
4.  The Act defines "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Act specifies reservation percentages for PwDs in higher education and government jobs (although the exact percentages may vary slightly depending on the specific context), includes acid attack victims as a recognized disability category, and defines "benchmark disability" as stated. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the reservation provisions explicitly exclude certain police forces. This incorrect statement serves as a crucial distractor, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act bans manual scavenging but allows it with appropriate protective gear.
2.  The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.
3.  The Act makes it an offence to employ people to clean sewers without protective gear.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are accurate reflections of the PEMSR Act's provisions.  The Act does mandate the elimination of insanitary latrines and prohibits employing individuals for sewer cleaning without proper safety equipment. Statement 1 is partially correct in that the law permits cleaning with appropriate gear, but the overall intent is to completely phase out manual scavenging. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act assigns responsibility to various authorities, including municipalities, panchayats, cantonment boards, and railway authorities.  The partially correct statement 1 and the incorrect statement 4 create effective distractors.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes.
3.  The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of tribal welfare policies and initiatives. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a central role, Madhya Pradesh holds the highest ST population, the specified date is correct, and the principle of respecting tribal values and avoiding imposition is a core tenet of many policies.  There are no misleading elements in this question; it tests the candidate's overall understanding of the government's approach to tribal welfare.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.

4.  The NCF-SE strictly separates academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 correctly reflect the NCF-SE's recommendations.  The new age-based structure and emphasis on multilingualism are key features. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the framework allows for multiple attempts at board exams. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the framework aims to integrate academic and vocational subjects rather than maintain a strict separation.  The incorrect statements act as distractors, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the NCF-SE's approach to curriculum design.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  The PGI assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  The PGI uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The PGI does assess performance at both levels, the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 report showed no state/UT at the highest grade, and the PGI-D report covers various aspects, including classroom transaction effectiveness. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the PGI utilizes data from multiple sources, including UDISE+. The use of multiple data sources in statement 2 serves as a significant distractor, requiring the candidate to possess specific knowledge of the PGI's methodology.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  The NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035.
2.  The NEP 2020 proposes a rigid, four-year undergraduate degree structure without exit options.
3.  The NEP 2020 advocates for the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4.  The NEP 2020 discourages the internationalization of higher education in India.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are accurate representations of the NEP 2020's goals and recommendations.  The policy does aim for a 50% GER increase and promotes the establishment of MERUs. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NEP supports multiple exit options within the undergraduate degree structure. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NEP actively encourages international collaborations and the entry of top global universities into India. The incorrect statements 2 and 4 act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's in-depth understanding of the NEP's flexible approach.


**9. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  The NCrF aims to integrate credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational training.
2.  The NCrF is solely focused on higher education qualifications.
3.  The NCrF encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) but not the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).
4.  The NCrF was developed by a committee consisting only of UGC members.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 accurately describes the NCrF's primary objective – seamless integration of credits across different educational pathways. Statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The NCrF is not limited to higher education; it includes vocational training and school education. It encompasses both NHEQF and NSQF. The NCrF's development involved a broader committee, not solely UGC members. The incorrect statements 2, 3, and 4 are designed as distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the framework's components and development process.


**10. Consider the following statements about organizations involved in international development:**

1.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is primarily focused on issues related to industrial development.
3.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) works in over 130 countries.
4.  The World Food Programme (WFP) was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. IFPRI's affiliation with CGIAR is accurate, UNHCR's global presence is substantial, and the WFP did receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Statement 2 is incorrect; UNFPA's focus is on population and reproductive health, not industrial development. The inclusion of the incorrect statement 2 serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of these organizations’ specific mandates.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  The Anganwadi system falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  The primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium and a performance-linked incentive.
4.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the infrastructure of Anganwadi Centers (AWCs).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is indeed a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD). Its primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition. AWWs receive a fixed honorarium and a performance-linked incentive as part of their compensation.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while Saksham Anganwadi does focus on strengthening AWCs, it also has broader goals, including focusing on adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.  The inclusion of this misleading statement increases the difficulty of the question.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
3.  National Health Policy 2017
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush
5.  Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY)

Which of the above are primarily focused on improving access to and the quality of healthcare services?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, ABDM, and National Health Policy 2017 directly address improving access to and the quality of healthcare services.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush aims to improve child and maternal health, indirectly contributing to UHC goals.  PMJJBY, however, is a health insurance scheme, not directly focused on healthcare service provision or access.  Including PMJJBY as a distractor requires careful consideration of the nuanced differences between health insurance and healthcare service delivery.  This makes the question more challenging for the candidate.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Health Organization (WHO).
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score has shown consistent improvement since 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WHO. Statement 2 is correct; South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently rank poorly. Statement 3 is incorrect; while India's score has improved slightly, it hasn't shown consistent improvement since 2015. Statement 4 is correct; the Indian government has voiced concerns about the GHI's methodology, sample size, and data sources.  The inclusion of factually close but incorrect statements, like the WHO releasing the GHI, makes the question more challenging.


**4. Consider the following concerning the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan:**

1.  It was launched in 2017.
2.  It aims to reduce stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children.
3.  It primarily utilizes the Anganwadi system for service delivery.
4.  It is solely managed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The POSHAN Abhiyan was launched in 2017, aims to reduce malnutrition indicators, and heavily relies on the Anganwadi system for implementation. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is involved, the NNM is a multi-ministerial initiative, with the Ministry of Women and Child Development playing a significant role. The inclusion of the incorrect statement about the single ministry responsible for the POSHAN Abhiyan increases the difficulty level significantly.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  It provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to age 18.
4.  It excludes police forces from the reservation policy for PwDs.
5.  It establishes a special court in each district for faster adjudication of cases.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The Act does mandate reservations, recognizes multiple disability types, ensures free education, specifically excludes certain police forces from the reservation, and provides for special courts.  This question tests thorough factual recall of the Act's key features.


**6.  Consider the following regarding Manual Scavenging in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, completely eradicated manual scavenging.
2.  The Act penalizes those employing manual scavengers.
3.  The Act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines.
4.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to provide alternative employment options.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The 2013 Act criminalizes the employment of manual scavengers, mandates the conversion of insanitary latrines, and includes a rehabilitation scheme.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging, it hasn't completely eradicated the practice.  The inclusion of the blatantly false statement about complete eradication raises the difficulty.


**7. Consider the following organizations associated with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):**

1.  The World Bank
2.  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
4.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

How many of the above organizations play a significant role in monitoring or reporting on SDG progress?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All four organizations listed play a significant role in monitoring or reporting on SDG progress. The World Bank contributes data and analysis, UNDESA releases regular progress reports, UNFPA focuses on population-related goals, and IFPRI contributes research on food security and related SDGs.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their roles in global development initiatives.


**8. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It advocates for a holistic approach to education, encompassing various disciplines.
2.  It emphasizes the development of scientific inquiry skills.
3.  It mandates the inclusion of environmental education at all stages.
4.  It recommends a rigid, standardized curriculum across all schools.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the principles of the NCF-SE?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE promotes a holistic approach, scientific inquiry, and environmental education.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the framework emphasizes flexibility and adaptation to local contexts, not rigid standardization.  The inclusion of a statement suggesting rigid standardization as a distractor adds to the complexity.


**9. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It allows for multiple entry and exit points in the education system.
3.  It utilizes a rigid, inflexible credit system.
4.  It is managed solely by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe NCrF's features. It integrates credits across different educational streams and allows flexibility in entry and exit. Statement 3 is incorrect; the framework is designed to be flexible. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the UGC is involved, the NCrF is a collaborative effort involving multiple bodies.  The incorrect statements regarding rigidity and sole management by the UGC significantly increase the difficulty.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF:**

1.  It focuses on the combined impact of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) related threats on children.
2.  It identifies countries with less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services as facing a "triple threat".
3.  It highlights the high burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under five in several countries.
4.  It exclusively focuses on the impact of climate change on children’s access to WASH services.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the key findings of the report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of the UNICEF report. The report indeed focuses on the combined WASH threats, identifies countries with low WASH access, and highlights the high burden of WASH-related deaths among young children. Statement 4 is incorrect; while climate change is considered, the report's scope is broader than just climate change impacts. The inclusion of a statement that oversimplifies the report's focus raises the challenge for the candidate.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The 1951 Refugee Convention
2.  The 1967 Protocol to the Refugee Convention
3.  The Paris Principles (1993)
4.  The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948)

How many of the above are directly related to the mandate or work of the UNHCR?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) is mandated to protect refugees, asylum-seekers, stateless persons, and other persons of concern.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal frameworks defining who constitutes a refugee and outlining their rights and the obligations of states towards them.  The Paris Principles (1993) establish minimum standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs), which often collaborate with UNHCR on refugee protection.  While the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) is a crucial document establishing fundamental human rights, it's not directly tied to the specific operational mandate of UNHCR in the same way the other three are.  The Convention and Protocol directly guide its actions, and the Paris Principles inform its partnerships. Therefore, only three of the listed documents are directly related to the UNHCR's work.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
2.  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI)
3.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)
4.  Gender Social Norms Index

How many of the above are indices or surveys used to measure aspects of social development and well-being in India (at least partially)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NFHS is a large-scale, nationally representative survey that collects data on various health and family welfare indicators in India.  The UHC SCI, while global in scope, includes data relevant to India's progress toward universal health coverage. The GHI measures hunger and malnutrition, which are significant social issues in India. The Gender Social Norms Index assesses gender inequality, a critical aspect of social development.  Therefore, all four of these are used, at least in part, to measure social development and well-being in India.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The Protection of Human Rights Act (amended in 2019)
2.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016
3.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
4.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

How many of the above Acts directly address the rights and protections of specific vulnerable groups in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2019 amendments to the Protection of Human Rights Act enhanced the National Human Rights Commission's composition and mandate, indirectly impacting the representation of vulnerable groups. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, explicitly protects the rights of people with disabilities. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act targets a specific vulnerable population. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, aims to protect the rights of surrogate mothers.  Thus, all four Acts, in their own ways, address the rights and protections of specific vulnerable groups within the Indian context.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE)
2.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF)
3.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education
4.  The Global Gender Gap Index

How many of the above are directly related to the assessment or improvement of the Indian education system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE guides the curriculum and pedagogy in schools. The NCrF aims to integrate credits across different educational pathways, enhancing flexibility and mobility within the system.  The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at different levels.  While the Global Gender Gap Index touches upon educational attainment, it's not solely focused on the Indian education system's assessment or improvement.  Therefore, only three of the listed items are directly related to assessing or improving the Indian education system.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR)
2.  The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)
3.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
4.  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)

How many of the above are Indian entities or instruments primarily concerned with child welfare or rights?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCPCR is a statutory body in India responsible for protecting child rights. CARA is the nodal body for adoption in India. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, is a key legal framework governing child protection and juvenile justice in India. GANHRI is an international organization, not solely focused on Indian child welfare. Therefore, three of the listed entities are primarily concerned with child welfare or rights in India.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The  National Research Foundation (NRF)
2.  The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs)
3.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
4.  The  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII)

How many of the above are primarily involved in research, data collection, or policy formulation related to global development issues?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NRF is a recently established Indian body that will significantly influence research and innovation. The IAEG-SDGs is a UN body that plays a crucial role in data collection and indicator framework development for the Sustainable Development Goals. IFPRI is a major research institute focused on food security and related policy issues. UNPFII deals with indigenous issues, a major area of global development concern.  Therefore, all four are involved in research, data, or policy related to global development concerns, albeit with different regional and thematic focuses.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The  National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
2.  The  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
3.  The  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs
4.  The  Vimukta Jatis Day

How many of the above are specifically related to initiatives or commemorations concerning the welfare of De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCDNT is a commission specifically created to address the concerns of DNTs. The SEED scheme provides economic empowerment opportunities for DNTs. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship aims to improve educational access for DNTs. Vimukta Jatis Day is a commemoration specifically for DNTs.  Therefore, all four items are directly related to initiatives or commemorations concerning the welfare of DNTs in India.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  The  Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  The  Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
4.  The  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

How many of the above Indian ministries have significant responsibilities related to the welfare of vulnerable populations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on the welfare of tribal communities. The Ministry of Women and Child Development addresses the needs of women and children, particularly vulnerable groups within those categories. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with the welfare of marginalized communities, including DNTs and people with disabilities. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare's mandate naturally encompasses the health and well-being of vulnerable populations.  Therefore, all four ministries have significant responsibilities concerning vulnerable populations in India.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR)
2.  The  National Achievement Survey (NAS)
3.  The  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan
4.  The  Vidya Samiksha Kendras (VSKs)

How many of the above are directly related to data collection, monitoring, or technological infrastructure within the Indian education system?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

NDEAR provides the technological infrastructure for digital education. NAS is a large-scale assessment that generates data on student learning outcomes. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan is a comprehensive program whose implementation is monitored through data systems. VSKs are centers established to collect, analyze, and utilize data for educational planning and monitoring.  Therefore, all four are directly related to data, monitoring, or technological infrastructure in the Indian education system.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  The  Paris Principles
2.  The  Paris Agreement
3.  The  Kyoto Protocol
4.  The  Montreal Protocol

How many of the above agreements or principles are related to environmental protection or climate change but not directly related to human rights?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Paris Principles relate to National Human Rights Institutions. The Paris Agreement is a major international accord on climate change. The Kyoto Protocol is an earlier international treaty on climate change. The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to phase out substances that deplete the ozone layer.  Therefore, only the Paris Agreement and the Kyoto Protocol are directly about environmental protection or climate change without a primary focus on human rights.  The Montreal Protocol also relates to environmental protection but indirectly impacts human health.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol
2.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993
3.  The Protection of Human Rights Act, amended in 2019
4.  The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)

How many of the above are directly related to the legal frameworks or instruments governing the work of international organizations focused on human rights or refugee protection?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal instruments for UNHCR's work in protecting refugees.  The Paris Principles are standards for National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) like GANHRI, guiding their accreditation processes and ensuring their independence. The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act in India aimed to improve the NHRC's functioning, aligning it with international standards.  The UN Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) is a separate and significant international human rights treaty, not directly linked to the operational frameworks of the other mentioned organizations.  Therefore, only three of the listed items are directly related to the legal frameworks of international organizations concerned with human rights or refugee protection.


**2. Consider the following statements about organizations involved in addressing global social issues:**

1.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.

How many of the above statements are factually correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva.  Statement 2 is largely correct; UNHCR operates in many countries, though the precise number may fluctuate slightly.  Statement 3 is incorrect; GANHRI accredits NHRIs every five years, not ten.  Statement 4 is correct; UNPFII comprises 16 experts with three-year terms. Thus, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT)
2.  The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs

4.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe

How many of the above are specifically designed to address the needs and challenges faced by marginalized tribal communities in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NCDNT is a commission dedicated to addressing the issues of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes.  The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship specifically targets the educational needs of DNTs. The SEED scheme focuses on economic empowerment for these communities.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe is an example of a semi-nomadic group, highlighting the population the other initiatives aim to serve.  Therefore, all four elements are directly related to addressing the needs of marginalized tribal groups in India.


**4. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

3.  The NEP proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4.  The NEP advocates for the creation of a National Research Foundation (NRF).

How many of the above are accurate reflections of the NEP 2020's key provisions regarding higher education?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NEP targets a 50% GER by 2035.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NEP allows for 3 or 4-year undergraduate degrees with multiple exit options, not a uniform 6-year structure. Statement 3 is correct; the NEP proposes MERUs to promote multidisciplinary learning.  Statement 4 is correct; the NEP advocates for the establishment of an NRF to boost research.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the NEP's higher education provisions.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to women's empowerment and gender equality:**

1.  The Boeing Sukanya Program
2.  The RESPECT Women Framework
3.  The Gender Social Norms Index

How many of the above are focused on promoting women's participation in STEM fields or measuring global gender inequalities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Boeing Sukanya Program directly supports girls' entry into STEM fields, particularly aviation. The RESPECT Women Framework addresses violence against women, indirectly impacting empowerment. The Gender Social Norms Index and the Global Gender Gap Index both measure gender inequalities across various dimensions.  Therefore, three of the initiatives explicitly focus on STEM or measuring global gender disparities.

3.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023
4.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956

How many of the above are Indian laws or legal provisions specifically addressing violence against women or related issues?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is a comprehensive law addressing domestic violence against women. Section 498A of the IPC criminalizes cruelty by a husband or his relatives. The BNS, 2023, includes provisions related to domestic violence and other forms of violence against women. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, while related to women's safety, primarily focuses on combating sex trafficking.  Therefore, the PWDVA, Section 498A, and the BNS are directly concerned with violence against women.


**7. Consider the following regarding child protection in India:**

1.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
2.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme
3.  The Bachpan Bachao Andolan
4.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016

How many of the above are focused on addressing child labour or providing care and protection to children in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, provides a legal framework for the care and protection of children. The NCLP scheme actively works towards rehabilitating child labourers. Bachpan Bachao Andolan is an NGO specifically dedicated to rescuing and rehabilitating exploited children.  The Child Labour Amendment Act, 2016, strengthens the legal prohibitions against child labour. Thus, all four elements directly address child labour or child protection in India.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended)
2.  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012
3.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS)
4.  The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI)

How many of the above are related to women's health, reproductive rights, or child protection in India, either directly or indirectly?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act directly deals with women's reproductive rights. The POCSO Act protects children from sexual abuse. The NFHS provides data on various health indicators, including women's health. The UHC SCI, while a global index, indirectly reflects the state of women's and children's health within a nation's healthcare system. Therefore, all four are connected to women's health, reproductive rights, or child protection, at least tangentially.


**9. Consider the following about organizations involved in global development and social issues:**

1.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) is headquartered in Rome, Italy.
2.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes the World Youth Report.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PVTGs were first recognized in 1973, not 1975, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961).  Statement 2 is incorrect because one of the criteria for identifying PVTGs is *low* literacy rates, not high.  Statement 3 is correct; Odisha does have the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect key features of the NCF-SE as detailed in the provided text.  The NCF-SE advocates for a move away from the traditional annual exam system to a semester system (1).  It strongly emphasizes the development of practical scientific inquiry skills in addition to theoretical understanding (2). The framework incorporates vocational education, promoting engagement in diverse types of work involving life forms, materials, machines, and human services (3).  Finally, it promotes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with a significant emphasis on Indian languages (4).  Therefore, all four statements are correct.



2. Consider the following statements about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:

1.  The PGI assesses school education performance at both state and district levels.
2.  The index uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The PGI indeed assesses school education performance at state and district levels (1), and the PGI-D report specifically addresses outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety (4). However, statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. The PGI utilizes data from both the UDISE+ and NAS (2), and no states achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment (3).  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.



3. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's impact on higher education:

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the NEP 2020's influence on higher education?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are accurate.  The NEP 2020 indeed targets a GER of at least 50% by 2035 (1), and it promotes the establishment of MERUs to elevate multidisciplinary education standards (3). However, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.  Undergraduate degrees under the NEP have multiple exit options with varying durations (2), and the ABC is designed to digitally store academic credits, not to exchange ideas on educational technology; that role belongs to the NETF (4). Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.



4. Consider the following aspects of the recently released UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:

1.  Institutions younger than 20 years are now eligible to apply for Deemed to be University (DtbU) status.

3.  DtbUs must create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
4.  The regulations supersede the 2019 UGC regulations on DtbUs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of the 2023 UGC regulations on DtbUs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status, a change from the previous 20-year requirement (1).  DtbUs are mandated to create ABC identities for their students (3), and these 2023 regulations explicitly supersede the 2019 regulations (4). However, statement 2 is incorrect; the regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtbU status (2).  Therefore, three statements are correct.



5. Consider the following regarding the UGC Regulations, 2023, facilitating the entry of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) into India:

4.  FHEIs have autonomy in deciding their fee structures.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the stipulations for FHEIs operating in India under the 2023 regulations?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. FHEIs need UGC approval for campus establishment and program offerings (1). Eligibility requires a top 500 global ranking (or exceptional expertise in a specific area) (2).  FHEIs are granted autonomy to set their fee structures (subject to transparency and reasonableness) (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; online or distance learning modes are prohibited for FHEIs under these regulations (3).  Therefore, three statements are correct.



6. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):

1.  It integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of eight educational levels.
3.  It excludes experiential learning in its credit accumulation system.
4.  It aims to enhance flexibility and mobility within the education system.

How many of the above statements accurately depict the NCrF's characteristics?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe the NCrF. The framework integrates credits earned across different educational pathways (1). It divides education into eight levels encompassing school, higher education, and vocational training (2). The NCrF aims to create greater flexibility and mobility within the education system (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning as a means of earning credits (3).  Therefore, three statements are correct.


7. Consider the following statements about the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:

1. The NRF is primarily financed through grants from the central government.
2. The Prime Minister heads the NRF's Governing Board.
3. The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NRF receives funding from various sources, including central government grants (1). The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the Governing Board (2). The Act repealed the SERB Act, 2008, effectively subsuming SERB into the NRF (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NRF's mandate explicitly includes the scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences (4). Therefore, three statements are correct.


8. Consider the following regarding the  recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee on higher education accreditation:

1.  The committee suggested a transition to a binary accreditation system.

3.  The committee proposed a composite assessment system combining program and institutional accreditation.
4.  The committee's recommendations were rejected by the Ministry of Education.


How many of these statements accurately reflect the committee's recommendations and their reception?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the committee's recommendations. The committee advocated for a binary accreditation system (accredited/not accredited) (1). They also proposed a composite assessment system integrating program and institutional accreditation (3).  However, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. The committee did *not* recommend retaining the 8-point NAAC system; instead, they proposed a shift to a binary system (2). The Ministry of Education *accepted* the committee's proposed reforms (4).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


9. Consider the following indicators included in the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (SCI):

1.  Reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately represent components of the UHC SCI. The index tracks indicators related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (1), non-communicable diseases (2), and service capacity and access (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect; agricultural productivity is not a component of the UHC SCI (4). The SCI focuses specifically on health service coverage.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


10. Consider the following about the  "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" released by the UNHCR:

1.  The report indicated a decrease in forced displacement compared to 2021.
2.  The report highlighted that children constitute a significant portion of forcibly displaced people.
3.  Low- and middle-income countries host a majority of the world's refugees.
4.  The report showed a significant increase in stateless individuals.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNHCR report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the UNHCR report's findings. The report highlighted that children comprised a substantial portion (30%) of forcibly displaced individuals (2). It also noted that low- and middle-income countries host the majority (76%) of the world's refugees (3). However, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. The report actually showed an *increase* in forced displacement in 2022 compared to 2021 (1). While there was an increase in stateless individuals, the report did not describe it as *significant* (4).  Therefore, only three statements are correct.




1. Consider the following statements regarding the Gender Social Norms Index:

1. It's published annually by the World Economic Forum.
2. It assesses women's empowerment relative to men across various dimensions.
3.  It includes four dimensions: Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the Gender Social Norms Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Economic Forum. The World Economic Forum publishes the Global Gender Gap Index. Statement 2 is partially correct. The index does assess the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide, but it doesn't directly compare women's status relative to men in a parity index format like the Global Gender Parity Index. Statement 3 is correct. The four dimensions of the Gender Social Norms Index are Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity. Statement 4 is incorrect.  While India's ranking on gender-related indices is indeed around that range, the provided number is inaccurate, and the specific ranking is associated with the Global Gender Gap Index. Therefore, only statements 3 is correct.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UHC SCI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UHC SCI tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes indicators related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health. Statement 2 is also correct. The index measures service capacity and access as key components of universal health coverage.  Statement 3 is correct; India's score did decline as stated. Statement 4 is incorrect. The UHC SCI is jointly released by the WHO and the World Bank, not the IMF.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


3. Consider the following regarding the "Path to Equal" report:

1. It was solely prepared by UN Women.
2.  It introduced the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI).
3. The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) evaluates women's status relative to men.
4. It focuses exclusively on women's economic participation and opportunity.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the "Path to Equal" report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Path to Equal" report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. Statement 2 is correct. The report did introduce the WEI. Statement 3 is correct; the GGPI is a key component of the report. Statement 4 is incorrect. While the report addresses women's empowerment, it's not limited solely to economic participation; it encompasses broader dimensions of human development. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


4. Consider the following statements concerning the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT):

1. It operates under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.
2.  It aims to develop technical terminology in all Indian languages.
3. It was established in 1961 under a Presidential Order.

While the CSTT works on underrepresented languages, it focuses on those in the Eighth Schedule, not the Ninth Schedule. The Ninth Schedule deals with constitutional amendments and land reforms. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


5. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:

1.  The PGI assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2. The index uses only UDISE+ data for its assessment.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, indeed permits only altruistic surrogacy, meaning no monetary compensation beyond medical expenses and insurance is allowed.  It also establishes the NARTSB to oversee the implementation of the Act.  The Act further mandates written consent from the surrogate mother for any abortion, aligning with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  While the initial Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, prohibited the use of donor gametes, subsequent amendments have allowed it under specific medical conditions where at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the amendments to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:**

1.  The 2021 amendment increased accessibility to MTP services for women.
2.  The amendment allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women.
3.  The amendment introduced provisions for termination beyond 24 weeks under specific circumstances.
4.  The amendment completely removed all restrictions on abortion.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the amendments made to the MTP Act, 1971?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1 and 2 only (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act did indeed broaden access to safe and legal abortion services, making it more accessible to women.  It also introduced provisions for termination of pregnancy beyond 20 weeks in specific circumstances, such as rape or foetal abnormalities.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the upper limit was increased, it wasn't extended to 24 weeks for all women.  Statement 4 is also false; the act still has provisions and regulations, it doesn't completely remove restrictions on abortion.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the changes introduced by the 2021 amendment.


**3. Consider the following concerning Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  They were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  Odisha has the lowest number of PVTG communities in India.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and low literacy rates.
4.  PVTGs are exclusively found in the states of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding PVTGs?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs were indeed initially identified as PTGs, reflecting their unique vulnerability.  The criteria for their categorization also correctly include factors like pre-agricultural technology levels and low literacy rates, indicating their socioeconomic backwardness.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; Odisha actually houses the highest number of PVTGs, not the lowest.  Statement 4 is also false; PVTGs are spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, not limited to Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates a minimum of 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities.

Which of the above statements accurately represent provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1 and 4 only (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Act does recognize 21 types of disabilities and mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6 to 18.  However, statement 1 is partially incorrect; while it mandates reservation, the percentage isn't uniformly 5% across all government jobs and educational institutions.  The Act also specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy.  Statement 4 is therefore incorrect.  Only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the Act's major provisions.


**5. Consider the following about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**

1.  It completely eradicated manual scavenging in India.
2.  It prohibits the employment of individuals to handle human waste without protective gear.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the provisions of the Act?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Act does prohibit employing people to handle human waste without proper safety equipment and provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Act aimed to eliminate manual scavenging, but hasn't completely achieved this goal.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate; the act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, not immediate demolition. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates only one board examination for grades 10 and 12.
3.  It promotes multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages.
4.  It eliminates any distinction between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE does propose a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, promotes multilingualism by aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, and advocates for integrating academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, blurring the traditional lines. However, statement 2 is incorrect;  it allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions, retaining the best score.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly represent the NCF-SE's key features.


**7. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. It integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system dividing education into 10 levels.
3.  It allows multiple entry and exit options within the education system.
4. It exclusively focuses on academic credits, ignoring vocational skills.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the NCrF?

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF successfully integrates credits from various educational pathways, including school, higher, and vocational education, aiming for seamless transitions. It also allows multiple entry and exit points, promoting flexibility and lifelong learning. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 10.  Statement 4 is also false; it explicitly includes vocational skills in its credit accumulation and transfer system. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. It is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
3.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment and child mortality.
4.  The Indian government has never raised objections to the GHI methodology.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the GHI?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI does indeed include indicators like undernourishment and child mortality rates to assess hunger levels. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. Statement 2 is also false; while India's GHI score has shown some improvement, it hasn't consistently improved since 2015.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate; the Indian government has frequently raised concerns regarding the GHI's methodology and data sources.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Anganwadi workers receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years.
3.  Anganwadi centers are increasingly incorporating digital technologies for monitoring.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi workers do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, and the system is increasingly using digital tools like the Poshan Tracker app for better monitoring and data collection.  The Anganwadi system is a key component of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making statement 4 incorrect. Statement 2 is also inaccurate; Saksham Anganwadis expand their focus to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. Therefore, only statements 1, 3 are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):**

1. It is monitored by a committee of independent experts.
2.  India has not ratified the UNCRC.
3.  The UNCRC addresses children's rights to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.
4. The UNCRC primarily focuses on legal rights and excludes matters of well-being.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the UNCRC?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1 and 2 only (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNCRC is indeed monitored by a committee of independent experts who review state party reports and address individual complaints.  The convention also includes children's right to a healthy environment as a crucial aspect of their well-being and development.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; India is a state party to the UNCRC, having ratified it.  Statement 4 is also false; the UNCRC encompasses a broad spectrum of rights, including the right to survival, development, protection, and participation, encompassing both legal and well-being aspects.  Only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the UNCRC's key features.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require detailed knowledge of the facts presented.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.
4.  PVTGs were initially designated as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs, Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs. Statement 2 is correct; these are key criteria used to identify PVTGs. Statement 3 is correct as mentioned. Statement 4 is also correct; the renaming to PVTGs happened in 2006.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.  The inclusion of Madhya Pradesh's high ST population as a distractor aims to test the candidate's precise understanding of the distinction between STs and PVTGs.



**2. Consider the following regarding De-notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorized DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a nomadic tribal group from Karnataka.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. Statement 2 is correct; this Act was the basis for the DNT categorization. Statement 3 is partially correct; the Hakki Pikki are semi-nomadic, not strictly nomadic. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are entirely accurate.  The inclusion of the partially true statement about the Hakki Pikki tribe acts as a distractor, testing precise knowledge of the terminology.



**3. Consider the following statements about the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  Reservation under the Act applies to police forces.
4.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; the act mandates a minimum 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%.  Statement 2 is correct. Statement 3 is incorrect; reservation does not apply to police forces. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, only three statements are fully or partially correct.  The close similarity between the correct and incorrect reservation percentages serves as a challenging distractor.



**4. Consider the following initiatives related to manual scavenging:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the construction of insanitary latrines.
2.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers in alternative professions.
3.  The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment.
4.  The NAMASTE scheme promotes the 100% mechanization of sanitation, including sewer cleaning.


Which of the above are aimed at reducing manual scavenging?

(a) 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 2
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act aims to *prevent* the construction of insanitary latrines, not mandate it. Statements 2, 3, and 4 are all correct initiatives aimed at reducing manual scavenging.  The inclusion of the contradictory statement regarding the 2013 Act makes this question difficult, testing the candidate's ability to identify the core purpose of legislation amidst potentially misleading details.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate reflections of the RPwD Act. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act's reservation policy does *not* apply to police forces. The inclusion of the seemingly plausible but false statement regarding police force reservations is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the Act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act bans manual scavenging.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle undecomposed human waste, regardless of employment type (regular or contractual).

The inclusion of the seemingly correct but false statement regarding single sponsoring bodies acts as a powerful distractor.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', challenging accurate recall and analysis.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages for all students, with at least two being Indian languages.
3.  It integrates contributions to knowledge from ancient and contemporary Indian sources into curricular goals.
4. It emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry alongside theoretical knowledge.

**How many of the above statements accurately reflect key highlights of the NCF-SE?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately represent key features of the NCF-SE. The framework does indeed propose a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, a significant departure from the previous system.  Multilingualism is a core tenet, pushing for proficiency in at least three languages, prioritizing Indian languages.  The integration of Indian knowledge systems throughout history is explicitly mentioned in the framework's aims. Finally, the emphasis on scientific inquiry, moving beyond rote learning of theories, is a central pedagogical shift promoted by the NCF-SE.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1. The PGI assesses performance at the state and district levels.
2.  The index uses data from UDISE+ and NAS.
3.  In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4. The PGI-D report focuses solely on the year 2021-22.

**Which of the above statements are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of the PGI. The PGI is designed to assess school education performance at both state and district levels, utilizing data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  Crucially, in the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment, no state or union territory achieved the highest grade of "Daksh."  Statement 4 is incorrect; the PGI-D report combined data from 2020-21 and 2021-22.  This detail makes statement 4 a strong distractor for those who may only partially recall the PGI-D's reporting period.


**3. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of eight levels, with levels 1-4 dedicated to school education.
3.  It allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning.
4.  It is solely focused on higher education pathways.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the NCrF?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the NCrF. The framework explicitly aims to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways, including school, higher education, and vocational training.  Its eight-level structure incorporates school education in levels 1-4.  Experiential learning is recognized as a valid means of accumulating credits. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF is explicitly designed to integrate various educational streams, not just higher education. This makes statement 4 a powerful distractor, as someone might remember the NCrF's connection to higher education but overlook its broader scope.


**4. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs):**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  The 2023 regulations permit clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtBU status.
3.  DtBUs are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for all their students.
4. The primary regulatory authority for DtBUs is the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT).

**Which of the above statements are correct in relation to the 2023 regulations?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The UGC regulations of 2023 significantly lowered the age requirement for DtBU status, allowing institutions younger than 20 years to apply.  The regulations also allow clusters of institutions under different sponsors to apply collectively.  DtBUs are now mandated to create ABC identities for their students. Statement 4 is incorrect;  while NCERT was recently granted DtBU status, it is not the primary regulatory body for all DtBUs. The primary regulatory authority remains the UGC. The inclusion of NCERT in statement 4 is designed to be a sophisticated distractor, playing on the recent news related to NCERT gaining DtBU status.


**5. Consider the following regarding the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1.  The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific requirements.
2. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is static and unchanging.
3.  The MoSPI developed the NIF in 2018.
4. The IAEG-SDGs is responsible for developing the NIF.


**Which of the above statements are correct?**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NIF does include indicators specific to India's context, complementing the global indicators.  The MoSPI (Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) did develop the NIF in 2018.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the GIF is, in fact, evolving.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the IAEG-SDGs (Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators) develops the GIF, not the NIF. The inclusion of IAEG-SDGs and GIF in the statements aims to create confusion by associating similar-sounding acronyms and related concepts, making it a challenging question for an examinee.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government/government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks.
3.  It provides for a special court in every district to expedite cases under the Act.
4.  It excludes police forces from the reservation provisions.

**How many of these statements accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements correctly reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016. The Act does mandate a minimum 5% reservation in higher education for PwDs.  It recognizes a comprehensive list of 21 disabilities, including those caused by acid attacks. The Act also establishes the mechanism for special courts in each district to handle cases efficiently.  Finally, the Act's exclusion of police forces from reservation provisions is also accurate. There are no misleading statements or incorrect facts presented here.  The difficulty lies in recalling the specific details of the Act.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle un-decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.
2.  It makes constructing insanitary latrines an offense.
3.  It mandates the conversion of all insanitary latrines into sanitary ones within a specified time frame.
4. It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe provisions of the PEMSR Act?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the PEMSR Act. The Act clearly defines manual scavengers based on their handling of un-decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.  It criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines.  It also includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial support. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their conversion within a fixed timeframe. The ambiguity about the timeframe is the key distractor in this question, testing precise knowledge of the Act's implementation.



**8. Consider the following in relation to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  They permit surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition.
2.  They allow single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor sperm and their own eggs.
3. They explicitly permit commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances.
4. They mandate a minimum period of surrogacy for all cases.


**Which of the above statements are true regarding the 2024 amendments?**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the 2024 amendments. The amendments allow surrogacy with donor gametes when medically necessary for the intending couple, provided at least one gamete is from the couple.  They also allow single women (widows or divorcees) to use their own eggs and donor sperm for surrogacy. Statement 3 is incorrect; the amendments strictly prohibit commercial surrogacy.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; there is no mandated minimum surrogacy period specified.  The inclusion of commercial surrogacy and a minimum period in statements 3 and 4 serves as a deliberate distractor, testing the examinee's detailed understanding of the nuances of the regulations.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
2.  India's GHI score in 2023 showed a slight improvement compared to 2015.
3.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest hunger levels globally.
4.  India's ranking in the GHI 2023 was above 120.


**Which of the above statements are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The GHI 2023 was indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. India's score did show a marginal improvement compared to 2015.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently register the highest hunger levels.  Statement 4 is incorrect; India's ranking was 111th out of 125, not above 120. The inclusion of a false ranking in statement 4 is a deliberate attempt to test the examinee's precise recall of the data.


**10. Consider the following about the  UNHCR's 2022 Global Trends report on forced displacement:**

1.  The report indicated a 21% increase in forced displacement in 2022 compared to 2021.
2.  Low- and middle-income countries host 76% of the world's refugees.
3.  The report highlighted a significant increase in statelessness in 2022.
4.  Children constituted less than 20% of the forcibly displaced population.


**Which of the statements above are correct according to the report's findings?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The UNHCR report did indeed show a 21% increase in forced displacement in 2022.  Low- and middle-income countries bear the brunt of hosting refugees, accounting for 76% of the global total.  The report also highlighted a concerning increase in stateless individuals. Statement 4 is incorrect; children comprised 30% of the forcibly displaced, significantly more than 20%. The inclusion of an incorrect percentage in statement 4 is designed as a distractor, testing the examinee's precise understanding of the report's data.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) undergoing surrogacy must use their own eggs and donor sperm.
3.  The rules maintain the 2022 prohibition on the use of donor gametes in all surrogacy cases.
4. The rules allow commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals under specific circumstances.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the amended rules.  Statement 1 correctly describes the allowance of donor gametes under specific medical circumstances, ensuring at least one gamete originates from the intending couple. Statement 2 accurately states the requirement for single women to use their own eggs and donor sperm.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the 2022 rule prohibiting donor gametes has been amended. Statement 4 is incorrect; the 2021 Surrogacy Act prohibits commercial surrogacy, and this amendment doesn't alter that.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following aspects of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  The Act defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse.
2.  The Act covers only married women residing in a shared household with their husbands.
3.  A complaint can be filed against the husband's relatives but not against the husband himself.
4.  The Act provides for shelter homes and medical aid for victims.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the PWDVA, 2005?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is entirely accurate. The PWDVA, 2005, indeed provides for shelter homes and medical aid for victims of domestic violence. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act encompasses physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Statement 2 is also incorrect as it covers a wider range of women beyond just married women residing with their husbands; it includes women in various domestic relationships. Statement 3 is incorrect; a complaint can be filed against the husband and his relatives. Therefore, only one statement accurately represents the Act.


**3. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It is a framework solely for higher education, excluding school and vocational education.
2.  It aims to standardize credits earned only through formal educational institutions.
3.  It seeks to integrate credits earned from school, higher education, and vocational training.
4.  It is a framework exclusively for vocational and skill education.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 3 correctly describes the NCrF. The framework explicitly aims to integrate credits from various educational pathways, including school, higher education, and vocational training, ensuring flexibility and mobility between them.  Statement 1 is incorrect as it explicitly includes school and vocational education. Statement 2 is also incorrect; it encompasses both formal and informal learning experiences. Statement 4 is incorrect; it's not limited to vocational education but integrates it with other educational streams. Thus, only one statement is correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act allows the employment of individuals to clean human waste if they use appropriate protective gear.
2.  The Act does not address the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.
3.  The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines.
4.  The Act only applies to the organized sector.


How many of the above statements correctly interpret the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the PEMSR Act.  Statement 1 correctly states that the Act permits cleaning human waste with appropriate safety equipment, differentiating it from the banned practice of manual scavenging. Statement 3 correctly highlights the Act's prohibition on constructing insanitary latrines. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act explicitly addresses the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment, financial aid, and property assistance. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act applies to both organized and unorganized sectors. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**

1.  The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons only in employment.
2.  The Act mandates a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender identity.
3.  The Act does not establish any grievance redressal mechanism.
4.  The Act prohibits separating transgender children from their families without court orders.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4, and partially 1 correctly describe aspects of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Act's provision for self-perceived gender identity certificates. Statement 4 accurately describes the Act's protection of transgender children from family separation without a court order.  Statement 1 is partially correct, as the Act prohibits discrimination across various sectors including education, housing, and healthcare, not only employment.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act establishes a grievance redressal mechanism.  Therefore, three statements are substantially correct.


**6. Consider the following about the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report:**

1. NFHS-5 reported that spousal abuse was most prevalent in Telangana.
2.  NFHS-5 reported that approximately 30% of ever-married women aged 18-49 have experienced spousal violence.
3.  NFHS-5 data was collected in 2018-19.
4. NFHS-5 data covered only urban areas.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect findings or characteristics of the NFHS-5?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 is correct; NFHS-5 did indeed report that approximately 30% of ever-married women aged 18-49 experienced spousal violence.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect, as Karnataka reported higher prevalence than Telangana. Statement 3 is incorrect; the data collection period was 2019-2021. Statement 4 is also incorrect; NFHS-5 covered both rural and urban areas. Therefore, only two statements are largely correct.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the  Ayushman Bharat Yojana:**

1.  It focuses exclusively on tertiary healthcare.
2.  It aims to address health issues at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
3.  It is primarily a digital health initiative.
4. It is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Ayushman Bharat Yojana?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 2 accurately describes the Ayushman Bharat Yojana. The scheme aims for holistic healthcare intervention across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Statement 1 is incorrect; it's not limited to tertiary care. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while it incorporates digital aspects through the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission, it's not solely a digital initiative. Statement 4 is incorrect, it is under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**8. Consider the following about the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  The GHI 2023 ranked India among the top 20 countries with the lowest hunger levels.
2.  The GHI 2023 is published by the World Bank.
3.  The GHI 2023 used data from various sources, including the National Family Health Survey.
4.  The GHI 2023 categorized India's hunger level as "serious".

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the GHI 2023 report regarding India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect the GHI 2023 report on India.  Statement 3 is correct; the GHI uses data from multiple sources, including the NFHS. Statement 4 is also correct; the report categorized India's hunger level as "serious". Statement 1 is incorrect; India was ranked significantly lower than the top 20. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  UNHCR’s ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’:**

1.  The report showed a decrease in forced displacement compared to 2021.
2. Children constituted less than 20% of the forcibly displaced population.
3.  The report highlighted that a significant majority of refugees are hosted by high-income countries.
4. The report noted a rise in forced displacement due to climate and social crises.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNHCR report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 accurately reflects the UNHCR report. The report did indeed show a rise in forced displacement due to climate and social crises.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the report showed an increase in forced displacement. Statement 2 is incorrect; children constituted a much higher percentage (30%). Statement 3 is incorrect; low- and middle-income countries host the majority of refugees. Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**10. Consider the following about the  Paris Principles:**

1. They are guidelines for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).
2. They were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993.
3. They are primarily concerned with the promotion of economic development.
4.  They are not binding on any nation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Paris Principles?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the Paris Principles. Statement 1 is correct; the principles serve as guidelines for accrediting NHRIs. Statement 2 is also correct; they were adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1993. Statement 3 is incorrect; while they indirectly relate to social and economic well-being through human rights, their primary focus is on human rights protection and promotion. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while not legally binding in the same way as treaties, they serve as widely accepted standards for NHRIs. Therefore, only two statements are fully correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTGs.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  PVTGs were initially recognized as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973.
5.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All five statements are factually accurate. Madhya Pradesh does indeed have the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for PVTG welfare. Odisha currently houses the largest number of PVTGs.  The PVTGs were initially recognized as PTGs in 1973, and the criteria for their identification include a pre-agricultural level of technology and either a declining or stagnant population, among other socio-economic factors.


**2. Consider the following features related to Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Hakki Pikki tribe of Karnataka is a semi-nomadic group.
4.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.
5.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs, only those previously labeled as criminal tribes under the British regime.  The rest of the statements (2, 3, 4, and 5) are accurate reflections of the historical context, characteristics, and current situation of DNTs in India. The Renke Commission's estimation, while large, is a commonly cited figure, and the celebration of Vimukta Jatis Day is a well-known event within the DNT community.



**3. Consider the following regarding government initiatives for DNT welfare:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a state-wise list of DNT castes.
2.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme constructs hostels solely for DNT boys.
3.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) provides health insurance and exam coaching.
4.  A Development and Welfare Board for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities was formed in 2019.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of government initiatives aimed at improving the welfare of DNTs. The NCDNT is indeed tasked with creating a state-wise list, SEED offers both health insurance and competitive exam coaching, and the Development and Welfare Board was established in 2019. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme constructs hostels for both DNT boys and girls.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3.  Free education is guaranteed for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18.
4.  The Act excludes police forces from reservation policies for PwDs.
5.  A "person with benchmark disability" has at least 40% of a specified disability.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately reflect provisions within the RPwD Act.  The Act does stipulate at least 4% reservation in government jobs (not 5%),  it includes acid attack victims among the 21 recognized disabilities, free education is provided as stated, police forces are indeed excluded from reservation, and the definition of "benchmark disability" is accurately given.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  PEMSR defines manual scavengers as those who handle undecomposed human waste without protective gear.
2.  The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines.
3.  PEMSR mandates the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial aid.
4.  Local authorities are responsible for identifying manual scavengers within their jurisdictions.
5.  Safal karamcharis are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect key aspects of the PEMSR Act.  The act does define manual scavengers as those handling human waste, even if employed by private entities,  makes constructing insanitary latrines an offense, mandates rehabilitation efforts, and assigns responsibility for identification to local authorities. However, statement 5 is incorrect; Safal karamcharis (sweepers and cleaning workers) are *included* in the definition of manual scavengers if they are involved in handling human waste without proper safety equipment.


**6. Consider the following about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  NCF-SE emphasizes capacities for scientific inquiry alongside theoretical knowledge.
2.  Environmental education is integrated only at the secondary stage.
3.  NCF-SE introduces interdisciplinary areas of study as a separate subject at the secondary stage.
4.  NCF-SE mandates a specific number of learning hours per year.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 correctly represent aspects of NCF-SE. The framework promotes scientific inquiry and integrates interdisciplinary studies, particularly at the secondary level. However, statement 2 is incorrect; environmental education is integrated throughout all stages of schooling, culminating in a dedicated area of study at the secondary level.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the NCF-SE promotes a holistic approach to education, it does not mandate a specific number of learning hours per year.  The number of hours is a matter of implementation by individual educational institutions.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  PGI assesses performance at both state and district levels.
2.  PGI uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
3.  PGI classifies states/UTs into ten grades.
4.  In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
5.  PGI-D focuses exclusively on student test scores.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. PGI assesses performance at both state and district levels, uses a grading system with ten grades, and in the 2021-22 assessment, no entity achieved the highest grade.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; PGI uses data from both UDISE+ and NAS.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; PGI-D considers various factors beyond just student test scores, including classroom transactions and school safety.


**8. Consider the following regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs):**

1.  Institutions less than 20 years old are eligible to apply for DtbU status under the 2023 regulations.
2.  A cluster of institutions under multiple sponsors can apply for DtbU status.
3.  DtbUs can start new courses without any external approvals.
4.  The UGC Act of 1956 provides the legal basis for declaring institutions as DtbUs.
5.  DtbUs must create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The 2023 regulations lowered the age requirement for DtbU applications, allow clusters of institutions to apply, the UGC Act provides the legal framework, and ABC identity creation is mandatory.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; DtbUs require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils before starting new courses.


**9. Consider the following about the UGC regulations for Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India:**

1.  FHEIs need UGC approval to establish campuses in India.
2.  FHEIs must be ranked among the top 500 globally to be eligible.
3.  FHEIs can offer online and distance learning programs.
4.  FHEIs have autonomy in deciding their fee structure.
5.  FHEIs are exempt from Indian laws regarding foreign donations.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 4, and 2 are accurate. FHEIs require UGC approval for campus establishment, have autonomy in setting fees, and generally need to be within the top 500 global rankings (though exceptions may exist for institutions with exceptional expertise). However, statement 3 is incorrect; online and distance learning programs are generally not permitted.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; FHEIs are *not* exempt from Indian laws related to foreign donations; they require prior permission.


**10. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  NCrF uses a credit system with 8 levels.
3.  NCrF only recognizes credits earned through formal academic programs.
4.  NCrF mandates a specific number of notional learning hours per year.
5.  NCrF aims to make education more holistic through multi-disciplinary approaches.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurate. NCrF integrates various educational pathways, uses an 8-level credit system, specifies notional learning hours (though the exact number might vary in implementation), and promotes a holistic multi-disciplinary approach. Statement 3 is incorrect; NCrF also recognizes credits earned through vocational training and experiential learning.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding,  with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
3.  It integrates contributions to knowledge by Indians from ancient to contemporary times into the curriculum.
4.  It strictly separates academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.

**Which of the statements above are correct?**

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed introduces a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for school education, replacing the older system.  Statement 1 is correct.  The framework also emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages. Statement 2 is correct.  Furthermore, the NCF-SE explicitly integrates contributions from Indian scholars across history into the curriculum, reflecting a focus on India's rich intellectual heritage. Statement 3 is correct. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE explicitly rejects rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, promoting flexibility and integration.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  It establishes the NRF to provide strategic direction for research in various fields, including humanities and social sciences.
2.  The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3.  The Act repeals the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008 and integrates SERB into the NRF.
4.  The NRF is primarily funded through international collaborations and private sector investments.

**How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, does indeed establish the NRF to guide research across diverse fields, encompassing natural sciences, engineering, and the intersection of humanities and social sciences with scientific and technological advancements. Statement 1 is correct. The Act also designates the Prime Minister as the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board. Statement 2 is correct.  Crucially, the Act repeals the SERB Act of 2008 and incorporates SERB's functions into the newly formed NRF. Statement 3 is correct. However, statement 4 is inaccurate. While the NRF will receive funds from various sources, its primary funding mechanism is through grants and loans from the central government,  along with donations and investment income. International collaborations and private sector investment are supplementary, not the primary source. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately describe the Act's features.


**3. Consider the following aspects of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  It excludes police forces from the reservation provisions for PwDs.
4.  It establishes special courts in every district solely for cases under the Act.

**How many of the above statements correctly represent provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, does stipulate a minimum of 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions. Statement 1 is correct. The Act also acknowledges a comprehensive list of 21 disabilities, encompassing intellectual disabilities and individuals affected by acid attacks. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act also specifically excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police) from the reservation policy for PwDs. Statement 3 is correct.  However, statement 4 is partially incorrect. While the Act emphasizes faster adjudication of cases, it doesn't mandate a dedicated special court in *every* district exclusively for cases under the RPwD Act.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education using NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF.
2.  It establishes a system where credits can be earned through experiential learning and industry experience.
3.  It mandates a uniform, rigid curriculum across all levels of education to ensure credit transferability.
4.  It utilizes the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) to digitally store earned credits.

**Which of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the National Credit Framework?**

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF successfully integrates credits earned from various educational pathways (school, higher, and vocational education) using existing frameworks like NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF. Statement 1 is correct.  The framework also allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning and relevant industry experience. Statement 2 is correct. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF promotes flexibility and does not enforce a rigid, uniform curriculum. The goal is to facilitate credit transfer, not to standardize all learning experiences.  The NCrF also leverages the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for the digital storage and management of earned credits. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately represent the NCrF's features.



**5. Consider the following about the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  It assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  It uses data from UDISE+ and NAS for its assessment.
3.  In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), all states/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4.  PGI-D focuses on outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety.


**Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the Performance Grading Index?**

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI does indeed assess the performance of school education systems at both state and district levels. Statement 1 is correct.  It relies on data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) for its evaluations. Statement 2 is correct. Statement 3 is incorrect;  in PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").  The PGI-D report specifically focuses on various aspects, including educational outcomes, the effectiveness of classroom teaching, and ensuring school safety. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the PGI.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  It shows little progress in reducing global hunger since 2015.
2.  India's GHI score improved significantly compared to 2015.
3. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa show the highest hunger levels.
4. The report uses a methodology universally accepted by all nations.

**How many of the above statements correctly reflect findings from the GHI 2023 report?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2023 report indeed indicates minimal progress in reducing global hunger since 2015, highlighting the impact of various crises. Statement 1 is correct.  While India's GHI score did improve slightly, the improvement was not significant. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report identifies South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the most severe hunger levels. Statement 3 is correct. Statement 4 is incorrect; the report's methodology has faced criticism and objections from some nations, including India, due to concerns about data sources and sample sizes.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) accurately reflect the GHI 2023 report's findings.


**7. Consider the following statements about the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):**

1.  It aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in all villages.
2.  An ODF Plus village sustains its ODF status and implements solid or liquid waste management.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village meets stringent criteria including visual cleanliness and IEC messaging.
4. By September 2023, less than 50% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status.


**How many of these statements accurately describe the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its ODF Plus initiatives?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) indeed aims to achieve ODF status across all villages. Statement 1 is correct.  An ODF Plus village maintains its ODF status while integrating either solid or liquid waste management systems. Statement 2 is correct. An ODF Plus Model village goes further, adhering to stricter standards, including visual cleanliness and the display of IEC (Information, Education, and Communication) messages. Statement 3 is correct.  Statement 4 is incorrect;  a significantly higher percentage (75%) of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status by September 2023 according to the provided text. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately reflect the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its ODF Plus initiatives.


**8. Consider the following concerning the  UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023:**

1.  It projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous nation by mid-2023.
2.  It highlights India's young population, with a significant portion in the 15-64 age group.
3.  It shows India's total fertility rate has increased substantially since 2015-16.
4. It projects a significant increase in India's elderly population by 2050.

**How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNFPA report?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The UNFPA report accurately projects India to surpass China in population by mid-2023. Statement 1 is correct.  The report also highlights the relatively young demographic profile of India's population, with a substantial portion within the working-age group (15-64 years). Statement 2 is correct.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The report indicates a *decrease* in India's total fertility rate since 2015-16, not an increase. While the report does project changes in India's age structure, it doesn't specifically highlight a *significant* increase in the elderly population by 2050; the increase is projected to be gradual. Statement 4 is therefore considered incorrect in the context of "significant" increase. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) accurately reflect the UNFPA report's key findings.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:**

1.  They supersede the 2019 regulations.
2.  They allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed-to-be-University status.
3.  They prohibit Deemed-to-be-Universities from starting new courses without prior approval.
4.  They mandate Deemed-to-be-Universities to create ABC identities for their students.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe the salient features of the 2023 UGC regulations?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 UGC regulations indeed supersede the 2019 regulations, aiming for improvements in higher education. Statement 1 is correct.  A key change is that institutions younger than 20 years are now eligible to apply for Deemed-to-be-University status, unlike the previous regulations. Statement 2 is correct. While Deemed-to-be-Universities require approval for new courses, this approval process is not a complete prohibition, and involves the institution's Executive Council and other relevant bodies. Statement 3 is therefore partially incorrect.  The regulations mandate the creation of ABC identities and the uploading of credit scores for students in digital lockers. Statement 4 is correct.  Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect aspects of the 2023 UGC regulations, though statement 3 requires careful interpretation.


**10. Consider the following statements about the  UNHCR's Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:**

1.  It reported over 100 million people forcibly displaced worldwide in 2022.
2.  It indicated that forced migration due to social and climate crises increased in 2022 compared to 2021.
3.  It highlighted that a majority of the world's refugees are hosted by high-income countries.
4.  It documented a significant increase in stateless individuals in 2022.


**How many of the above statements accurately represent the report's key findings?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR report documented a staggering number of forcibly displaced people (over 100 million) worldwide in 2022. Statement 1 is correct.  It showed a notable increase in forced migration due to social and climate factors in 2022 compared to the previous year. Statement 2 is correct.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The report actually highlights that a significant majority of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries.  The report also showed a slight increase (2%) in the number of stateless individuals in 2022. Statement 4 is correct.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) accurately reflect the report's key findings.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1. Madhya Pradesh has the largest number of PVTGs in India.
2. PVTGs were initially recognized as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology and a declining or stagnant population.
4. Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of Scheduled Tribes (STs), Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 2 is correct; PVTGs were indeed first recognized as PTGs in 1973 based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission. Statement 3 is also correct, as these are among the criteria used to identify PVTGs.  Statement 4 is correct; Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs. Therefore, only two statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related statistics on tribal populations.  Understanding the nuances of PVTG categorization within the larger context of ST populations is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following regarding De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that nearly 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic communities.
4.  Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. Statement 3 is correct; the Renke Commission estimated the combined population of DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic groups to be around 15 crore. Statement 4 is also correct; the Hakki Pikki Tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.  Therefore, three statements are correct. This question assesses factual knowledge about DNTs, their history, and related commissions, testing recall and analysis of social groups.


**3. Consider the following measures undertaken for Tribal welfare:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2.  International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.
3.  The Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and the Kamar and Baiga tribes in Chhattisgarh were recently granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
4. Teams of tribals should be trained in administration and development, according to policy recommendations.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare initiatives. August 9th is indeed International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples.  The Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes have received habitat rights as stated. Policy recommendations emphasize training tribal communities in administration and development. This question tests factual recall of key government initiatives and policy recommendations concerning tribal welfare.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  Reservation under the Act is applicable to all police forces in India.
4. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities is under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Act does mandate a minimum of 5% reservation in higher education and recognizes 21 types of disabilities. Statement 3 is incorrect; reservation is not applicable to certain police forces. Statement 4 is correct; the Office of the Chief Commissioner falls under the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment. This question tests knowledge of the RPwD Act, 2016, focusing on specific provisions related to reservation, the types of disabilities recognized, and the administrative structure.  The inclusion of statement 3 as a distractor makes the question challenging.



**5. Consider the following about Manual Scavenging in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste, regardless of protective gear use.
3.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.
4. Safal karamcharis are not considered manual scavengers.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines. Statement 2 is partially correct; the act does define manual scavengers as those handling undecomposed human waste but adds an exception for those using protective gear. Statement 3 is correct; the National Policy focuses on mechanized sanitation and worker safety. Statement 4 is incorrect; Safal karamcharis are considered manual scavengers.  Therefore, only three statements are fully correct. This question requires careful analysis of the legal definition of manual scavenging and related government policies, testing conceptual understanding and interpretation of legislation.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling.
2.  The policy aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 50% by 2035.
3.  NEP 2020 recommends the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4.  The National Assessment Centre, PARAKH, is established under NEP 2020.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. NEP 2020 does propose the 5+3+3+4 structure, aims for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, and recommends MERUs. Statement 4 is incorrect; while PARAKH is a significant assessment initiative, it's not explicitly established *under* NEP 2020 but rather in response to its recommendations. This question tests understanding of the key features of NEP 2020 concerning school and higher education structures and aims.  The nuanced distinction in statement 4 creates a challenging distractor.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board.
2.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).

4. The NRF is modeled on the US National Science Foundation (NSF).


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) All four
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Prime Minister heads the Governing Board, the NRF absorbs SERB, and the NRF's structure is indeed modeled on the NSF. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Department of Science and Technology (DST), not the Department of Biotechnology, is the administrative department. This question tests detailed knowledge of the NRF Act, including its organizational structure, funding mechanisms, and the relationship with other research bodies.  The incorrect statement provides a strong distractor.



**8. Consider the following organizations:**

1.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
2.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)
4.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

Which of the above organizations released reports related to global hunger or food security in recent years?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WFP (3) regularly releases reports on the global food crisis, and IFPRI (4) publishes the Global Food Policy Report.  UNFPA (1) focuses on population issues, and UNDESA (2) releases reports on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which include aspects of hunger but are not solely focused on it. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their areas of expertise, requiring analysis of their respective mandates and publications. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent organizations with overlapping but distinct areas of concern.


**9. Consider the following initiatives related to child welfare in India:**

1.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme
2.  Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme
3.  PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal
4.  Poshan Abhiyaan

How many of the above initiatives directly address child labour or its consequences?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCLP Scheme (1) and the PENCiL Portal (3) directly address child labour through rehabilitation and enforcement.  ICDS (2) and Poshan Abhiyaan (4) are broader initiatives focused on child development and nutrition, which indirectly impact child labour by improving the overall well-being of children, making them less vulnerable to exploitation. This question tests the understanding of various government schemes and their specific focus areas, demanding application of knowledge to categorize initiatives based on their primary objectives. The inclusion of related but not directly relevant schemes makes the question more challenging.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
2.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI ranking has consistently improved over the years.
4. The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The GHI is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, and it uses the mentioned indicators. The Indian government has voiced concerns regarding the GHI methodology. Statement 3 is incorrect; while there might have been some fluctuations, India's GHI ranking hasn't shown consistent improvement. This question tests knowledge of the GHI, its methodology, and the Indian government's position on it. The inclusion of a partially true statement (3) makes the question difficult.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and require precise factual recall, analysis, and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
3.  It emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry, alongside theoretical knowledge.
4.  It advocates for hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the Secondary Stage.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect key features of the NCF-SE.  The framework does indeed propose a new age-based structure for schooling, emphasizing multilingualism (at least three languages, with a preference for Indian languages), and the importance of developing practical scientific inquiry skills alongside theoretical knowledge. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE explicitly moves *away* from hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the Secondary Stage, promoting flexibility and choice.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  The PGI assesses school education system performance at the State and District levels.
2.  The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 utilized data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021.
3.  In PGI 2.0, all States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh).
4.  PGI-D focuses solely on quantitative data, neglecting qualitative aspects like classroom transactions.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the PGI's purpose and data sources. The PGI does assess performance at both State and District levels, and the 2021-22 iteration used the specified data sets. However, statement 3 is false; no States/UTs achieved the highest grade in PGI 2.0. Statement 4 is also incorrect; PGI-D considers qualitative aspects like effective classroom transactions and school safety, not solely quantitative data.


**3. Consider the following about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It is a framework solely for higher education, excluding school and vocational education.
2.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
3.  It utilizes the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) but excludes NSQF and NSEQF.
4.  It aims to restrict flexibility and mobility between different educational pathways.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 2 correctly describes the NCrF.  The framework is explicitly designed to integrate credits from various educational sectors (school, higher education, vocational/skill education). Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The NCrF encompasses all three mentioned qualification frameworks (NHEQF, NSQF, NSEQF) and aims to *increase* flexibility and mobility between different educational pathways, not restrict them.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  It defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  It covers only married women residing with their husbands.
3.  It provides for civil remedies but not criminal ones.
4.  It allows complaints to be filed against relatives of the husband or male partner.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is correct. The PWDVA does allow complaints against relatives of the husband or male partner.  Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The act defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing various forms of abuse (physical, verbal, emotional, economic, sexual); it covers a wider range of women than just married women living with their husbands; and while it primarily provides civil remedies, it can interact with and influence criminal proceedings under other laws.


**5. Consider the following regarding the  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF):**

1. The NIRF ranking is solely based on the perception of the institutions.
2.  The NIRF uses parameters like Teaching, Learning and Resources, and Research and Professional Practice.
3.  The 2023 edition integrated the ARIIA ranking into the NIRF ranking.
4.  The NIRF ranking is conducted by the National Medical Commission (NMC).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The NIRF does indeed utilize comprehensive parameters to assess institutions, including those mentioned, and the 2023 edition integrated the ARIIA ranking. However, statement 1 is incorrect; NIRF ranking is not solely based on perception; it includes several other objective parameters. Statement 4 is also false; NIRF ranking is conducted by the Ministry of Education, not the NMC.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the  Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  The GHI 2023 ranked India among the countries with the highest hunger levels.
3.  The GHI methodology has faced objections due to issues like sample size and data sources.
4.  The GHI solely focuses on quantitative data, neglecting qualitative factors related to food security.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The GHI 2023 did indeed place India in a concerning category, and its methodology has faced criticism regarding sample size and data sources.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the GHI primarily uses quantitative data, it implicitly reflects qualitative aspects of food security.



**7. Consider the following about the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):**

1. It aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in all villages.
2.  An ODF Plus village has sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village requires arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
4. The Swachh Bharat Mission is primarily focused on urban areas.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and its ODF Plus criteria. The mission aims for ODF status in all villages; ODF Plus requires sustained ODF status plus either solid or liquid waste management; and ODF Plus Model villages need both.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Swachh Bharat Mission has both Grameen (rural) and Urban components.


**8. Consider the following regarding the  National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan:**

1. It was launched in 2017 to monitor nutrition-related interventions across ministries.
2.  It aims to reduce stunting only in urban areas.
3.  It focuses solely on children's nutrition, excluding pregnant women and mothers.
4.  It utilizes the Anganwadi system as a key component of its implementation.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. The POSHAN Abhiyan was indeed launched in 2017 to improve nutrition-related interventions across ministries. Statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The mission targets both rural and urban areas; it focuses on the nutrition of pregnant women, mothers, and children; and it heavily relies on the Anganwadi system for implementation.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1. It recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
2.  It mandates a minimum of 5% reservation in all government jobs for PwDs.
3.  It provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to the age of 18.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  Madhya Pradesh does have the largest number of STs, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry, and PVTGs were originally PTGs. Statement 4 is incorrect; Odisha has a *significant* number of PVTGs (13), not the fewest.  This false statement acts as a significant distractor, requiring detailed knowledge of PVTG distribution.


**6. Consider the following regarding De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India:**

1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 led to the 'notification' of DNTs as 'born criminals'.
3. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a state-wise list of DNT castes.

(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The Criminal Tribes Act is the historical basis for DNT categorization, and the NCDNT prepares the state-wise lists. Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Hakki Pikki tribe is *semi-nomadic*, not nomadic.  These incorrect statements make the question more challenging.


**7. Consider the following initiatives related to manual scavenging:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prohibits the employment of manual scavengers.
2. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers.
3. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment.
4.  The NAMASTE scheme focuses solely on the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.

How many of the above statements correctly describe initiatives to address manual scavenging?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct features of the 2016 Act.  The Act provides for reservations in higher education, recognizes multiple disabilities, and offers free education to eligible children.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act specifically *excludes* police forces from the reservation mandate. This detail makes the question more challenging for candidates who may have a general understanding but lack precise knowledge.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct descriptions of the Global Gender Gap Index.  It is published by the WEF, uses the four stated parameters, and covers economic, social, and political aspects. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's ranking is typically *not* within the top 20, which serves as a crucial distractor.



**10. Consider the following regarding the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1. The NIF includes indicators aligned with the SDGs global indicators and India-specific indicators.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. The NIF incorporates global and India-specific indicators, and MoSPI developed it. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF, like the GIF, is *evolving*. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NIF, in its 2023 version, has *more* indicators than the GIF.  These contrasting statements increase the question's difficulty.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI):**

1.  PGI assesses school education system performance at State and District levels.
2.  The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 utilized UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021 data.
3.  In PGI 2.0, no State/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').
4.  PGI-D reports focus on school outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the Performance Grading Index (PGI) and its methodology.  The PGI is designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels.  The 2021-22 iteration of PGI specifically used data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  A key finding of PGI 2.0 was that no state or union territory reached the highest grade ('Daksh'). Finally, the District-level PGI (PGI-D) reports concentrate on evaluating educational outcomes, the effectiveness of classroom teaching, and the safety of schools.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education:**

(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The NEP 2020 indeed includes all five mentioned features. The policy sets an ambitious goal of achieving a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  It introduces a flexible undergraduate degree structure with multiple exit points, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, Bachelor's degrees, and Honours degrees depending on their progress and goals.  The policy also plans for the establishment of MERUs to promote multidisciplinary education and research.  The NRF is a key component of NEP 2020, aiming to significantly enhance research and innovation across the country.  Finally, the policy explicitly encourages the entry of top international universities to open campuses in India, promoting internationalization of higher education.  Therefore, all five features are correctly described as part of NEP 2020's higher education plans.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The 2023 regulations significantly altered the criteria for DtBU status.  Statement 1 is correct because the new regulations lowered the age requirement, enabling institutions younger than 20 years to apply.  Statement 2 is also correct as the 2023 regulations permit clusters of institutions under different sponsors to seek DtBU status. Statement 3 is true; DtBUs require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory bodies for new courses.  Finally, Statement 4 is accurate; the regulations mandate DtBUs to create ABC identities and upload student credit scores.  Therefore, all four statements are correct representations of the 2023 regulations.


**4. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  NCrF aims to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
2.  NCrF encompasses the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF qualification frameworks.
3.  NCrF mandates a fixed 1200 Notional Learning Hours per year across all educational levels.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The NCrF is a comprehensive framework designed to integrate learning across various educational pathways. Statement 1 is correct: its primary goal is to create a system where credits earned in school, higher education, and vocational training are mutually recognized and transferable. Statement 2 is also correct:  NCrF integrates the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF). Statement 3 is accurate:  the framework does establish a standard of 1200 notional learning hours per year across all levels. Statement 4 is true; the NCrF facilitates multiple entry and exit points, allowing for flexibility in educational journeys.  Thus, all four statements accurately represent elements of the NCrF.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1.  It is released annually by the World Economic Forum.
2.  It uses four parameters: Economic Participation, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.
3.  India's 2023 ranking was below the 100th position.
4.  The index measures gender parity in various aspects of human development.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding the Global Gender Gap Index?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI). The World Economic Forum publishes this index annually, using four key parameters to assess gender equality across countries. Statement 3 is also correct; India's 2023 ranking was indeed below the 100th position. However, statement 4 is slightly misleading. While the GGGI does indirectly reflect gender parity in human development, it is not its primary focus; its direct focus is on gender gaps in the four specific parameters, rather than a holistic measure of gender parity across all aspects of human development.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

4.  The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) frames the GIF.

How many of these statements correctly describe the NIF for SDGs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the NIF for SDGs. The NIF is designed to align with the global indicators but also incorporates indicators relevant to India's specific context.  The 2023 version of the NIF contains a substantial number of indicators (over 200).  States and Union Territories develop their own SIFs following guidelines provided by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI). Finally, the IAEG-SDGs is the body responsible for developing the GIF, which serves as a global standard for measuring progress on the SDGs. Thus, all four statements are correct descriptions of the NIF.


**7. Consider the following about the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It completely bans the practice of manual scavenging.
2.  It prescribes punishment for employing individuals as manual scavengers.
3.  It mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.
4.  It outlines a rehabilitation program for manual scavengers.

How many of the above statements correctly describe provisions within the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) All four
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act aims to eradicate manual scavenging and rehabilitate those affected. Statement 1 is correct: the Act explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals for manual scavenging. Statement 2 is also correct: it defines penalties for those employing individuals in this practice. Statement 3 is accurate: the Act mandates the elimination of insanitary latrines, a key source of manual scavenging work. Statement 4 is true:  it includes provisions for the rehabilitation and provision of alternative employment opportunities for manual scavengers.  Therefore, all four statements correctly represent key aspects of the PEMSR Act.


**8. Consider the following about the  Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  It's a part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  It aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children under six, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are factually accurate. Madhya Pradesh does indeed have the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for PVTGs. Odisha currently houses the largest number of PVTGs.  The criteria used to identify PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology and a declining or stagnant population. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the overlapping nature of tribal groups across state boundaries.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 unjustly labeled DNTs as "born criminals." The Renke Commission estimated a large population belonging to these groups. August 31st is indeed celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a well-known example of a semi-nomadic group. Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the correct option.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act hasn't eradicated manual scavenging, though it aims to do so.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act exempts those using appropriate protective gear.  The Act does stipulate penalties for violations, mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines, and includes a rehabilitation scheme.

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Statement 4 is also incorrect; there are other UN bodies dealing with indigenous issues.  The UNPFII does have 16 experts, eight nominated by governments and eight by indigenous organizations.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. AWWs receive a fixed honorarium, the Poshan Tracker app aids in monitoring, and  AWWs and AWHs have insurance coverage under PMJJBY.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions, requiring at least one gamete from the intending couple.  This is a significant departure from the previous prohibition on donor gametes.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, primarily focuses on altruistic surrogacy and prohibits commercial surrogacy. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate is biologically related to the child, is generally not permitted under the current legal framework due to ethical and potential exploitation concerns.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 1 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances (like rape, foetal abnormalities, etc.).  The 24-week limit is not a universally applicable limit. Statement 2 is correct. The 2021 amendment removed some restrictions based on marital status, expanding access to abortion services. Statement 3 is correct. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, contains provisions related to causing miscarriage, reflecting the legal framework surrounding abortion. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect.

1.  The Act mandates the constitution of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in all workplaces with 10 or more employees.
2.  The ICC's inquiry must be completed within 60 days of receiving the complaint.
3.  The Act allows for monetary settlements to resolve sexual harassment complaints through conciliation.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The Act mandates the formation of an ICC in workplaces with 10 or more employees.  Smaller workplaces may utilize a Local Committee. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act stipulates that the ICC must complete its inquiry within 90 days, not 60 days.  This timeframe is crucial for ensuring timely redressal. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation in sexual harassment cases. This provision aims to prevent the trivialization of serious offenses and protect the rights of the aggrieved woman.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The draft policy emphasizes equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources, focusing on those most in need. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the policy promotes menstrual hygiene, it doesn't mandate paid menstrual leave. Paid menstrual leave is a separate policy consideration adopted by some countries, notably Spain. Statement 3 is correct. The policy aims to create a stigma-free environment surrounding menstruation, recognizing it as a natural biological process.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**5. Consider the following concerning Child Labour in India:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The 2016 Amendment Act prohibits child labour below the age of 14 in all forms of employment. Statement 2 is incorrect. While NCLP aims to rehabilitate child labourers, its primary focus is not on financial assistance to families. It involves rescuing children, providing education and vocational training, and supporting their reintegration into mainstream society. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**6. Consider the following related to Child Adoption in India:**

1.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs all adoptions in India, regardless of religious affiliation.
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, outlines procedures for inter-country adoptions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 3

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a "child" as a person below 18 years of age.  The age of 16-18 was relevant to certain provisions regarding trying juveniles as adults. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act categorizes offenses based on the severity of punishment, influencing the juvenile justice process. Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment did *not* remove the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous crimes; it retained this provision with some modifications to the assessment process. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the following statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 only

The NNMC Act does aim to address the shortage of nursing colleges, especially in rural areas. Statement 2 is incorrect; while WFME recognition benefits Indian medical colleges, it is not mandatory. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NNMC Act repeals the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, not the Indian Medical Council Act. Therefore, three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs are centrally recognized special categories from among Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  The Bharia PVTG is found only in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PVTGs are indeed centrally recognized special categories within the larger group of Scheduled Tribes.  Statement 2 is also correct; these are key criteria used for identifying PVTGs, reflecting their vulnerability and unique circumstances. Statement 3 is accurate; Odisha does house the largest number of PVTGs. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific characteristics and distribution of PVTGs in India.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
2.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
3.  The Act provides for a special court in every district for faster adjudication of cases.
4.  The Act's reservation policy applies to all police forces in India.


Which of the above statements is/are NOT correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act.  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The RPwD Act's reservation policy does *not* apply to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs). This exclusion is a significant detail often overlooked, making this a challenging question for factual recall and understanding of the Act's limitations. The other options are incorrect because they include at least one accurate statement.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify exceptions within the law.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act completely prevents the employment of manual scavengers.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits.
3.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines immediately upon its enactment.
4.  The Act includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PEMSR Act aims to eliminate manual scavenging, it doesn't completely prevent it in all circumstances.  Statement 2 is correct; this is a key definition within the Act. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, not immediately. Statement 4 is correct; rehabilitation is a crucial component of the Act. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, making option (c) the answer.  This question tests the nuanced understanding of the legislation, its limitations, and its provisions for rehabilitation.  It demands careful reading and analysis of the Act's details.



**4. Consider the following concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least five languages.
3.  The NCF-SE advocates for hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.
4.  The NCF-SE emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the 5+3+3+4 structure is a core feature of the NCF-SE. Statement 2 is incorrect; the framework promotes proficiency in at least *three* languages, not five.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; it advocates for *no* hard separations between academic and vocational subjects. Statement 4 is correct; scientific inquiry is a key emphasis.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct. This question tests the understanding of the NCF-SE's core principles and its approach to language learning and subject integration.  It requires careful attention to detail and differentiation between similar concepts.



**5. Consider the following statements related to the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  The NCrF aims to integrate credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
2.  The NCrF encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) and the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).
3.  The NCrF mandates a uniform credit system across all levels of education with no flexibility for diverse learning pathways.
4. The NCrF proposes a rigid, linear progression through educational levels with limited opportunities for multiple entry and exit points.


Which of the above statements is/are NOT correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the NCrF's goals and components.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The NCrF *does* allow for flexibility in diverse learning pathways and *does* enable multiple entry and exit points, promoting lifelong learning. The framework aims to create a more fluid and adaptable educational system, contrary to what statements 3 and 4 suggest.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not identify both inaccurate statements. This question assesses understanding of the NCrF's flexibility and its departure from traditional, rigid educational structures. It tests the ability to discern subtle differences in the description of educational frameworks.



**6. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  The GHI considers indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India consistently ranks among the top 20 countries in the GHI.
4.  The Indian government has not raised objections to the GHI methodology.


Which of the above statements is/are NOT correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct; these are key indicators used in the GHI. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's ranking is significantly lower than the top 20. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Indian government has raised several objections regarding the GHI's methodology and data sources.  Only option (c) correctly identifies all three incorrect statements.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different organizations involved in releasing global indices, as well as the understanding of India's position and response to the GHI.  The distractors are cleverly designed to test knowledge of related but distinct organizations and India's official stance.


**7. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN) aims to saturate PVTG households with basic facilities.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare in India.
3.  The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.
4.  Madhya Pradesh has the lowest ST population in India in absolute numbers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all correct.  PM JANMAN focuses on providing basic amenities to PVTGs, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry, and the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Madhya Pradesh has the *highest*, not the lowest, ST population in absolute numbers.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  This question tests factual knowledge of government schemes, administrative structures, and international observances related to tribal welfare.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement about population numbers adds a layer of difficulty.


**8. Consider the following statements related to the Anganwadi system:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is a part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutrition of children aged 0-6 years.
4.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used for tracking nutrition service delivery.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Anganwadi system is integral to ICDS, AWWs and AWHs receive both fixed and performance-based payments, and the Poshan Tracker app aids in monitoring nutrition programs. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative has a broader focus than just children aged 0-6; it also addresses adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  This question assesses knowledge of a crucial social welfare program, its components, and related initiatives.  The distractor cleverly focuses on the scope of a specific program expansion, testing detailed understanding.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:**

1. The policy addresses menstruation as a natural bodily process.
2.  The policy prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations.
3.  The policy mandates paid menstrual leave for all workers in India.
4. Spain was the first country in the world to grant paid menstrual leave.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the goals of the draft policy.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the policy doesn't mandate paid leave at the national level.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while Spain was the first European country to grant paid menstrual leave, other countries had already implemented such policies.  Therefore, only two statements are correct. This question tests knowledge of a current policy initiative focusing on menstrual hygiene and its scope.  It uses distractors relating to international policy comparisons, highlighting the need for precise knowledge.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.
2.  The Act categorizes offences committed by juveniles as heinous, serious, or petty.
3. The 2021 amendment to the Act removed the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults in heinous offenses.
4.  The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to assess child suspects.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct reflections of the Act.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment *did not* remove the provision for trying 16-18 year olds as adults in heinous offenses; it retained this provision.  Therefore, only three statements are correct. This question demands precise knowledge of a key piece of legislation related to child rights and the justice system.  The distractor plays on a specific amendment, requiring detailed understanding of the legal framework.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  The Bharia PVTG is found only in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The government initially categorized these groups as PTGs in 1973, later renaming them as PVTGs in 2006.  Statement 2 is also correct; these are key criteria used for identifying PVTGs, reflecting their unique socio-economic vulnerabilities. Statement 3 is correct; Odisha does indeed house the largest number of PVTGs. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the De-notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.
4.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a nomadic group from Rajasthan.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The DNTs are a specific subset of nomadic communities that faced historical criminalization under British rule. Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed. Statement 3 is correct; the Renke Commission provided this estimate.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group, not from Rajasthan, but from Karnataka. Therefore, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect.


**3. Consider the following statements about measures undertaken for Tribal Welfare:**

1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2.  The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.
3.  The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission aims to saturate PVTG households with basic facilities.
4.  The Panchsheel Principles emphasize the imposition of alien values on tribal communities.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a central role in tribal welfare initiatives. Statement 2 is also correct; this day is dedicated to promoting and protecting the rights of indigenous populations. Statement 3 is correct; the Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission focuses on providing basic amenities to PVTGs.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The Panchsheel Principles for tribal development actually advocate against the imposition of alien values, emphasizing respecting tribal traditions and self-determination.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  Reservation under the RPwD Act applies to police forces.
4.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions. Statement 2 is also correct; the Act significantly broadened the definition of disability. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy. Statement 4 is correct; free education is a key provision of the Act for children with benchmark disabilities. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements related to Manual Scavenging:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) bans manual scavenging.
2.  The PEMSR Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 1 year imprisonment for violations.
3.  The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines.
4.  Safal karamcharis are not considered manual scavengers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits manual scavenging. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine up to ₹1 lakh for violations. Statement 3 is correct; the Act mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines. Statement 4 is incorrect; Safal karamcharis, even if working in municipalities or other organizations, are still considered manual scavengers if they handle human waste without proper protective gear. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following about the National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT):**

1.  The NCDNT is tasked with preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship is exclusively for DNTs.
3.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme constructs hostels only for DNT boys.
4.  The SEED scheme provides health insurance to all DNT families.


Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 2, 3, and 4
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCDNT has this mandate. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship aims to improve educational empowerment of DNTs, it's not exclusively for them. It also covers those not covered under SC/ST/OBC categories. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Nanaji Deshmukh scheme constructs hostels for both DNT boys and girls. Statement 4 is incorrect. The SEED scheme provides health insurance, but not necessarily to *all* DNT families; the coverage may have specific criteria. Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.


**7. Consider the following about initiatives to promote women in STEM:**

1.  The Boeing Sukanya Program focuses solely on training women to be pilots.
2.  I-STEM provides a platform for accessing research infrastructure and labs across India.
3.  The Vigyan Jyoti initiative is targeted at girls in higher education.
4.  BioCARe is exclusively for unemployed women scientists.


Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Boeing Sukanya Program aims to support girls' entry into the aviation sector, which includes broader STEM fields beyond pilot training. Statement 2 is correct; I-STEM facilitates access to research facilities. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Vigyan Jyoti initiative targets meritorious girls in *high school* to encourage STEM pursuits. Statement 4 is incorrect. BioCARe is a career development program for both employed and unemployed women scientists. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1. The POSH Act is based on the Vishaka Guidelines.
2. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact and advances.
3.  The POSH Act mandates Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 10 or more employees.
4. The POSH Act covers only women in the organized sector.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the POSH Act provided legal backing to the Vishaka Guidelines. Statement 2 is incorrect. The POSH Act's definition of sexual harassment is broader, encompassing physical contact, demands for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, and other unwelcome sexual conduct. Statement 3 is correct; ICCs are mandatory for organizations meeting this size criterion. Statement 4 is incorrect. The POSH Act's coverage extends to both organized and unorganized sectors, encompassing a wide range of women, including those in informal employment. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements on the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

1. The Act permits only altruistic surrogacy.
2. The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).
3. The Act allows commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals.
4. The Act mandates written consent from the surrogate mother for an abortion.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy. Statement 2 is also correct; the NARTSB is a key institution established under the Act. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act specifically bans commercial surrogacy, and it doesn't permit it for foreign nationals. Statement 4 is correct; the Act requires written consent from the surrogate mother for abortion, in compliance with the MTP Act, 1971.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:**

1. The MTP Act allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks on the advice of one doctor.
2.  The MTP Act allows termination beyond 24 weeks only in cases of foetal abnormalities.
3.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the definition of rape under the MTP Act includes marital rape.
4. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, repealed the MTP Act.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; this is a key provision of the amended MTP Act. Statement 2 is also correct; termination beyond 24 weeks is permissible only under specific conditions, primarily foetal abnormalities. Statement 3 is correct; the Supreme Court's ruling extended the scope of the Act to include marital rape. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, did not repeal the MTP Act; it introduced provisions related to causing miscarriage. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding ODF Plus villages:**

1.  Sustained ODF status is a mandatory criterion.
2.  Solid waste management systems are always required.
3.  Visual cleanliness, including minimal litter, is a key component.
4.  ODF Plus IEC messages must be displayed prominently.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics of an ODF Plus village?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An ODF Plus village must maintain its ODF status (statement 1 is correct), and visual cleanliness (statement 3 is correct), along with ODF Plus IEC messages (statement 4 is correct). However, it only requires *either* solid *or* liquid waste management systems, not both (statement 2 is incorrect).  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.  The inclusion of "always" in statement 2 makes it a strong distractor, playing on the common understanding of ODF Plus initiatives but subtly altering a key detail.


**2. Consider the following organizations mentioned in the context of population and development:**

1.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
2.  UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)
4.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

How many of the above organizations have released reports specifically focusing on global or national population trends or food security in recent years?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

UNFPA releases the State of World Population report, directly addressing global population trends (making 1 correct). UNDESA publishes the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report, which includes population-related data (making 2 correct).  WFP focuses on food security and publishes the Global Report on Food Crisis, making 3 correct. IFPRI also focuses on food policy and released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, making 4 correct. Therefore, all three organizations mentioned have released relevant reports.


**3. Consider the following features of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  A 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2.  Mandatory board examinations for Grades 10 and 12 only once a year.
3.  Emphasis on multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages.
4.  A rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects.

How many of the above features are accurately reflected in the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure (statement 1 is correct), and it emphasizes multilingualism (statement 3 is correct).  However, it allows for multiple attempts at board examinations (making statement 2 incorrect), and it aims to remove the rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects (making statement 4 incorrect). Therefore, only two features are accurately described. The inclusion of "mandatory" and "rigid" in statements 2 and 4 respectively creates strong distractors.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of 8 levels, with levels 1-4 dedicated to school education.
3.  It exclusively focuses on academic credits earned through formal institutions.
4.  It introduces the concept of "notional learning hours" for credit calculation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe key aspects of the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF does integrate credits from various educational pathways (statement 1 is correct), it employs an 8-level structure with levels 1-4 for school education (statement 2 is correct), and it incorporates the concept of "notional learning hours" (statement 4 is correct).  However, it doesn't *exclusively* focus on formal academic credits; it also includes experiential learning (making statement 3 incorrect).  Therefore, three statements are accurate. The word "exclusively" in statement 3 acts as a crucial distractor.


**5. Consider the following initiatives aimed at addressing social issues in India:**

1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024.
2.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA).
3.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR).
4.  The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act).

How many of the above initiatives primarily focus on the protection and empowerment of women?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy Rules (1), PWDVA (2), and POSH Act (4) all directly address women's rights and protection. While the PEMSR (3) addresses a crucial social issue, it doesn't primarily focus on women's empowerment.  Therefore, three of the listed initiatives primarily focus on women's protection and empowerment.  The inclusion of PEMSR as a distractor highlights the need for careful reading and understanding of the specific focus of each act.


**6. Consider the following UN bodies involved in addressing issues related to children's rights:**

1.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)
2.  The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
3.  The World Food Programme (WFP)
4.  The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)


How many of the above UN bodies have a direct mandate related to children's rights and well-being?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNCRC (1) directly monitors the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The UNHCR (4) also works to protect children who are refugees or asylum seekers. While the UNCPD (2) addresses population issues indirectly impacting children, and WFP (3) works on food security which benefits children, neither has a direct mandate focused solely on children's rights.  Therefore, only two of the listed UN bodies have a direct mandate related to children's rights.  The inclusion of UNCPD and WFP as distractors tests the candidate's understanding of each organization's precise role.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  It assesses performance at both state and district levels.
2.  It uses a ten-grade classification system.
3.  It is solely based on data from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
4.  It includes assessments of effective classroom transactions and school safety.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the PGI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PGI assesses performance at both state and district levels (statement 1 is correct), uses a ten-grade system (statement 2 is correct), and includes assessments of classroom transactions and school safety (statement 4 is correct). However, it uses data from UDISE+ in addition to NAS (making statement 3 incorrect). Therefore, three statements accurately describe the PGI. The inclusion of "solely" in statement 3 serves as a key distractor.


**8. Consider the following aspects of higher education in India:**

1.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims for a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2035.
2.  The NEP 2020 promotes multidisciplinary education and research universities (MERUs).
3.  The establishment of Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) requires a minimum of 20 years of institutional existence.
4.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) can offer online programs in India without any restrictions.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the current state of higher education in India according to the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 does aim for a 50% GER by 2035 (statement 1 is correct), and it promotes MERUs (statement 2 is correct). However, the requirement of 20 years of institutional existence for DTBUs has been changed (making statement 3 incorrect), and FHEIs are restricted from offering online programs (making statement 4 incorrect).  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.  The inclusion of statements 3 and 4 with subtle changes from the facts creates effective distractors.


**9. Consider the following international organizations involved in food security and related issues:**

1.  The World Food Programme (WFP)
2.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
3.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
4.  The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC)

How many of these organizations have released reports or undertaken initiatives directly related to global food security or hunger in recent years?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The WFP (1) directly addresses food security issues globally.  IFPRI (2) conducts research and provides policy solutions related to food security.  UNDESA (3), through its reports on SDGs, also includes data and analysis related to food security.  The UNCRC (4), while focusing on children's rights, does not have a primary focus on food security. Therefore, three organizations have direct involvement in food security issues. The inclusion of UNCRC as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of the organization's mandate.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the  organizations involved in human rights:**

1.  The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) works to protect refugees' rights.
2.  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).
3.  The UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII) focuses solely on economic development issues for indigenous groups.
4.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in India is automatically accredited by GANHRI.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (1) does indeed work to protect refugee rights. GANHRI (2) does accredit NHRIs.  However, UNPFII (3) addresses a broader range of issues beyond just economic development for indigenous groups.  The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI is not automatic and has been deferred (making statement 4 incorrect). Therefore, only two statements are correct.  The inclusion of statements 3 and 4, which contain partially true but ultimately inaccurate information, makes this question challenging.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding accurate factual recall.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct descriptions of the NCrF.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF *encompasses*, but does not replace, existing frameworks like NSQF and NHEQF.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect provisions of the Act. Statement 4 is incorrect; Safal Karamcharis, who work as sweepers or cleaning workers, *are* considered manual scavengers unless they use appropriate protective gear.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements related to the De-notified Tribes (DNTs):**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are partially correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure. It emphasizes scientific inquiry.  However, it does *not* completely eliminate board exams; it suggests changes to their frequency and format. Statement 2 is incorrect; it recommends proficiency in at least three languages.  Therefore, only three statements are partially or fully correct.


**9. Consider the following about the  National Medical Commission (NMC):**

4. The NMC is directly under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NMC is indeed a statutory body under the 2019 Act, its WFME accreditation has implications for medical colleges' accreditation, and it oversees medical education and practice.  However, Statement 4 is not explicitly stated and might be misleading.  While the NMC's work is closely related to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, it's not directly under its administrative control. Therefore, only three statements are definitively correct.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. India has ratified the convention, the 2016 Act prohibits child labor below 14, and the PENCiL portal aids rescue and rehabilitation. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NCLP also includes rehabilitation and education programs, not just financial aid. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; the World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the index considers women's empowerment, it also assesses other parameters like economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.  A more accurate assessment of its focus is on the overall gender gap, comparing women's achievements to men's in various areas. Statement 3 is correct; India's 2023 ranking of 127 out of 146 countries indicates it was below the median. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the nature and scope of the index and India's performance.


2. Consider the following regarding the Gender Social Norms Index:

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the CSTT operates under the Ministry of Education, but the passage mentions it's working for Indian Languages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Achieving ODF Plus status requires the implementation of either solid *or* liquid waste management systems, or both, in addition to sustained ODF status.  It's not limited to solid waste.

Statement 3 is correct. A primary goal of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) is to achieve ODF status in all villages across India, significantly improving rural sanitation.

Statement 4 is correct. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) is managed by the Ministry of Jal Shakti, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The Ministry of Jal Shakti is responsible for overall water and sanitation initiatives.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are accurate.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages for all students, with at least two being Indian languages.
3.  It integrates contributions to knowledge from ancient to contemporary Indian scholars across various disciplines.
4.  It introduces hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, aiming for a more holistic and flexible system.  Statement 1 is correct.  The framework also emphasizes multilingualism, pushing for proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages. This makes statement 2 correct.  Furthermore, the NCF-SE explicitly integrates Indian contributions to knowledge across disciplines, reflecting a focus on Indian heritage and achievements. Statement 3 is also correct.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The NCF-SE explicitly rejects hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage, advocating for flexibility and choice.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) are accurate.


2. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):

1.  It integrates credits from school, higher education, and vocational training into a single framework.
2.  It establishes a system for storing accumulated credits in an Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).
3.  It utilizes a fixed number of notional learning hours (1200 hours/year) across all education levels.
4.  It restricts multiple entry and exit options within the educational ecosystem.

Which of the above features are correctly described in relation to the NCrF?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF aims to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across different educational pathways, encompassing school education, higher education, and vocational training. This aligns with statement 1.  The framework also establishes the ABC to digitally store and manage these accumulated credits, making statement 2 correct.  The NCrF does indeed introduce the concept of notional learning hours, setting a standard of 1200 hours per year, validating statement 3. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly promotes multiple entry and exit points, allowing for flexibility and lifelong learning. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the NCrF.


3. Consider the following statements regarding the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:

1. The NRF is primarily financed through grants and loans solely from the central government.
2. The NRF's Governing Board is chaired by the Union Minister of Science & Technology.
3.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
4. The NRF is modeled on the United Kingdom's National Science Foundation.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the central government provides significant funding to the NRF, it's not the sole source.  The NRF also receives donations and income from investments, making statement 1 incorrect. The Prime Minister chairs the NRF's Governing Board, not the Union Minister of Science & Technology, rendering statement 2 false. The NRF did indeed subsume the SERB, making statement 3 correct.  Finally, the NRF is modeled after the *US* National Science Foundation, not the UK's, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only two statements (3) are accurate.


4. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:

1.  The PGI assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2. The PGI uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
3.  In the 2021-22 PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4. The PGI-D report covers data from both 2020-21 and 2021-22.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the PGI?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI does indeed assess school education performance at both the state and district levels, making statement 1 correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the PGI utilizes data from both the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the NAS. Statement 3 is correct; no state/UT attained the highest grade in the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment.  Finally, the PGI-D report combines data from both 2020-21 and 2021-22, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


5. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:

1. It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2. It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3. It excludes police forces from the reservation policy for PwDs.
4. It does not provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, does mandate a minimum of 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs, not 5%, making statement 1 incorrect.  The act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks, making statement 2 correct.  Police forces are specifically excluded from the reservation policy, making statement 3 correct.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the act explicitly provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18.  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 3) accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016.


6. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):

1.  It defines manual scavengers as only those employed to handle decomposed human waste.
2.  It makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines.
3.  It mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines immediately upon the Act's enactment.
4.  It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial aid.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers more broadly, including those handling both decomposed and undecomposed human waste, making statement 1 incorrect.  The act does make it an offense to construct insanitary latrines, making statement 2 correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the act provides a timeframe for the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines, not immediate demolition.  The act does include provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including alternative employment and financial assistance, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the PEMSR Act.


7. Consider the following regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):

1.  ODF status requires every household and public institution to use safe sanitation technologies.
2.  An ODF Plus village has sustained ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village necessitates visual cleanliness and IEC messaging in addition to waste management.
4.  ODF Plus Model villages require only liquid waste management systems to be implemented.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission's ODF and ODF Plus categories?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The definition of ODF status correctly includes the use of safe sanitation technologies by all households and public institutions, making statement 1 accurate.  An ODF Plus village does require sustained ODF status and the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management, making statement 2 correct.  An ODF Plus Model village goes further, requiring visual cleanliness and IEC messaging alongside waste management systems, making statement 3 correct.  Statement 4 is incorrect; ODF Plus Model villages require *both* solid and liquid waste management systems. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the Swachh Bharat Mission's ODF categories.


8. Consider the following about the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)'s State of World Population Report 2023:

1.  The report projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2023.
2. The report indicates India has one of the oldest populations globally.
3. The report states India's total fertility rate is currently above 2.5.
4.  The report highlights a significant increase in life expectancy for both Indian males and females.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect findings from the UNFPA's report?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA report does project India to surpass China in population, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the report highlights India's relatively young population.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report indicates India's total fertility rate is around 2.0, not above 2.5.  The report does project an increase in life expectancy for both Indian men and women, although the exact figures might vary slightly from the report's data, making statement 4 approximately correct. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect findings from the UNFPA's report.


9. Consider the following about the  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)'s Global Food Policy Report 2023:

1. The report attributes the rise in food insecurity to factors like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change.
2. The report indicates a decrease in basic food basket prices in many countries during 2021-22.
3.  The report predicts that climate change will significantly reduce the number of undernourished people by 2050.
4. The report is published by a research center associated with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).


Which statements accurately reflect the findings or context of the IFPRI's report?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IFPRI report does attribute the rise in food insecurity to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and other crises, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the report highlights a *surge* in food prices during 2021-22, not a decrease.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report predicts climate change will *increase* the number of undernourished people.  Statement 4 is correct; IFPRI is indeed a research center associated with CGIAR.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the IFPRI report.



10. Consider the following statements regarding the  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)'s Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report:

1. The report documents over 100 million people forcibly displaced worldwide in 2022.
2. The report indicates that forced migration due to climate change decreased in 2022 compared to 2021.
3.  The report highlights that low- and middle-income countries host a majority of the world's refugees.
4. The report shows a significant decrease in the number of stateless people in 2022.

Which of the above statements accurately represent findings from the UNHCR report?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR report does document a significant number of forcibly displaced people (over 100 million) in 2022, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the report shows an *increase* in forced migration due to climate change and other factors.  Statement 3 is correct; low- and middle-income countries host a large percentage of the world's refugees.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the report shows a slight *increase* in the number of stateless people.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the UNHCR report's findings.



**1. Consider the following statements related to ODF Plus villages:**

1.  Sustained ODF status is a prerequisite.
2.  Solid waste management systems are mandatory.
3.  Liquid waste management systems are mandatory.
4.  Visual cleanliness, including minimal litter, is required.
5.  ODF Plus IEC messages must be displayed.
6.  The village must have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the criteria for an ODF Plus Model village?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

An ODF Plus village, by definition, maintains its ODF status and implements either solid or liquid waste management.  Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 and 3 are partially correct as only one is mandatory, not both. An ODF Plus *Model* village goes further, requiring *both* solid and liquid waste management systems (statement 6), visual cleanliness (statement 4), and the display of ODF Plus IEC messages (statement 5). Therefore, statements 1, 4, 5, and 6 correctly describe ODF Plus Model villages. Statement 2 and 3 are incorrect because they state that solid and liquid waste management are mandatory individually, when in fact, both are required only for the 'Model' designation.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023:**

1.  It projects India's population to surpass China's by mid-2023.
2.  It highlights India as one of the youngest countries globally.
3.  It indicates a declining fertility rate in India.
4.  It predicts migration as the primary driver of population growth in high-income countries.
5.  It focuses solely on the challenges of aging populations in developing nations.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key findings of the report?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) Only five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA report indeed projects India to become the most populous country by mid-2023 (statement 1), highlighting its young population (statement 2) and a declining fertility rate (statement 3). The report also correctly anticipates migration as the main driver of population growth in high-income countries (statement 4).  However, statement 5 is incorrect; the report covers broader demographic trends, not solely focusing on aging in developing nations.  Therefore, four statements accurately reflect the report's key findings.


**3. Consider the following organizations mentioned in relation to population and development:**

1.  International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS)
2.  United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)
4.  United Nations Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
5.  Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR)

How many of the above organizations have released reports or data directly related to population trends or sustainable development goals in recent years?


(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IIPS collaborated with UNFPA on the India Ageing Report 2023. UNDESA released the SDG Progress Report 2023.  The UNCPD held its 56th session focused on population and development.  IFPRI, a CGIAR research center, released the Global Food Policy Report 2023, which indirectly relates to population and resource sustainability.  The WFP's work, while relevant to population well-being, doesn't directly involve releasing reports on population trends in the same way as the others.  Therefore, four of these organizations have directly released relevant reports or data.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI):**

1.  It is released annually by the World Economic Forum.
2.  It assesses gender parity across four parameters: Economic Participation, Education, Health, and Political Empowerment.
3.  India's 2023 ranking reflects a significant improvement from previous years.
4.  The index measures solely women's empowerment without comparing it to men's status.
5.  It includes a parameter focused on women's physical integrity.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the GGGI?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the GGGI is released annually by the World Economic Forum and assesses gender parity across those four parameters. Statement 3 is incorrect; the provided text indicates India's ranking worsened. Statement 4 is incorrect; the index compares women's status relative to men's.  Statement 5 is partially correct; while the text mentions a Gender Social Norms Index with a dimension on physical integrity, this is not a feature of the GGGI itself.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following indices related to gender equality and women's empowerment:**

1.  Global Gender Gap Index
2.  Gender Social Norms Index
3.  Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index
4.  Women's Empowerment Index
5.  Global Gender Parity Index

How many of these indices specifically focus on measuring aspects of gender equality or women's empowerment?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Social Norms Index directly measure aspects of gender inequality. The Women's Empowerment Index and Global Gender Parity Index both focus on women's empowerment. The Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index, while relevant to overall well-being, is not specifically focused on gender equality or women's empowerment. Thus, four of the listed indices directly address gender equality or women's empowerment.


**6. Consider the following statements about the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The Prime Minister chairs the NRF's Governing Board.
2.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
3.  The NRF primarily focuses on funding research in humanities and social sciences.
4.  The Department of Science and Technology is the administrative department for the NRF.
5.  The NRF's funding comes solely from government grants.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct based on the provided text. The Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board, the SERB is subsumed, and the Department of Science and Technology handles administration.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the NRF includes humanities and social sciences interfaces, it's not the primary focus. Statement 5 is incorrect; the NRF receives funding from various sources, including donations and investments.  Therefore, four statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following features of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates board examinations only at the end of Grade 10.
3.  It emphasizes multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages.
4.  It maintains a strict separation between academic and vocational subjects.
5.  It integrates contributions of Indians to various disciplines throughout history.

How many of the above accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are accurate reflections of the NCF-SE. It does propose the 5+3+3+4 structure, emphasizes multilingualism, and integrates Indian contributions to knowledge.  Statement 2 is incorrect; it allows for multiple attempts at board exams. Statement 4 is incorrect; it aims for flexibility and integration between academic and vocational subjects. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the NCF-SE.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):**

1.  It recently issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses.
2.  It is primarily concerned with the welfare of children below the age of 16.
3.  It is a statutory body under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
4.  It is directly involved in the adoption process of orphaned children.
5.  Its mandate is limited to providing legal aid to child victims of crime.

How many of these statements are true about the NCPCR?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCPCR did release guidelines for assessing child suspects. Statement 3 is also correct; it's a statutory body under the JJ Act.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the JJ Act defines a child as anyone under 18, and the NCPCR's jurisdiction extends to this age group. Statement 4 is partially correct; while it plays a role in child welfare, it doesn't directly handle individual adoptions. Statement 5 is incorrect; its mandate is broader than just legal aid. Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It completely bans the employment of manual scavengers.
2.  It defines manual scavengers as those handling decomposed human waste.
3.  It mandates the construction of sanitary latrines to prevent manual scavenging.
4.  It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment schemes.
5.  It assigns responsibility for identifying manual scavengers solely to the central government.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the provisions of the PEMSR Act?


(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the PEMSR Act.  The Act bans manual scavenging, mandates sanitary latrines, and provides for rehabilitation. Statement 2 is partially correct; the definition includes handling *undecomposed* waste. Statement 5 is incorrect; local authorities also share responsibility for identification. Therefore, four statements correctly reflect the Act's provisions.


**10. Consider the following schemes related to the welfare of De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship Scheme
2.  Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme for construction of hostels
3.  Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)
4.  Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS)
5.  National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE)

How many of the above schemes are specifically designed to address the needs and welfare of DNTs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Dr. Ambedkar Scholarship Scheme, the Nanaji Deshmukh Hostel Scheme, and the SEED scheme are all specifically for DNTs. The SRMS scheme is for manual scavengers, many of whom may be from DNTs, but it's not exclusively for them.  The NAMASTE scheme focuses on mechanized sanitation, indirectly benefiting DNTs but not specifically targeting them. Therefore, three schemes directly address DNT welfare.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system:**

1.  It's a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  Its primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the state governments.
4.  The 'Poshan Tracker' app is used by AWWs for efficient service delivery and monitoring, but doesn't track nutritional service delivery at the last mile.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the MoWCD, aiming to improve the nutritional and health status of the specified groups.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While AWWs do receive a fixed honorarium, it's decided by the *central* government, not state governments, though states may add supplementary amounts.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because the Poshan Tracker app *does* facilitate last-mile tracking of nutrition service delivery.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.



**2. Consider the following regarding the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan:**

1. Launched in 2017, it aims to reduce stunting only in the most malnourished districts.
2. It monitors and guides nutrition-related interventions across various ministries.
3.  It solely focuses on improving utilization of key Anganwadi Services to achieve its objectives.
4. Its primary goal is the holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women and children but not mothers.


Which of the above statements accurately describes the POSHAN Abhiyan?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is partially incorrect as while the mission prioritizes districts with high malnutrition, it doesn't *solely* focus on them.  Statement 2 is correct; the NNM coordinates across ministries. Statement 3 is incorrect as it goes beyond Anganwadi services. Statement 4 is incorrect because it includes mothers in its target group. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.



**3. Consider the following features related to the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It's released annually by the World Food Programme.
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score has steadily improved since 2015.
4.  The Indian government's objections to the GHI are primarily based on methodological issues and data accuracy.

Which of the above statements regarding the GHI are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  Statement 2 is correct; these regions consistently report the highest hunger levels. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while there has been some improvement in India's score, it hasn't been consistently steady. Statement 4 accurately reflects the Indian government's concerns. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are fully accurate.



**4. Consider the following statements concerning the  Universal Health Coverage (UHC):**

1.  UHC ensures all individuals have access to quality health services without financial hardship, covering the full spectrum of essential services.
2.  The key dimensions of UHC are accessibility, affordability, and quality.
3.  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush directly contributes to achieving UHC by providing universal health insurance.
4.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to improve access to quality healthcare but doesn't focus on national portability of health services.


How many of these statements correctly define or describe aspects of UHC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately define core tenets of UHC. Statement 3 is incorrect; Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, not universal health insurance which is a different aspect of UHC. Statement 4 is also incorrect; ABDM *does* aim for national portability. Thus, only three statements are accurate descriptions of UHC.



**5. Consider the following initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
3.  National Health Policy 2017
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush
5.  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5)


Which of the above are directly aimed at achieving Universal Health Coverage in India?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) All of the above
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Ayushman Bharat Yojana, ABDM, and National Health Policy 2017 are all directly aimed at improving healthcare access and affordability, key components of UHC. Intensified Mission Indradhanush, while crucial for public health, indirectly supports UHC by improving child health outcomes. NFHS-5 is a data collection exercise and not a direct UHC initiative.  Therefore, only 1, 2, 3, and 4 are directly focused on UHC.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  'Triple Threat' report released by UNICEF:**

1.  It examines the combined burden of inadequate access to basic water and sanitation services, high mortality from unsafe WASH among children under 5, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.
2. It focuses on the combined burden of inadequate access to basic water and sanitation services, low mortality from unsafe WASH among children under 5, and low risk of climate and environmental hazards.
3.  It highlights that less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services is a significant contributor to child mortality.
4. It examines the combined burden of adequate access to basic water and sanitation services, low mortality from unsafe WASH among children under 5, and high risk of climate and environmental hazards.

Which statement best summarizes the UNICEF 'Triple Threat' report's key focus?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 accurately reflects the three key elements highlighted in UNICEF's 'Triple Threat' report: inadequate WASH access, high child mortality related to unsafe WASH, and high risk from climate/environmental hazards.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 misrepresent one or more of these crucial elements.


**7. Consider the following about the  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status:**

1.  ODF Plus status signifies the sustained absence of open defecation and the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems.
2. An ODF Plus Model village has arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and displays ODF Plus IEC messages.
3. Achievement of ODF Plus status requires only the sustained absence of open defecation, regardless of waste management systems.
4. ODF Plus Model villages only require the sustained absence of open defecation and arrangements for solid waste management.


How many of the statements accurately describe the ODF Plus status and its model?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly define the ODF Plus status and the stricter criteria for an ODF Plus Model village. Statements 3 and 4 misrepresent the requirements for achieving ODF Plus status and model village status, respectively, by omitting key elements like waste management systems and visual cleanliness.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates only two languages for proficiency, one of which must be a native Indian language.
3.  It recommends a shift to a semester system with two board exams per year for grades 10 and 12.
4.  It strictly separates academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.


How many of these statements correctly reflect the key features of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 correctly reflects a key feature of the NCF-SE. Statement 2 is incorrect; it recommends proficiency in at least *three* languages, with at least two being Indian. Statement 3 is partially correct regarding the semester system but inaccurate about the two exams per year, only the best score is retained. Statement 4 is incorrect; it advocates for *integration* of academic and vocational subjects.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The NRF is primarily financed through grants and loans from the central government only.
2.  The NRF subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
3. The NRF's Governing Board is headed by the Union Minister of Science & Technology.
4. The NRF’s mandate includes strategic direction for research in natural sciences, engineering, technology, and humanities but not social sciences.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; NRF funding includes various sources beyond central government grants and loans. Statement 2 is correct; SERB was subsumed. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Prime Minister heads the Governing Board. Statement 4 is incorrect; social sciences are explicitly included in the NRF's mandate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, regardless of protective gear usage.
2.  The act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines or employ individuals to clean sewers without protective gear.
3. The act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
4.  The act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance but not property assistance.

How many of the above accurately reflect the provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key provisions of the PEMSR Act. Statement 3 is incorrect;  the act mandates conversion or demolition but doesn't set a strict timeframe for *all* insanitary latrines. Statement 4 is also incorrect; property assistance is included in the rehabilitation provisions.  Therefore, only two statements are fully accurate.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium.
3.  The Poshan Tracker app is used for nutrition service delivery monitoring.
4.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving nutrition for children aged 0-6 years.
5.  AWWs and AWHs are covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY).

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Anganwadi system and related initiatives?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are accurate. The Anganwadi system is indeed a crucial component of the ICDS scheme, aiming to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The Poshan Tracker app plays a vital role in monitoring nutrition service delivery, aiding AWWs in their work. AWWs and AWHs are also beneficiaries of social security schemes like PMJJBY.  Statement 2 is correct as AWWs receive a fixed honorarium, though the exact amount may vary. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While improved nutrition for children aged 0-6 is a primary goal, Saksham Anganwadis also expand their focus to include adolescent girls (14-18 years) in specific districts and the North Eastern Region, as well as early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years.  Therefore, only four statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Nutrition Mission (NNM) aims to reduce stunting primarily in districts with the highest malnutrition burden.
2.  Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) primarily focus on providing early childhood care and development.
3.  The "Triple Threat Report" by UNICEF highlights the combined burden of water, sanitation, and hygiene threats on children.
4.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) shows consistent improvement in hunger levels globally since 2015.
5.  The ODF Plus status requires sustained ODF status and implementation of solid waste management systems.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect aspects of nutrition, sanitation, and related initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are accurate. The NNM targets high-malnutrition districts to reduce stunting. The UNICEF "Triple Threat Report" correctly highlights the combined impact of WASH-related factors on child health.  An ODF Plus village must maintain ODF status and implement either solid or liquid waste management. Statement 2 is incorrect; ANMs concentrate on maternal and child health, immunizations, and institutional-based care, not primarily early childhood development.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the GHI indicates little progress in reducing global hunger since 2015, highlighting the impact of various crises. Thus, only three statements are entirely correct.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
2.  The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific conditions.
3.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates ART clinics but does not address surrogacy.
4.  The Supreme Court has allowed surrogacy for women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome under specific circumstances.
5.  Commercial surrogacy is permitted under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of surrogacy and abortion laws in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The 2024 amendment to surrogacy rules allows donor gametes under specific conditions. The Supreme Court has indeed made provisions for surrogacy in cases of MRKH syndrome. Statement 2 is incorrect; the MTP Act, as amended, allows termination up to 20 weeks, not 24. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ART Act does include provisions related to surrogacy. Statement 5 is also incorrect; commercial surrogacy is explicitly banned under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.  Only two statements are fully accurate.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.
2.  The Performance Grading Index (PGI) assesses the performance of the school education system at the state and district levels only based on UDISE+ data.
3.  The National Credit Framework (NCrF) integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, but excludes experiential learning.
4.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for Deemed to be University status.
5.  The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) recommends a 5+3+3+4 age-based schooling structure.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's education policies and initiatives?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 5 are accurate. NEP 2020 sets the GER target for higher education. The 2023 UGC regulations allow younger institutions to apply for DtbU status. The NCF-SE proposes the 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 2 is incorrect; PGI uses both UDISE+ data and NAS data. Statement 3 is incorrect; NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning in its credit framework. Therefore, only four statements are entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY) aims to increase fish production to 22 million metric tons by 2024.
2.  The Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) health coverage extends to all senior citizens aged 70 and above, irrespective of income.
3.  The Open Network for Digital Commerce (ONDC) launched Saarthi, a multilingual buyer app initially supporting only Hindi and English.
4.  The Centre for Rural Enterprise Acceleration through Technology (CREATE) in Leh focuses on Pashmina wool roving and essential oil extraction.
5.  The BHASKAR initiative aims to decentralize and fragment India's startup ecosystem.


How many of the above statements correctly describe government schemes and initiatives?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 4 are accurate. PMMSY had the stated aim (though whether it was achieved by 2024 is another matter). CREATE's focus on Pashmina and essential oils is accurate.  The description of Saarthi and its multilingual capabilities is also correct. Statement 2 is partially correct; the extension to senior citizens is true but the phrasing is misleading as there are exceptions. Statement 5 is incorrect; BHASKAR aims to *centralize* and strengthen collaboration within the startup ecosystem, not decentralize it. Therefore, only four statements are entirely correct.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The  "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)" report was released by UNICEF.
2.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
3.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, allows the employment of manual scavengers with appropriate protective gear.
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
5.  The  "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report" was released by the World Food Programme (WFP).


How many of the above statements correctly describe government policies, reports, and related information?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The NCDNT does prepare the state-wise list. The Manual Scavengers Act does allow employment *with* protective gear. Statement 1 is incorrect; the WASH report was released by the WHO. Statement 4 is incorrect; the 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs excludes police forces. Statement 5 is incorrect; the forced displacement report was released by UNHCR, not WFP. Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system:**

1.  It is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  Its primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium, but performance-linked incentives are not provided.
4.  The system utilizes a mobile-based application, 'Poshan Tracker,' for monitoring nutrition service delivery.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Statement 2 is also correct; improving the nutritional and health status of the target group is the core objective. Statement 4 accurately describes the use of the 'Poshan Tracker' app. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed honorarium, they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives, such as the ₹500 per month incentive for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan):**

1.  Launched in 2017, it aims to reduce stunting in districts with high malnutrition burdens.
2.  It focuses solely on improving the utilization of key Anganwadi Services.
3.  It is a joint initiative of the Ministries of Health and Family Welfare and Women and Child Development.
4.  Its objective includes ensuring holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.


How many of the above features are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 correctly reflect the aims and objectives of POSHAN Abhiyan.  The mission was indeed launched in 2017 to tackle malnutrition, particularly stunting, and aims for holistic development and nutrition for the specified groups. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while improving Anganwadi service utilization is a key component, the mission's scope is broader than solely focusing on this aspect. It involves interventions across various ministries and sectors. Statement 3 is also incorrect; POSHAN Abhiyan is primarily monitored, supervised, and guided by various ministries, not just the Ministries of Health and Family Welfare and Women and Child Development.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score has shown consistent improvement since 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP. Statement 2 is correct; these regions consistently report the highest hunger levels. Statement 3 is incorrect; while India's GHI score has shown some improvement,  it hasn't been consistently improving since 2015.  Statement 4 is correct; the Indian government has voiced concerns about the GHI's methodology, data sources, and sample size.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM):**

1.  It aims to create a comprehensive digital health infrastructure for universal health coverage.
2.  It assigns a unique Health ID to every citizen for storing and managing health records.
3.  It is limited to public healthcare facilities.
4.  It utilizes telemedicine to improve healthcare access.

How many of the statements accurately describe the ABDM?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The ABDM aims to build a digital health infrastructure, assigns unique Health IDs, and leverages technology like telemedicine. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The ABDM is not limited to public facilities; it aims to integrate both public and private healthcare providers into a single digital ecosystem.  Therefore, three statements accurately describe the ABDM.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC):**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses on primary healthcare interventions.
2.  National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC at an affordable cost.
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving maternal health indicators.
4.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to ensure national portability of health services.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the stated initiative's objectives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the aim of the National Health Policy 2017. Statement 4 correctly describes a key goal of the ABDM.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while Mission Indradhanush focuses on immunization, this contributes to reducing child mortality and improving overall health, including maternal health indirectly. Statement 1 is incorrect; Ayushman Bharat Yojana has a broader scope than just primary healthcare, encompassing interventions at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the stated objectives.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  They permit surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition.
2.  They allow commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances.
3.  They prohibit surrogacy for single women.
4.  They mandate health insurance coverage for the surrogate mother.

How many of these statements accurately describe the rules?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the amended rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical conditions, ensuring at least one gamete is from the intending couple. Statement 4 is also correct; health insurance for the surrogate mother is mandated. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the rules have stipulations, they don't entirely prohibit surrogacy for single women (widows or divorcees) using self-eggs and donor sperm. Statement 2 is incorrect; the rules maintain a ban on commercial surrogacy, only allowing altruistic surrogacy. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the rules.


**7. Consider the following regarding the  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 (as amended):**

1.  It allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women.
2.  It requires the consent of only one doctor for termination up to 20 weeks.
3.  It permits termination beyond 20 weeks under specific circumstances.
4.  It explicitly prohibits abortion in cases of rape.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the MTP Act?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the Act allows termination up to 20 weeks with the advice of one doctor. Statement 3 is also correct; the Act allows termination beyond 20 weeks under specific conditions, such as fetal abnormalities or risk to the mother's life. Statement 1 is incorrect; the upper limit is 20 weeks for all women, with exceptions to 24 weeks under certain circumstances. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act does not explicitly prohibit abortion in cases of rape; these cases fall under the specified circumstances for termination beyond 20 weeks.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:**

1.  It mandates the constitution of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in all workplaces.
2.  Complaints must be filed within six months of the incident.
3.  The ICC can recommend monetary settlements during conciliation.
4.  The Act ensures the confidentiality of the complainant's identity.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act mandates the formation of an ICC in workplaces with 10 or more employees.  Statement 4 is also correct; confidentiality is a key provision to protect the complainant. Statement 2 is incorrect; the timeframe for filing complaints is three months, not six. Statement 3 is incorrect; monetary settlements are explicitly prohibited during conciliation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**

1. It defines manual scavengers solely as those employed to handle human excreta from insanitary latrines.
2. It mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines.
3. It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
4. It criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect provisions within the Act. The Act defines manual scavengers broadly, encompassing various forms of handling human waste. It mandates the construction of sanitary latrines to prevent the need for manual scavenging.  Rehabilitation measures, including alternative employment and financial aid, are central to the Act.  The construction of insanitary latrines is indeed criminalized.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2. It mandates board examinations only at the end of Grade 10.
3. It emphasizes multilingualism, with proficiency in at least three languages.
4. It promotes hard separations between academic and vocational subjects.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the NCF-SE's recommendations?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the proposed 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 3 correctly highlights the emphasis on multilingualism. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NCF-SE allows for multiple attempts at board examinations, not just at the end of Grade 10.  Statement 4 is incorrect; it advocates for flexibility and removing hard separations between academic and vocational streams. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) are permitted surrogacy using only their own eggs and donor sperm.
3.  Commercial surrogacy, involving monetary compensation beyond medical expenses, is explicitly prohibited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, significantly altered the landscape of surrogacy in India. Statement 1 is accurate; the rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes only if the resulting child has at least one gamete from the intending couple, a condition designed to maintain a genetic link to at least one parent. Statement 2 is also correct; single women are permitted to use surrogacy, but only with their own eggs and donor sperm. This provision addresses concerns about the exploitation of women and reinforces the focus on altruistic surrogacy.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, which strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy, aiming to prevent the commodification of women's bodies and the potential for exploitation. Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following statements related to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021:**

1.  The amended Act permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women based on the advice of a single doctor.
2.  The Act allows abortion beyond 20 weeks under specific circumstances, including cases of fetal abnormalities.
3.  The Act explicitly criminalizes abortions performed outside the stipulations mentioned in the act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The MTP Act, 1971, underwent significant amendment in 2021 to expand access to safe and legal abortion. While the act does allow for abortions beyond 20 weeks in certain circumstances, statement 1 is incorrect. The amended act allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women upon the advice of one registered medical practitioner. However, for pregnancies beyond 20 weeks, the act does allow for termination in specific circumstances, such as risk to the woman's life or grave fetal abnormalities. This is correctly described in statement 2. Statement 3 is also correct; the act implicitly criminalizes abortions performed outside the defined legal framework.  It does not explicitly criminalize, but the act itself only permits abortions under specific conditions and thus abortions outside these conditions become illegal.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.


**3. Consider the following features of the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  It is primarily implemented under the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and may also receive performance-linked incentives.
3.  The system exclusively focuses on the nutritional and health needs of children aged 0-6 years.
4.  Saksham Anganwadis aim to strengthen existing centers and expand services to include adolescent girls.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Anganwadi system is a cornerstone of India's efforts to improve the health and nutrition of young children and pregnant/lactating mothers. Statement 1 is true; it's a key component of the ICDS scheme. Statement 2 is also correct; AWWs receive a fixed honorarium and are eligible for performance-based incentives. Statement 3 is partially true but oversimplifies the system. While child nutrition and health are central, the system's scope extends to pregnant women and lactating mothers. However, the core of the statement is true, so it is not entirely wrong.  Statement 4 accurately describes the Saksham Anganwadi initiative, which seeks to enhance existing centers and expand services to include adolescent girls. This expansion is a key objective for improving overall health and development outcomes.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following organizations related to international efforts in population and development:**

1.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) focuses on sexual and reproductive health and rights.
2.  The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) monitors progress on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
3.  The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD) is primarily involved in disaster relief and humanitarian aid.
4.  The World Food Programme (WFP) is the leading UN agency addressing global food security and hunger.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the primary mandates of the respective organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Several UN agencies play critical roles in addressing global population, development, and humanitarian challenges. Statement 1 correctly identifies UNFPA's focus on sexual and reproductive health and rights. Statement 2 accurately describes UNDESA's role in monitoring SDG progress. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UNCPD's primary focus is on population and development issues, not disaster relief, though it may indirectly engage with those issues. Statement 4 correctly describes the WFP's mandate concerning food security. Therefore, three statements accurately reflect the primary mandates of their respective organizations.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
2.  The GHI uses indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score consistently ranks among the highest globally, indicating a severe hunger crisis.
4.  The Indian government has consistently accepted the GHI methodology and findings without reservation.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GHI provides an annual assessment of hunger levels across countries. Statement 1 is correct; it's a joint publication of Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Statement 2 is also correct; the index uses the mentioned indicators to assess hunger. Statement 3 is incorrect; while India's GHI score indicates a serious hunger situation, it does not consistently rank among the very highest globally.  The ranking changes year to year. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Indian government has often raised concerns regarding the GHI's methodology and data sources.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**

1.  The Act completely bans the employment of manual scavengers.
2.  The Act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines and their conversion into sanitary ones.
3.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
4.  The Act penalizes the construction of new insanitary latrines.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Act aims to eradicate the practice of manual scavenging and rehabilitate those affected. Statement 1 is correct; the act prohibits the employment of manual scavengers.  Statement 2 is also correct; it mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines. Statement 3 is correct; it provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment options and financial assistance. Statement 4 is also correct; it explicitly penalizes the construction of new insanitary latrines. Therefore, all statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCrF aims to create a flexible and integrated credit system for education. Statement 1 is correct; it integrates credits from different educational pathways. Statement 2 is also correct; it establishes a uniform credit system based on notional learning hours. Statement 3 is incorrect; while it indirectly supports higher education quality, its primary focus is on credit integration across all educational levels. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF does not mandate a fixed number of credits for graduation. The number of credits required varies depending on the program and level of education. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the NCrF's features.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is correct, as UNHCR works in more than 130 countries, including India. Statement 4 is also correct; a major part of UNHCR's work involves protecting human rights and improving refugee and asylum laws.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational to UNHCR's operations and mandate. However, statements 1 and 2 are incorrect.  UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  Therefore, three statements are correct.

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Anganwadi workers receive a fixed monthly honorarium, and the Anganwadi system falls under the ICDS scheme. Statement 1 is partially correct; while the primary focus is on children 0-6 years, Saksham Anganwadis also cover adolescents. Statement 4 is incorrect; Anganwadi workers are covered under several government insurance schemes. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1. The Act completely bans manual scavenging.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle human excreta from insanitary latrines without protective gear.
3. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines.
4.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

How many of the statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Act aims to abolish manual scavenging, defines it as handling human excreta without protective gear, and provides for rehabilitation.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NCF-SE proposes the 5+3+3+4 structure, emphasizes multilingualism (at least three languages), and integrates vocational education. However, statement 2 is incorrect; it doesn't advocate for the elimination of board exams but suggests changes to their format and frequency.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim for a difficult level, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding indices related to women's empowerment and gender equality:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme.
2. The Gender Social Norms Index assesses the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women globally across four dimensions: political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
3. The Path to Equal Report introduces a Women's Empowerment Index focusing solely on women's power and freedoms.
4. The Global Gender Parity Index evaluates the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human development.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 and 3 and 4 are correct. The Gender Social Norms Index and the Global Gender Parity Index, both described accurately. The Path to Equal Report does indeed introduce a Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) as described. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  The UNDP releases the Gender Social Norms Index. This subtle difference makes the question challenging and tests precise factual recall.


**2. Consider the following statements about the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1.  The NIF aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) indicators and includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
2.  The Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) is responsible for framing the NIF.
3.  The NIF currently includes over 250 indicators.
4.  MoSPI developed guidelines for States/UTs to develop State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The NIF does indeed adapt global indicators to India's context, and MoSPI circulated guidelines for SIF development.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect; the IAEG-SDGs frames the GIF, not the NIF. The NIF is developed by MoSPI. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NIF in 2023 had 284 indicators, not over 250.  The close proximity of the incorrect number to the actual number makes this a difficult question.


**3. Consider the following regarding the 2023 Global Monitoring report on Universal Health Coverage (UHC), jointly released by WHO and the World Bank:**

1. UHC aims for all people to access a full range of quality health services without financial hardship.
2.  Key dimensions of UHC include accessibility, affordability, and equity.
3. The report highlighted that progress on UHC targets is uniformly strong across all countries.
4.  Initiatives like Ayushman Bharat Yojana and ABDM are mentioned as contributing to UHC in India.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of UHC and India's efforts.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the report did *not* show uniformly strong progress globally. The report actually highlighted significant disparities and challenges in achieving UHC goals worldwide. The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but false statement increases the difficulty.


**4. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education using NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF.
2. It uses a credit system dividing education into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 representing higher education.
3.  It allows multiple entry and exit options, enabling lifelong learning.
4.  It introduces a concept of "notional learning hours," fixing the total at 1200 hours/year across all education types.

How many of these features are accurately described in the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the NCrF.  Statement 2 is incorrect; levels 1-4 in the NCrF refer to school education, not higher education.  The deliberate misrepresentation of a key numerical division increases the difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following regarding the recommendations of the Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee on accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs):**

1. The committee proposed a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
2.  The committee recommended maintaining the existing 8-point grading system of NAAC.
3. The committee suggested a composite assessment system amalgamating programme and institution accreditation.
4. The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is envisioned as a meta-accrediting body overseeing accrediting institutions.


Which of the above are recommendations of the committee?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly reflect the committee's recommendations.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the committee *did not* recommend retaining the 8-point NAAC system. They proposed a shift to a binary system. The contrast between the correct and incorrect statements makes this a challenging question.



**6. Consider these aspects of the Anganwadi system:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is primarily under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium but no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application aids AWWs in monitoring nutritional service delivery.
4.  Saksham Anganwadis focus solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Poshan Tracker is a key tool, and Saksham Anganwadis do include a focus on nutrition for children (0-6 years). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Statement 2 is also false; AWWs do receive performance-linked incentives.  The inclusion of partially true but ultimately false statements creates a difficult question.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1. The GHI is released by the World Bank.
2.  India's GHI score showed a significant improvement compared to 2015.
3.  The report highlighted that little progress has been made globally in reducing hunger since 2015.
4.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest hunger levels.

How many statements are correct regarding the GHI 2023?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct observations from the GHI 2023 report.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; India's improvement was slight, not significant.  The nuanced differences between the correct and incorrect statements increase the difficulty.


**8. Regarding the  "Temple of Healing v. Union of India" Supreme Court judgment on child adoption:**

1. The judgment urged collaborative efforts to increase the number of children in the adoption pool.
2.  The judgment focused solely on children in foster care.
3. The judgment directed states to conduct monthly drives to identify eligible children.
4.  The judgment emphasized the role of the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA).

How many of these statements accurately reflect the judgment's key aspects?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the judgment's key directives.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the judgment covered children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs)  whose parents were unfit or had not visited them for over a year, a broader category than just foster care. The subtle difference in terminology makes this a challenging question.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The act completely eradicated manual scavenging in India.
2.  The act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle human waste from insanitary latrines, even without protective gear.
3. The act mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines.
4. The act outlines rehabilitation measures for manual scavengers.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe provisions within the PEMSR Act. Statement 1 is incorrect; the act aimed to *prevent* manual scavenging, not eradicate it completely. The difference between intention and outcome makes this a difficult question.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1. The NRF is administered by the Ministry of Education.
2. The Prime Minister is the President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3. The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Prime Minister heads the board, SERB is subsumed, and funding comes from multiple sources (government grants, donations, etc.).  Statement 1 is incorrect; the NRF is administered by the Department of Science and Technology (DST), not the Ministry of Education.  The subtle distinction between the administering body and the ministry makes this a difficult question.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):**

1. It was established in 1971 as a major research center.
2. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. It works in over 60 countries, including India.
4. It primarily focuses on solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statement 3 is correct; IFPRI works in over 60 countries, including India. Statement 4 is also correct;  IFPRI provides research-based policy solutions aimed at poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction. However, statement 1 is incorrect; IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; its headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva. Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.  The close proximity of the incorrect dates (1971 vs 1975) and the similar nature of the organizations' locations (both are international organizations) makes this a challenging question.


**2. Consider the following regarding the UNHCR's 2022 report on forced displacement:**

1. The report indicated that forced displacement was 10% higher in 2022 than in 2021.
2.  Over 75% of the world's refugees were hosted by high-income countries in 2022.
3.  The report highlighted a significant increase in stateless individuals compared to 2021.
4. The report documented that children constituted less than 25% of the forcibly displaced population.


**How many of the above statements accurately reflect the UNHCR report's findings?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is correct; the report showed a 2% increase in stateless individuals compared to 2021.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the report stated a 21% increase, not 10%. Statement 2 is incorrect; the report stated that 76% of refugees were hosted by low- and middle-income countries, not high-income countries.  Statement 4 is incorrect; children constituted 30% of the forcibly displaced population. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar but incorrect figures.  The close numerical proximity of the incorrect figures (10% vs 21%, 25% vs 30%) and the reversal of the fact regarding refugee hosting countries makes this question difficult and evaluates analytical skills.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):**

1. GANHRI was established in 2000.
2.  Its headquarters are located in New York.
3.  It accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
4.  The NHRC's accreditation was deferred in 2016 due to concerns about political interference.


**How many of the above statements are accurate?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 4 is correct; GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation in 2016 due to concerns regarding political interference. Statement 1 is incorrect; GANHRI was established in 1993. Statement 2 is incorrect; its headquarters are in Geneva, not New York.  Statement 3 is incorrect; GANHRI uses the Paris Principles, not the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as the basis for accreditation.  The question tests factual recall and requires knowledge of specific details about GANHRI. The incorrect information provided in the other options is plausible, thereby increasing the question's difficulty level.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

1. UNPFII is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly.
2. It has 20 independent experts serving three-year terms.
3. Its mandate includes addressing indigenous issues related to education and health.
4.  The UNPFII's activities are solely funded by member states' contributions.


**Which of the above statements are correct?**

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is correct; UNPFII's mandate explicitly includes education and health.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; UNPFII is a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Statement 2 is incorrect; it has 16 experts, not 20. Statement 4 is incorrect; its activities are supported by a Trust Fund on Indigenous Issues, not solely by member state contributions.  This question tests detailed knowledge of the UNPFII's structure and function.  The plausible but incorrect statements make it challenging, assessing both factual recall and analytical abilities.


**5. Consider the following features of the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1.  The NIF includes indicators solely based on the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
2.  The NIF was developed in 2019.
3.  The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
4.  State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) were developed in response to the NIF.


**How many of the above statements accurately describe the NIF?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The NIF does include indicators specific to India's needs, and the development of SIFs was a direct response to the NIF's creation.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while aligned with the GIF, the NIF also includes India-specific indicators.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF was developed in 2018, not 2019. This question tests knowledge of the NIF's development and key features.  The near-correct dates and the partly true statement about the GIF make it a difficult question assessing factual recall and analytical skills.

1. The survey was conducted under the Census Act of 1948.
2.  The data collected includes caste demographics.
3.  The survey is a full-scale population census.
4.  The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India oversaw the survey.

**How many of the above statements are accurate concerning the Bihar caste survey?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 is correct; the survey did collect caste demographic data.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Census Act provides a framework for population censuses, the Bihar caste survey was described as a "social survey," not a full-scale census under the 1948 Act. Statement 3 is incorrect; it was not a full-scale population census. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Bihar state government conducted the survey, not the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. This question tests knowledge of the Bihar caste survey's specific details. The partially true statements about the census and the involvement of a government body make this a challenging question.

1. The NCDNT was established to prepare a nationwide list of DNTs.
2.  The NCDNT is responsible for implementing the SEED scheme.
3.  The NCDNT is a statutory body under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.
4.  The NCDNT's primary focus is on educational empowerment of DNTs.


**Which of the above statements accurately describe the NCDNT's role and function?**

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is entirely accurate.  The NCDNT's mandate includes preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the SEED scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the NCDNT.  Statement 3 is incorrect; it's not a statutory body.  Statement 4 is partially true; while educational empowerment is a significant aspect, it's not its sole or primary focus. This question tests specific knowledge of the NCDNT's functions, making it challenging due to the partially correct statements and the requirement to differentiate between related governmental bodies.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 6% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The RPwD Act recognizes 20 categories of disabilities.
3.  The RPwD Act establishes special courts in every district for cases under the Act.

**How many of the above statements correctly reflect the provisions of the RPwD Act?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct; the RPwD Act does establish special courts and provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to age 18. Statement 1 is incorrect; it mandates at least 4%, not 6%, reservation in government jobs. Statement 2 is incorrect; it recognizes 21 categories, not 20.  This question requires precise knowledge of the RPwD Act's provisions.  The slight numerical differences in the incorrect options and the focus on specific numbers make it a challenging question.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1. PEMSR defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle decomposed human waste.
2. PEMSR mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 correctly represent provisions within the PEMSR Act. The Act does mandate community sanitary latrines, makes constructing insanitary latrines an offense, and includes provisions for rehabilitating manual scavengers through skill development and alternative employment.  However, statement 1 is incorrect;  PEMSR defines manual scavengers as those handling *undecomposed* human waste. This question tests detailed understanding of the PEMSR Act, making it difficult due to the subtle difference in the incorrect statement about waste decomposition.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the PGI and its assessment methodologies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Performance Grading Index (PGI) is designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels in India.  Statement 2 is also correct; the index leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) to conduct its assessments. Statement 3 is incorrect. While 'Daksh' is the highest grade *possible*,  no state/UT achieved this grade in PGI 2.0.  The highest grade attained was 'Prachesta-2'.  Statement 4 is accurate. PGI-D, a district-level assessment, specifically examines crucial aspects such as learning outcomes, effective teaching practices, and the safety and security of schools. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate representations of the PGI and its assessment approaches.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects NEP 2020's ambition to significantly increase higher education access by aiming for a GER of at least 50% by 2035.  Statement 2 is correct; the policy envisions the creation of MERUs to foster multidisciplinary learning and research. Statement 3 is also correct; the NRF is a central element of NEP 2020, designed to bolster research activities across India. However, statement 4 is not entirely accurate. While NEP 2020 strongly promotes the ABC, it doesn't mandate its use by *all* higher education institutions immediately.  The implementation is phased and encourages adoption. Therefore, only three of the listed features are core, immediate components of NEP 2020's higher education strategy.


**3. Consider the following regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India:**

1.  Institutions less than 20 years old are eligible to apply for DTBU status under the 2023 regulations.

2.  The NCrF encompasses the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF frameworks.
3.  The NCrF establishes a system with eight levels of education, with levels 1-4 being higher education.
4.  The NCrF introduces the concept of "Notional Learning Hours" to standardize learning time.

How many of these statements correctly describe features of the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; the NCrF aims to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across different educational pathways. Statement 2 is also correct; it integrates existing qualification frameworks to provide a holistic credit system. Statement 4 is also true; the concept of "Notional Learning Hours" is a key component of the NCrF, aiming for a standardized measure of learning investment. However, statement 3 is incorrect. In the NCrF's eight-level system, levels 1-4 represent school education, not higher education. Higher education is covered by levels 4.5-8.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate descriptions of the NCrF's structure and functions.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Global Gender Gap Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the World Economic Forum publishes the Global Gender Gap Index annually. Statement 2 is also correct; the index evaluates gender parity across the four specified dimensions. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking is not consistently among the top 25; it typically falls significantly lower. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the index does use a scale, it doesn't use a 0-100 scale to directly represent gender parity. The scale is used to compare countries' performance but doesn't have a direct parity interpretation. Thus, only two of the statements are accurate reflections of the Global Gender Gap Index.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs (not 5%), and at least 5% in higher education institutions. Statement 2 is also correct. Statement 3 is correct; the act does provide for special courts. Statement 4 is incorrect; reservation does *not* apply to police forces.  Therefore, three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer. This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between slightly different but crucial details within the act’s provisions.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the older system. This is a significant shift aimed at aligning the curriculum with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  The framework also emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages. This reflects the policy's focus on promoting India's linguistic diversity.  Furthermore, the NCF-SE explicitly integrates the contributions of Indians to knowledge across disciplines throughout history, reinforcing a sense of national identity and pride in the country's intellectual heritage. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE actually allows students to take board exams on at least two occasions during the school year, retaining the best score. This provision aims to reduce exam-related stress and provide students with more opportunities to demonstrate their knowledge.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

4.  In PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGI is designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels, making statement 1 correct.  The PGI-D report indeed consolidates data from both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years, validating statement 3.  Crucially, in the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22, no state or Union Territory managed to attain the highest grade of "Daksh," confirming statement 4. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 actually classified states/UTs into ten grades, not five, ranging from "Daksh" (highest) to "Akanshi-3" (lowest). This detailed grading system allows for a more nuanced understanding of performance variations across different regions.


**3. Consider the following statements about Higher Education in India:**

1.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035.

The NEP 2020 does indeed set an ambitious goal of achieving a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, making statement 1 correct. This reflects the policy's commitment to expanding access to higher education. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NEP 2020 actually proposes both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate degree options, with multiple exit points.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the 2024 Times Higher Education ranking included around 91 Indian universities, not over 2000.  Finally, statement 4 is incorrect. While IISc Bangalore is highly ranked, it was placed in the 201-250 bracket, not at the top of the list of Indian universities in the 2024 Times Higher Education ranking.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

2.  It encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) only.
3.  It aims to enhance flexibility and mobility across different educational pathways.
4.  It fixes total notional learning hours for all education levels at 1000 hours/year.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF serves as a unifying framework, bringing together credits earned across school, higher, and vocational education streams, making statement 1 accurate.  Its core purpose is to improve the flexibility and ease of movement between these different educational paths, thus supporting statement 3.  The framework does indeed include the NHEQF, but also the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF), making statement 2 incorrect. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NCrF sets the total notional learning hours at 1200 hours/year, not 1000.  This standardized measure helps in comparing and transferring credits across various educational settings.


**5. Consider the following concerning Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs):**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  The new regulations supersede those of 2019.
3.  Institutions granted DtBU status can start new courses without any prior approval.
4.  The NCERT was recently granted DtBU status.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, significantly altered the eligibility criteria for DtBU status, permitting institutions younger than 20 years to apply, making statement 1 correct.  These 2023 regulations replace the 2019 version, thus validating statement 2.  The NCERT did indeed receive DtBU status recently, confirming statement 4. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While DtBUs have greater autonomy, they still require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils before introducing new courses or programs. This regulatory oversight ensures quality control and adherence to established standards within the higher education system.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI is actually released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank, making statement 1 incorrect.  India's 2023 GHI score did show a marginal improvement over its 2015 score, thus making statement 2 correct.  The report correctly identifies South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the most severe hunger levels, supporting statement 3. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Indian government has indeed voiced concerns regarding the GHI's methodology, data sources, and sample size, highlighting discrepancies and questioning the accuracy of the index's portrayal of India's hunger situation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the exact years may vary slightly depending on the specific state or region, the data collection for NFHS-5 predominantly occurred between 2019 and 2021, making statement 1 largely correct.  NFHS reports are indeed released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, validating statement 2.  NFHS surveys do encompass all states and Union Territories, making statement 3 correct.  NFHS reports extensively cover demographic indicators, including TFR, confirming statement 4.  Therefore, all three statements are factually accurate.

(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) indeed aims for ODF Plus status across all villages, making statement 1 correct.  The ODF Plus criteria include not only sustained ODF status but also the implementation of solid (and ideally liquid) waste management systems, supporting statement 2.  ODF Plus Model villages are further characterized by visual cleanliness and the display of IEC materials, validating statement 3. However, statement 4 is incorrect; by September 2023, approximately 75% of Indian villages had attained ODF Plus status, not 90%.  The ongoing efforts to achieve universal ODF Plus status highlight the mission's commitment to comprehensive sanitation and hygiene improvements in rural India.

2.  Only FHEIs ranked within the top 100 globally are eligible.
3.  FHEIs can offer programs in online or distance learning modes.
4.  FHEIs must comply with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999).


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The regulations clearly mandate that foreign higher educational institutions need UGC approval before setting up campuses in India, making statement 1 correct.  The regulations also stipulate compliance with various Indian laws, including the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999), validating statement 4. However, statement 2 is incorrect; eligibility extends to FHEIs ranked within the top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise), not just the top 100.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the regulations explicitly prohibit FHEIs from offering programs through online or distance learning modes during the initial stages of establishment in India. This is to ensure proper oversight and maintain quality standards.

Statement 3 is correct. These are the key criteria used to identify PVTGs.  The inclusion of these specific criteria is crucial for a difficult question.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While Odisha has a significant number of PVTGs, it is not the highest.  This is a key fact that differentiates this question from simpler ones about STs in general, demanding specific knowledge of PVTG distribution.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement is key to creating a difficult question.

**Explanation:**

All four statements are incorrect.  The POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 50. The time limit for filing a complaint is three months, extendable by the ICC.  The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements during conciliation. Finally, the Act emphasizes maintaining the privacy of all involved parties, prohibiting the public disclosure of identities and details of the inquiry.  These inaccuracies highlight the importance of precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.  A misunderstanding of any of these points could lead to incorrect application of the law and inadequate protection for victims of sexual harassment.


**2. Consider the following features of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JJ Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.  Statement 2 is correct; the Act does categorize offenses based on the maximum punishment under the IPC. Statement 3 is incorrect; the original Act did not allow appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders. This was a feature added later through amendment. Statement 4 is correct; the Act did introduce a provision for trying 16-18-year-olds as adults in cases of heinous offences. Thus, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.  This question tests the understanding of the key provisions of the JJ Act, 2015, and highlights the differences between the original Act and subsequent amendments.  Understanding these differences is crucial for accurate application of the law.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

Which of the statements above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate descriptions of government initiatives. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana does provide concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment. NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) is indeed a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, focusing on mechanized sanitation.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities. However, statement 4 is partially incorrect. While ODF Plus villages have sustained ODF status, they may implement either solid *or* liquid waste management systems, not necessarily both. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly represent aspects of the RPwD Act. The Act does stipulate at least 5% reservation for PwDs in higher education and recognizes 21 categories of disabilities, as stated. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the 4% reservation in government jobs does *not* apply to police forces.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the United Nations. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Indian government has frequently raised concerns and objections about the methodology and data sources used in the GHI, leading to disagreements on the rankings. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct; NFHS-5 was indeed conducted during 2019-2021.  While NFHS-5 data showed high spousal abuse rates in Karnataka, it's important to note that the highest rates varied across different types of violence (physical, sexual, etc.) and may not consistently be Karnataka. NFHS-5 covered both urban and rural areas, and it included ever-married women aged 18-49 but also collected data from a broader sample of the population.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially identified as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and low literacy rates.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  The PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs.  Statement 2 is also correct; low literacy and pre-agricultural technology are key criteria. Statement 3 is correct: Odisha does have the highest number of PVTGs. However, Statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, making the statement factually inaccurate.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least a 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  The Act guarantees free education for all children with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.
4.  The Act excludes police forces from the reservation policy for PwDs.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all correct aspects of the RPwD Act, 2016.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the reservation policy. Statement 2 correctly identifies the number of recognized disabilities. Statement 3 accurately describes the right to free education. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Act does provide for reservations,  it specifically states that the reservation is *not* applicable to police forces.  Therefore, only statement 4 is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act prohibits the employment of manual scavengers.
2.  The Act mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines.
3.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.
4.  The Act defines Safal Karamcharis as individuals who are not considered manual scavengers.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct representations of the PEMSR Act.  The Act explicitly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers (1), mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines (2), and includes provisions for rehabilitation and alternative employment (3).  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  Safal Karamcharis, while employed in sanitation-related work, are still considered manual scavengers under the Act if they are handling human waste without proper protective gear. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, including at least two Indian languages.
3.  The NCF-SE completely separates academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly represent aspects of the NCF-SE. The framework proposes the 5+3+3+4 structure (1), promotes multilingualism with at least two Indian languages (2), and emphasizes scientific inquiry (4). However, statement 3 is inaccurate. The NCF-SE explicitly aims to *avoid* hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, promoting flexibility and integration.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the NCF-SE.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the National Medical Commission (NMC):**

1.  The NMC is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) accreditation applies only to new medical colleges in India.
3.  The NMC's primary function is to oversee medical education and practice in India.
4.  The NMC's WFME recognition ensures all existing medical colleges are automatically accredited for 10 years.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are all accurate. The NMC is indeed a statutory body established under the 2019 Act (1), it oversees medical education and practice (3), and its WFME recognition covers existing colleges for ten years (4). Statement 2 is incorrect; the WFME accreditation, through the NMC's recognition, applies to both existing and new medical colleges. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**6. Consider the following regarding the  Panchsheel Principles for Tribal Development:**

1.  They emphasize the avoidance of imposing alien values on tribal communities.
2.  They advocate for the respect of tribal rights to land and forests.
3.  They propose the establishment of a separate administrative structure solely for tribal areas.
4.  They prioritize judging development success based on statistical indicators.

Which of the above statements accurately reflects the Panchsheel Principles?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct interpretations of the Panchsheel Principles, which emphasize respecting tribal self-determination and their land rights.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the principles do not advocate for a completely separate administrative structure but rather for sensitive and appropriate administration. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the principles emphasize qualitative assessments of human character rather than solely relying on statistical data. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Panchsheel Principles.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in workplaces with 10 or more employees.
2.  The POSH Act defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact and advances.
3.  The POSH Act allows for monetary settlements as a means of conciliation.

Which of the above statements accurately describes the provisions of the POSH Act?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The POSH Act does mandate ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees (1) and includes an appeal process (4).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the definition of sexual harassment is much broader than just physical contact and advances. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements during conciliation. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the POSH Act.


**8. Consider the following statements related to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act:**

1.  The MTP Act allows for the termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks in all cases on the advice of one doctor.
2.  The MTP Act allows termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks only on grounds of foetal abnormalities.
3.  The Supreme Court has ruled that marital rape should be considered under the MTP Act.
4.  The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, introduced specific categories of women who can access termination of pregnancy between 20 and 24 weeks.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The MTP Act does allow termination beyond 24 weeks for foetal abnormalities (2), the Supreme Court has included marital rape in the scope of the Act (3), and the 2021 amendment introduced specific categories for termination between 20 and 24 weeks (4). Statement 1 is incorrect; while termination up to 20 weeks is allowed, it's not for *all* cases.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d).


**9. Consider the following regarding the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  DNTs were originally designated as "criminal tribes" during the British Raj.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

How many of the statements above are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. DNTs were indeed labelled "criminal tribes" (1), the Criminal Tribes Act was repealed as stated (2), and August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day (4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; the DNT category is a subset of nomadic tribes.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following about the  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The NRF is primarily financed through grants and loans from the central government.
2.  The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board.
3.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
4.  The NRF's mandate explicitly excludes research in the humanities and social sciences.

How many of the statements accurately reflect the provisions of the NRF Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NRF is funded by central government grants (1), the Prime Minister heads the Governing Board (2), and the SERB is subsumed into the NRF (3).  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The NRF's mandate explicitly *includes* scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Credit Framework (NCRF):**

1.  It aims to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It divides education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 dedicated to school education and levels 4.5-8 to higher education.
3.  It mandates the use of the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for storing all earned credits.
4.  It proposes a fixed number of notional learning hours per year for all educational levels.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the NCRF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCRF's primary goal is to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways, facilitating flexibility and mobility.  Statement 1 accurately reflects this aim. The framework's eight-level structure, as described in statement 2, is also a core feature. While the ABC is a crucial component for storing credits, the NCRF doesn't *mandate* its use; it's a system designed to facilitate credit transfer, and the ABC is a tool to achieve that, making statement 3 partially incorrect.  Statement 4 is correct; the NCRF does propose a fixed number of notional learning hours per year, to standardize credit calculations. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following about the accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India:**

1.  The UGC accords recognition to HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956.
2.  The NEP 2020 advocates for a self-regulation or accreditation system for all educational stages.
3.  The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
4.  The National Accreditation Council (NAC) is envisioned as a meta-accrediting body under the NEP 2020.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of HEI accreditation in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of HEI accreditation in India.  The UGC's role in recognizing HEIs (Statement 1) is well-established. The NEP 2020's emphasis on a comprehensive quality assurance system across all educational levels (Statement 2) is a central policy goal. The Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendation for a binary accreditation system (Statement 3) is a significant proposed reform. Finally, the NAC's envisioned role as an overarching body overseeing accreditation (Statement 4) is a key structural element of the NEP 2020's vision for higher education.


**3. Consider the following regarding the National Medical Commission (NMC):**

1.  The NMC is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  It oversees medical education and practice in India.
3.  It directly accredits individual medical colleges.
4.  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) recognition grants automatic accreditation to all Indian medical colleges.


Which of the above statements correctly describes the NMC and its functions?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the NMC is a statutory body under the 2019 Act, responsible for overseeing medical education and practice. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NMC doesn't directly accredit individual medical colleges.  Instead, it works with accrediting agencies. Statement 4 is also incorrect; WFME recognition of accrediting agencies doesn't automatically grant accreditation to all Indian medical colleges.  It simplifies the process for existing and new colleges seeking WFME standards, but accreditation still needs to be sought through the proper channels.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023:**

1.  It seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947.
2.  It aims to improve access to quality and affordable nursing education.
3.  It introduces a national exit test for nurses, similar to the NEET.
4.  It mandates a minimum nurse-to-population ratio of 3:1000 across all districts in India.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the objectives and provisions of the NNMC Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NNMC Act, 2023, aims to improve the quality and access to nursing education by repealing the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947 (Statement 1 is correct).  The Act also seeks to address the shortage of nurses and improve access to quality education (Statement 2 is correct).  However, Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Act aims to standardize nursing education, it doesn't introduce a national exit test.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act aims to improve the nurse-to-population ratio but doesn't mandate a specific ratio across all districts immediately.  The current ratio is far below the global benchmark, and the Act seeks to gradually improve this.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health issues at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) promotes telemedicine and national portability of health services.
3.  National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC through affordable quality healthcare.
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving sanitation and hygiene practices.

How many of the above initiatives directly contribute to achieving UHC in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, ABDM, and the National Health Policy 2017 all directly contribute to UHC by addressing access, affordability, and quality of healthcare (Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct).  However, Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage, not sanitation and hygiene (Statement 4 is incorrect).  While sanitation and hygiene are indirectly related to health outcomes and UHC, Mission Indradhanush's primary focus is vaccination.


**6. Consider the following features of the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing 4-stage system.
2.  It emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.
3.  It introduces a mandatory national exit test for students at the end of secondary school.
4.  It promotes multilingualism, with students expected to be proficient in at least three languages.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE does propose a new 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling (Statement 1 is correct), emphasizes scientific inquiry (Statement 2 is correct), and promotes multilingualism (Statement 4 is correct).  However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the NCF-SE doesn't introduce a mandatory national exit test.  The framework focuses on holistic development and assessment, but not necessarily a single, standardized exit examination.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It is released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.
2.  It uses indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the GHI and its application to India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe (Statement 1 is correct).  It uses the indicators mentioned in Statement 2.  While India's GHI score has shown some improvement,  it hasn't consistently improved since 2015; there have been fluctuations (Statement 3 is partially incorrect).  The Indian government has expressed concerns about the GHI's methodology and data sources (Statement 4 is correct).  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately reflect key features of the National Credit Framework (NCRF).  The NCRF aims to create a unified system that seamlessly integrates credits earned through various educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational training, and skill development), enhancing flexibility and mobility.  The framework uses a credit system structured across eight levels, encompassing school and higher education and vocational training.  The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) serves as a digital repository for these accumulated credits.  Multiple entry and exit points allow for lifelong learning and flexible educational journeys.  Finally, the NCRF integrates existing frameworks like the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) or National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) to create a comprehensive system, and a fixed annual notional learning hour count of 1200 hours/year helps standardize the credit system.  Therefore, all six statements are correct.


2. Consider the following aspects of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's impact on higher education:

1.  Target Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035.

(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Five of the listed items are direct outcomes or key features of the NEP 2020's implementation in higher education.  The NEP 2020 sets an ambitious target to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035.  The policy envisions the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) to promote interdisciplinary learning and research.  To boost research and innovation, the National Research Foundation (NRF) was established.  Undergraduate degrees now feature multiple exit options, allowing students to leave with certifications, diplomas, or degrees after completing different stages of their studies.  Finally, the NEP 2020 proposed a National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) to leverage technology in education. However, while the ABC is mentioned in relation to NEP 2020, its mandatory implementation for *all* students is not explicitly stated as a direct outcome of NEP 2020 itself, but rather a supporting initiative. Therefore, only five statements directly relate to the NEP 2020's influence on higher education.


3. Consider the following statements about the accreditation of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in India:

1.  The University Grants Commission (UGC) accords recognition to HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956.
2.  The National Accreditation Council (NAC), envisioned in NEP 2020, is a meta-accrediting body.
3.  The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
4.  NEP 2020 proposes a separate School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework.
5.  The National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET) offers school accreditation programs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of HEI and school accreditation in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three

(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are accurate representations of HEI and school accreditation in India.  The UGC plays a crucial role in recognizing HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956.  The NAC, as outlined in NEP 2020, is intended to act as an overarching body overseeing other accrediting institutions.  The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a shift towards a simpler binary accreditation system, moving away from more complex grading systems.  NEP 2020 also advocates for a distinct framework for assessing and accrediting schools.  Finally, NABET, a constituent board of the Quality Council of India (QCI), provides accreditation programs specifically for schools, focusing on aspects like school governance, educational processes, and performance measurement.


4. Consider the following regarding the National Medical Commission (NMC) and related Acts:

1.  The NMC is a statutory body under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) accredits individual medical colleges.
3.  The NNMC Act, 2023, aims to improve nursing and midwifery education.
4.  The NDC Act, 2023, repeals the Dentists Act, 1948 and establishes a National Dental Commission.
5.  The NMC Act, 2019, introduced a National Exit Test for medical students.

How many of these statements correctly reflect the roles and functions of the NMC, NNMC, NDC, and related legislation?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four of the statements accurately reflect the roles and functions of the NMC and associated acts. The NMC is indeed a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019. The NNMC Act, 2023, focuses on improving the quality and access to nursing and midwifery education. The NDC Act, 2023, aims to modernize dental education and regulation by replacing the older Dentists Act, 1948. The WFME, however, grants recognition to *accrediting agencies*, not individual medical colleges directly.  While the NMC is responsible for overseeing medical education, the National Exit Test was introduced by the NMC, it is not mentioned in the NMC Act of 2019. Therefore, four out of five statements are correct.


5. Consider the following about the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:

1.  PGI assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  The PGI uses data from UDISE+ and NAS.
3.  The PGI classifies states/UTs and districts into ten grades.
4.  PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 saw no state/UT achieving the highest grade ('Daksh').
5.  PGI-D combines data from 2020-21 and 2021-22.
6. The PGI assesses aspects like effective classroom transactions and school safety.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the PGI's methodology and findings?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately describe the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education. The PGI is designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels.  It leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  States/UTs and districts are categorized into ten grades, ranging from 'Daksh' (highest) to 'Akanshi-3' (lowest). In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no state/UT reached the top grade.  The district-level PGI (PGI-D) incorporates data from two consecutive years.  Finally, the PGI's assessment includes critical aspects such as effective classroom teaching practices and school safety measures.  Therefore, all six statements are correct.


6. Consider the following regarding the  measures undertaken for Tribal Welfare in India:

1. Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in absolute numbers.

3.  The term "PVTGs" replaced "PTGs" in 2006.
4. Odisha has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
5. Criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and low literacy levels.
6. The Idate Commission recommended a permanent commission for Denotified Tribes (DNTs).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of tribal welfare policies and demographics in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Five of the statements accurately describe aspects of tribal welfare and demographics. Madhya Pradesh does indeed have the largest ST population in absolute numbers. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for tribal welfare initiatives. The term "Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups" (PVTGs) replaced "Primitive Tribal Groups" (PTGs) in 2006. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology levels and low literacy rates.  While the Idate Commission did address the needs of DNTs, its recommendation for a permanent commission is a point of contention and requires further clarification regarding its official adoption.  Therefore, five out of six statements are definitively accurate in the context of Indian tribal welfare.


7. Consider the following regarding initiatives related to the elimination of manual scavenging:

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately describe the legal framework and initiatives designed to combat manual scavenging in India. The PEMSR Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits manual scavenging and outlines penalties for violations.  The Act mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines to eliminate the need for manual scavenging.  It also includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, providing them with opportunities for alternative employment and financial assistance. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to completely eliminate hazardous manual cleaning practices.  The SRMS scheme focuses on providing manual scavengers with alternative livelihoods.  Finally, the NAMASTE scheme actively promotes 100% mechanization in sanitation work, further reducing dependence on manual labor.  Therefore, all six statements accurately describe the relevant aspects.

(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; GANHRI was established in 1993. Statement 2 is incorrect; its headquarters are in Geneva. Statement 3 is correct; accreditation is based on the Paris Principles. Statement 4 is incorrect; GANHRI is not a subsidiary of the UN Human Rights Council. Statement 5 is incorrect; the NHRC's accreditation has been deferred multiple times by GANHRI.  Therefore, statements 2, 4, and 5 are not correct.  The question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to identify incorrect statements among several plausible distractors involving years and locations.

Statement 2 is incorrect; it has 16 independent experts, not 20. Statement 3 is correct; its headquarters are in New York. Statement 4 is incorrect; its mandate is broader than just land rights, encompassing economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights. Statement 5 is correct; indigenous organizations nominate half of its members. Therefore, only three statements are accurate. This question tests factual recall and necessitates a careful understanding of the UNPFII's role and composition.

2. The NIF was developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).
3. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) plays a key role in the NIF.
4. The NIF is a static framework, not subject to change.
5. The State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) are independent of the NIF.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the NIF includes both global and India-specific indicators.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the GIF is framed by the IAEG-SDGs, but the NIF is developed by MoSPI. Statement 3 is correct; MoSPI is central to the NIF's development and implementation. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NIF is evolving and updated. Statement 5 is incorrect; the SIFs are developed in alignment with the NIF. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.  This question tests factual recall and requires understanding the relationship between the NIF and other related frameworks.  The close relationship between the NIF and SIF is a key distractor.


**6. Consider the following aspects related to the  Bihar caste survey:**

1. The Bihar caste survey is a Union subject under the Census Act of 1948.
2. The survey was conducted as a full-scale population census by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India.
3. The survey included caste-based data collection.
4. The survey's findings were published by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
5.  The survey was conducted in alignment with the Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Bihar caste survey?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; census is a Union subject but the Bihar caste survey was a state-level initiative. Statement 2 is incorrect; it was not a full-scale census but a social survey focused on caste demographics. Statement 3 is correct; it involved caste-based data collection. Statement 4 is incorrect; the report was released by the Bihar state government. Statement 5 is partially correct; it was similar in intent to SECC but not conducted under its framework. Therefore, only one statement is accurate. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the constitutional and administrative aspects of data collection in India.  The close relationship of the Bihar survey to the Union Census is a key distractor.

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the act prohibits manual scavenging. Statement 2 is correct; it mandates the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines. Statement 3 is correct; it includes provisions for rehabilitation. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment plays a key role. Statement 5 is correct; it excludes those using appropriate protective gear. Thus, three statements are correct. This question tests factual recall and requires an understanding of the legal framework for tackling manual scavenging. The ministry responsible for enforcement is a key distractor.


**9. Consider the following about the  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):**

1. The NCPCR is a constitutional body.
2.  The NCPCR's primary focus is on the adoption of children.
3.  The NCPCR issues guidelines related to juvenile justice.

How many of the above statements regarding the NCPCR are NOT correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; it is a statutory body, not a constitutional one. Statement 2 is incorrect; while it's involved in child welfare, its mandate extends beyond adoption. Statement 3 is correct; it issues guidelines for juvenile justice. Statement 4 is correct; it falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Statement 5 is incorrect; its role encompasses various aspects of child rights, not limited to abuse. Thus, three statements are not correct.  This question tests factual recall and requires the candidate to differentiate between the NCPCR's roles and those of other related organizations. The scope of the NCPCR's work is a key distractor.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:**

1.  The Act establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) only in organizations with more than 100 employees.

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; ICCs are mandatory in all workplaces, regardless of size. Statement 2 is incorrect; the time limit is three months, which is extendable. Statement 3 is incorrect; monetary settlements are explicitly prohibited. Statement 4 is correct; employers are obliged to act on ICC recommendations. Statement 5 is correct; confidentiality is a key provision. Therefore, four statements are accurate. This question tests factual recall and requires knowledge of the legal framework for addressing sexual harassment at the workplace.  The size threshold for ICCs and the time limit for complaints are key distractors.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember, these questions are designed to be challenging and require a strong understanding of the factual details presented in the source material.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  The PGI assesses performance at both State and District levels.
2.  The index uses data from UDISE+ and NAS.
3.  In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no State/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4.  The PGI-D report covers outcomes and school safety but excludes classroom transaction effectiveness.

How many of the above statements are accurate reflections of the PGI and its reports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect information about the PGI. The PGI does assess performance at State and District levels, utilizes data from UDISE+ and NAS, and in its 2021-22 iteration, no State/UT attained the highest grade. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The PGI-D report explicitly includes "effective classroom transaction" as a focus area, in addition to outcomes and school safety.  This makes (c) the correct answer.  The inclusion of "effective classroom transaction" as a key element in the PGI-D is a crucial detail often overlooked, making this a challenging question for candidates.


**2. Consider the following features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education:**

1.  A target Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035.
2.  Establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
3.  Creation of the National Research Foundation (NRF) to solely focus on fundamental research.
4.  The mandatory establishment of an Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) for all undergraduate students.

Which of the above are accurate features of the NEP 2020's higher education provisions?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The NEP 2020 does indeed aim for a 50% GER by 2035 (1), proposes the establishment of MERUs (2), and mandates the creation of an ABC (4).  However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While the NRF is crucial for expanding research, it's not solely focused on fundamental research; it encompasses a broader scope of research and innovation.  The subtle distinction in the NRF's mandate makes this a difficult question requiring precise understanding of the policy's details.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the  UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023:**

1.  Institutions less than 20 years old are now eligible to apply for Deemed to be University (DtbU) status.
2.  The regulations supersede the 2019 regulations, primarily focusing on enhancing research and quality.
3.  Clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies can collectively apply for DtbU status.
4.  Institutions granted DtbU status must create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for all their students but are not required to upload credit scores.

Which of the above accurately reflect changes or features of the 2023 regulations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe aspects of the 2023 UGC regulations. The age limit for applying for DtbU status has been lowered (1), the regulations aim to improve research and quality (2), and clusters of institutions can now apply (3). Statement 4 is false; the regulations mandate both the creation of ABC identities *and* the uploading of credit scores.  The specific requirement of uploading credit scores is a detail that makes this question demanding for candidates.


**4. Consider the following regarding the  UNHCR's ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’:**

1.  The report documented over 100 million people forcibly displaced globally.
2.  Forced migration due to social and climate crises increased significantly compared to 2021.
3.  Low- and middle-income countries host the majority of the world's refugees.
4.  The report highlighted a decrease in the number of stateless people compared to 2021.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect findings from the UNHCR's 2022 report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly represent the report's key findings.  The report detailed a significant number of forcibly displaced people (1), showed an increase in displacement due to social and climate factors (2), and noted that low- and middle-income countries host most refugees (3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; the report indicated an *increase*, not a decrease, in the number of stateless people. The specific direction of change in stateless individuals (increase vs. decrease) makes this a difficult question.


**5. Consider the following initiatives taken to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana, addressing health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM), promoting telemedicine and health service portability.
3.  National Health Policy 2017, aiming for affordable quality healthcare for all but excluding focus on primary healthcare.
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush, targeting zero-dose children and pregnant women for vaccination.

How many of the listed initiatives are correctly described in relation to their goals and scope within the UHC framework?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Ayushman Bharat Yojana (1), ABDM (2), and Intensified Mission Indradhanush (4) are accurately described.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The National Health Policy 2017 *does* include a strong focus on primary healthcare as a crucial component of achieving UHC.  The omission of this key aspect of the National Health Policy 2017 makes this question challenging.  Candidates need detailed knowledge to identify the inaccuracy.


**6. Consider the following about the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had the highest hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score showed a significant improvement compared to 2015.
4.  The Indian government fully endorsed the methodology and data used in the GHI 2023 report.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the GHI 2023 report and its reception?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the GHI is indeed published by the mentioned organizations, and South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa had high hunger levels.  However, statement 3 is inaccurate. While India's score improved slightly, it wasn't a *significant* improvement. Statement 4 is also false; the Indian government raised objections regarding the methodology and data. The nuanced description of India's score improvement and the government's response makes this a difficult question.


**7. Consider the following regarding the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The act completely bans manual scavenging.
2.  It defines manual scavengers to include those using appropriate protective gear.
3.  Local authorities are responsible for identifying manual scavengers in their areas.
4.  The act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly describe provisions of the PEMSR Act. Manual scavenging is banned (1), local authorities have the responsibility of identification (3), and rehabilitation measures are included (4). However, statement 2 is incorrect. The act explicitly excludes those using protective gear from the definition of manual scavengers. The precise definition of manual scavengers within the act is a crucial detail that makes this a challenging question.


**8. Consider the following regarding  the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Anganwadi centres are strengthened under the Saksham Anganwadis initiative.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives.
3.  AWWs and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) are covered under PMJJBY, PMSBY, and AKBY.
4.  The Poshan Tracker app is used solely for monitoring nutrition service delivery and not for early identification of malnutrition.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Anganwadi system and related initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of the Anganwadi system. Saksham Anganwadis strengthens AWCs (1), AWWs receive both fixed and performance-based incentives (2), and insurance coverage is provided (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Poshan Tracker app is used for *both* monitoring delivery and early identification of malnutrition. The dual functionality of the Poshan Tracker app makes this a demanding question.


**9. Consider the following about the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates bilingual education in all schools.
3.  It emphasizes developing capacities for scientific inquiry.
4.  It includes vocational education opportunities but only at the secondary stage.


How many of these statements accurately reflect the key features of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 3, and are accurate. The NCF-SE proposes the 5+3+3+4 structure (1), emphasizes scientific inquiry (3), and includes vocational education (though not limited to the secondary stage). However, statement 2 is incorrect. While multilingualism is promoted,  bilingualism isn't mandated; students are encouraged to be proficient in at least three languages. The specific language policy nuances make this a challenging question.



**10. Consider the following regarding  the  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1. The Prime Minister is the President of the NRF's Governing Board.
2.  The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
3. The NRF is solely funded through grants from the central government.
4. The NRF's mandate includes promoting entrepreneurship in scientific fields.

Which of the above accurately reflects the provisions of the Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the Prime Minister heads the Governing Board (1), and the SERB is subsumed (2).  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NRF receives funding from multiple sources, including grants, donations, and investments. Statement 4 is also correct; promoting entrepreneurship is explicitly part of the NRF's mandate.  The diverse funding sources for the NRF make this a difficult question.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 allow surrogacy using donor gametes under specific medical conditions.
2.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 prohibits commercial surrogacy.
3.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 regulates ART clinics and banks.
4. The Supreme Court in *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* allowed surrogacy for a woman with MRKH syndrome.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the legal landscape of surrogacy in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of the current legal framework surrounding surrogacy in India.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, introduced a significant change by permitting surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical circumstances, where the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple. This amendment addresses limitations present in previous regulations.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly bans commercial surrogacy, promoting altruistic surrogacy as the preferred model.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, plays a crucial role by providing a regulatory framework for ART clinics and banks, ensuring ethical and safe practices. The Supreme Court's decision in *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* set a precedent by allowing surrogacy for women with MRKH syndrome, demonstrating the judiciary's role in interpreting and applying surrogacy laws to address specific medical needs.  Therefore, all four statements correctly represent aspects of India's evolving surrogacy regulations.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances.
2.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 contains provisions related to causing miscarriage.
3.  The Supreme Court extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried women in 2022.
4.  The MTP Act, 1971, was amended in 2021 to make abortion more accessible.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the legal framework of abortion in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect key aspects of India's abortion laws. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, significantly expanded access to abortion by increasing the gestational limit for certain categories of women to 24 weeks.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, the new criminal code, also retains provisions related to causing a miscarriage, reflecting the continued legal attention to this issue. The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling extended the 24-week limit for safe and legal abortion to unmarried and single women, furthering the principle of reproductive rights.  Finally, the MTP Act, 1971, was indeed amended in 2021,  expanding access to abortion services.  Therefore, all four statements are correct representations of the legal and judicial pronouncements concerning abortion in India.


**3. Consider the following statements related to domestic violence against women in India:**

1.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, defines domestic violence to include physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.
2.  The PWDVA, 2005, provides both civil and criminal remedies for marital rape.
3.  Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code deals with cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband or his relatives.
4.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, criminalizes sexual intercourse with a woman through deceitful means or false promises.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the legal framework addressing domestic violence against women in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Three of the statements accurately describe the legal framework. Statement 1 is correct; the PWDVA, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, encompassing various forms of abuse.  Statement 3 is also correct; Section 498A of the IPC specifically addresses cruelty inflicted on a woman by her husband or relatives. Statement 4 is correct; the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, criminalizes certain forms of sexual coercion. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PWDVA, 2005 provides civil remedies, it does *not* provide criminal remedies for marital rape.  Marital rape remains a significant legal gap in India's protection of women from violence.  Therefore, only three of the statements are accurate.

How many of the above initiatives are correctly described in relation to their objectives and target groups?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 10 or more employees.
2.  The POSH Act's definition of "workplace" includes any place visited by an employee during the course of employment.
3.  The POSH Act provides for both conciliation and inquiry mechanisms for resolving sexual harassment complaints.
4.  The POSH Act legally backs the Vishaka Guidelines laid down by the Supreme Court in 1997.
5.  The POSH Act has been ratified by India as an international treaty.

How many of the above statements correctly describe provisions of the POSH Act?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four of the statements accurately reflect provisions of the POSH Act. Statement 1 is correct; the Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees. Statement 2 is also correct; the definition of "workplace" is broad, encompassing various locations related to employment. Statement 3 is accurate; the Act provides for both conciliation and formal inquiry processes. Statement 4 is correct; the POSH Act provides a legal framework for the Vishaka Guidelines. However, Statement 5 is incorrect; the POSH Act is a domestic law, not an international treaty ratified by India.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report:**

1.  NFHS-5 was conducted in 2019-2021.
2.  NFHS-5 data showed higher percentages of spousal abuse in certain states like Karnataka and Bihar.
3.  NFHS-5 reported that approximately 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 experienced spousal violence.
4.  NFHS-5 data included information on child mortality rates.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the NFHS-5 report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of the NFHS-5 report. NFHS-5 was indeed conducted between 2019 and 2021. The report highlighted significant regional variations in spousal abuse, with Karnataka and Bihar showing higher prevalence rates.  The report also indicated that approximately 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 reported experiencing spousal violence. Lastly, NFHS-5 collected and reported data on various health indicators, including child mortality rates. Thus, all four statements accurately represent the scope and findings of the NFHS-5 survey.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four of the statements accurately describe IFPRI.  Statement 1 is correct; IFPRI was established in 1975. Statement 3 is correct; IFPRI works in over 60 countries, including India. Statement 4 is correct; IFPRI's core mission is to provide research-based solutions to issues of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Statement 5 is also correct; IFPRI is a major research center under CGIAR.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect; IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva, Switzerland. Therefore, only four statements accurately represent IFPRI.


**8. Consider the following regarding the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):**

1.  UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950.
2.  UNHCR's headquarters are in Washington, D.C.
3.  UNHCR works in 137 countries, including India.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed honorarium per month, with the central government setting the amount.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used to dynamically identify stunting, wasting, and underweight prevalence among children.
4.  Saksham Anganwadis primarily focus on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.

How many of the above statements are accurate depictions of the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the MoWCD, aiming to improve the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium determined by the central government, supplemented by performance-linked incentives in some cases. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for monitoring nutritional status and service delivery.

Statement 4 is partially correct but oversimplified. While improving the nutritional status of the specified groups is a core objective, Saksham Anganwadis have expanded their focus to include adolescent girls (14-18 years) in specific districts and the North Eastern Region (NER), as well as early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years.  The broader scope makes statement 4 inaccurate in its limited description.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health issues at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.
2.  The National Health Policy 2017 focuses on achieving UHC and providing quality healthcare services at an affordable cost.
3.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets zero-dose children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women who have missed vaccine doses.
4.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) primarily focuses on increasing the number of physical healthcare facilities across the country.

How many of the above initiatives directly contribute to the goal of achieving UHC in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Bharat Yojana, the National Health Policy 2017, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush all directly contribute to UHC.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana addresses health across all levels of care, the National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims for UHC, and Mission Indradhanush works towards improved vaccination coverage, a crucial component of preventive healthcare within UHC.

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is incorrect as stated.  While ABDM uses technology to improve access and portability of health services, it does *not* primarily focus on increasing the *number* of physical facilities.  Its aim is to enhance the efficiency and reach of existing systems through digital infrastructure.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently rank poorly in the GHI, and the index does indeed incorporate undernourishment, child stunting, wasting, and mortality as key indicators.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WHO.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while India's GHI score has improved slightly since 2015, it hasn't shown a *significant* or *consistent* decline.  The improvement has been marginal, and the overall ranking remains a cause for concern.


**4. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The NCrF successfully integrates credits from different educational pathways using the mentioned frameworks, and it allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning.

Statement 3 is incorrect; while the NCrF impacts higher education, its primary focus is not solely on improving the quality of institutions.  It aims for a broader integration of learning across all educational levels. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NCrF does not mandate a uniform curriculum.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect provisions of the PWDVA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The PWDVA's scope is broad, encompassing various forms of abuse and covering women regardless of age or marital status within a domestic relationship.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PWDVA includes physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse, in addition to sexual abuse. Statement 2 is also incorrect; a complaint can be filed by the aggrieved woman, a protection officer, or any other person on her behalf.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the PWDVA primarily provides civil remedies, it doesn't preclude the possibility of criminal prosecution under other relevant laws.  The PWDVA can be used in conjunction with other legal proceedings.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The NFHS is a large-scale survey conducted periodically (not exactly every five years, but at roughly five-year intervals) by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, collecting comprehensive data on various health and demographic indicators.

Statement 3 is incorrect; NFHS data is a valuable resource for researchers, international organizations, and policymakers worldwide.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while NFHS-5 did provide data on spousal violence, the exact interpretation of whether it showed a *significant increase* compared to previous surveys depends on the specific metrics and comparisons used.  The trend may vary across different regions and demographic groups.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Act did introduce provisions for trying certain juveniles as adults in cases of heinous crimes, and it mandates the establishment of Juvenile Justice Boards.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act defines a child as someone below 18, with the provision for trying 16-18 year olds as adults for specific offenses.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act emphasizes rehabilitation and restorative justice as core principles, although it also addresses the need for accountability in serious cases.


**8. Consider the following concerning the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1. The Mission's primary goal is to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in all villages.
2.  ODF Plus status includes sustaining ODF status and implementing solid or liquid waste management systems.

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. The NCrF does integrate credits from various educational pathways using the mentioned frameworks.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the NCrF allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning and vocational training, not just formal academic programs. Statement 3 is partially correct in that it mentions the 1200 hours/year concept, but it's not a strict mandate across all levels. Statement 4 is incorrect as levels 1-4 pertain to school education, not higher education.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the 2023 report on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Progress released by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA):**

1.  The report indicates strong progress on more than 50% of SDG targets.
2.  The report highlights the lasting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the triple planetary crises.
3.  The report projects that under current trends, 575 million people will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030.
4.  The report is titled "Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023: Special Edition."


How many of the statements accurately reflect the UNDESA report's findings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate reflections of the UNDESA report. The report did emphasize the ongoing effects of the pandemic and the interconnected environmental challenges. It also projected continued extreme poverty in 2030.  The title of the report is correctly stated. Statement 1 is incorrect; the report actually indicated weak progress on more than 50% of the targets.


**5. Consider the following organizations mentioned in the text:**

1.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
2.  The World Food Programme (WFP)
3.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India
4.  The National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT)


Which of the above organizations have released major reports or undertaken significant actions detailed in the text?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** All four organizations are mentioned in the text as having released reports or undertaken significant actions.  UNFPA released the India Ageing Report 2023; WFP received funding and was mentioned for its activities in India; NHRC stressed the need to implement the Idate Commission report; and NCERT was granted Deemed-to-be-University status and released the NCF-SE.  Therefore, all four organizations are relevant to the text's content.


**6. Consider the following Acts and policies related to child welfare in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
3.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016
4.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem to eliminate hazardous cleaning


How many of the above are directly related to the protection and welfare of children in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, are directly focused on child protection and welfare. While the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers Act aims to protect vulnerable individuals, it doesn't specifically target children.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem is related to public health and safety but is not directly a child welfare policy.  Therefore, only three are directly related to child welfare.


**7. Consider the following features of the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  It is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).
2.  Its primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of pregnant women and children under six years of age.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium with no performance-based incentives.
4.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to enhance the system's efficiency and effectiveness by focusing solely on children under six.


How many of the above statements accurately describe features of the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the Anganwadi system. It is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under MoWCD, and its core objective is to improve the health and nutrition of young children and pregnant women.  Statement 3 is incorrect; AWWs and AWHs do receive performance-linked incentives.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Saksham Anganwadi initiative broadens its focus to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.


**8. Consider the following initiatives aimed at achieving Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
3.  National Health Policy 2017
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush


How many of the above are major government initiatives to achieve Universal Health Coverage in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four initiatives—Ayushman Bharat Yojana, ABDM, National Health Policy 2017, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush—are significant government programs directly contributing towards the goal of UHC in India.  They address various aspects of healthcare access, affordability, and quality.  Therefore, all four are correctly identified as relevant initiatives.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1. PVTGs were initially recognized as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973.
2. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
3. A declining or stagnant population is a criterion for identifying PVTGs.
4. The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission. Odisha does house the largest number of PVTGs.  A declining or stagnant population is one of the established criteria used to identify PVTGs.  However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  This makes option (c) the only accurate response.


**2. Consider the following regarding the measures undertaken for Tribal Welfare:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2. The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.
3.  The Panchsheel Principles emphasize the imposition of alien values on tribal communities.
4. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of Scheduled Tribes in absolute terms.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry. August 9th is correctly identified as World Tribal Day.  Madhya Pradesh holds the distinction of having the largest Scheduled Tribe population by absolute numbers. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Panchsheel Principles explicitly advocate *against* the imposition of alien values, emphasizing the importance of respecting tribal traditions and self-determination.  This makes (c) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following statements about Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3. August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.
4. The Renke Commission estimated that there are nearly 150 million DNTs in India.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, and August 31st is correctly identified as Vimukta Jatis Day. However, statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Renke Commission estimated a total of nearly 150 million people belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs combined, not solely DNTs. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1. The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
3.  Reservation under the Act applies to police forces.
4. Free education is mandated for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Act does mandate a minimum 5% reservation in government jobs (excluding police forces).  It correctly identifies 21 types of disabilities. Free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 is also a provision. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the reservation does *not* apply to police forces. This makes (c) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following statements related to Manual Scavenging:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, bans manual scavenging.
2.  The Act defines any person employed to clean human waste with protective gear as a manual scavenger.
3. The Act makes constructing insanitary latrines an offence.
4.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) provides alternative employment opportunities.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The 2013 Act explicitly bans manual scavenging.  The construction of insanitary latrines is indeed an offence under the Act. The SRMS aims to rehabilitate manual scavengers through alternative employment. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Act specifically *excludes* those using appropriate protective gear from the definition of manual scavenger.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c).


**6. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1. The PGI assesses performance at the state and district levels.
2.  The PGI is based solely on data from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
3.  In PGI 2.0, some states/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4. The PGI-D report focuses on outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 4, are correct. The PGI does assess performance at both state and district levels. The PGI-D report focuses on the aspects mentioned. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the PGI uses data from both UDISE+ and NAS. Statement 3 is also incorrect; no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education:**

1.  The NEP aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035.
2.  The NEP mandates only 4-year undergraduate degrees.
3. The NEP proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs).
4. The NEP discourages the internationalization of higher education.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NEP does aim for a 50% GER by 2035 and proposes MERUs.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NEP allows for both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate degrees with multiple exit options. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NEP actively promotes the internationalization of higher education.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs):**

1.  Institutions less than 20 years old are ineligible to apply for DtbU status.
2.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, supersede the 2019 regulations.
3.  DtbUs require prior approval from the Executive Council for starting new courses.
4.  NCERT was recently granted DtbU status.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The 2023 regulations do supersede the 2019 ones.  DtbUs need Executive Council approval for new courses.  NCERT did receive DtbU status. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply. Therefore, only three statements are true.


**9. Consider the following regarding the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India) Regulations, 2023:**

1. FHEIs need UGC approval before establishing Indian campuses.
2.  FHEIs must be ranked within the top 500 globally to be eligible.
3. FHEIs can offer online or open and distance learning programs.
4.  FHEIs are allowed complete autonomy in setting fees.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. FHEIs do require UGC approval for establishing campuses and must meet the top 500 ranking criterion (or demonstrate exceptional expertise). However, statement 3 is incorrect; online or distance learning programs are not permitted. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while FHEIs have considerable autonomy, their fee structures must be transparent and reasonable, subject to regulatory oversight. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2. The NCrF is based on a 6-level credit system.
3.  The NCrF includes experiential learning as a means of earning credits.
4. The NCrF aims to reduce flexibility and mobility in the education system.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, are correct. The NCrF does integrate credits from various educational pathways. Experiential learning is a recognized method for credit accumulation. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NCrF uses an 8-level system, not 6.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NCrF explicitly aims to *increase* flexibility and mobility. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**11. Consider the following statements related to the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.
2. The Index assesses only economic participation and opportunity.
3. India's ranking in 2023 was above 130.
4.  The Index considers political empowerment as a parameter.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The World Economic Forum does release the index annually, and political empowerment is a key parameter. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the index considers multiple parameters beyond economic participation. Statement 3 is also incorrect; India's ranking in 2023 was 127, not above 130. Therefore, only three statements are true.


**12. Consider the following about the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

1. The UNPFII was established in 2000.
2.  The UNPFII is a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3 are correct. The UNPFII was established in 2000 and does comprise 16 independent experts. However, statement 2 is incorrect; it's a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Statement 4 is also incorrect; economic and social development is a core part of its mandate. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**13. Consider the following organizations mentioned in the text:**

1.  International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)
2.  United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
3.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
4.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)

How many of the above are UN agencies?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** UNHCR, GANHRI, and UNFPA are UN agencies or closely related organizations.  IFPRI, while working with the UN, is a major research center of the CGIAR, not directly a UN agency.  Therefore, only three of the listed organizations are UN agencies.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1.  The NIF aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
2. The NIF includes only indicators tailored to India's specific needs.

4.  The IAEG-SDGs is responsible for developing the NIF.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NIF does align with the GIF, and the MoSPI developed it in 2018. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF includes both globally aligned indicators and those specific to India. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the IAEG-SDGs develops the GIF, not the NIF.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Caste Census:**

1.  The Census is a Union subject under Article 246 of the Constitution.
2. The caste-wise enumeration of the population was first introduced in India in 1941.
3.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, published caste data in 2016.
4. The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India is responsible for conducting the decadal census.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The Census is a Union subject, and the Registrar General is responsible for the decadal census.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; caste-wise enumeration began earlier than 1941, during the British era. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the caste data from the SECC, 2011, has not yet been fully published. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The first recognition of PVTGs was in 1973 under the name Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology levels and high literacy rates.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The government initially recognized these groups as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961).  They were later renamed as PVTGs in 2006.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While pre-agricultural technology levels and economic backwardness are criteria, low literacy rates are a key characteristic, not high literacy.

Statement 3 is correct. Odisha indeed houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the trans-state nature of some tribal groups and the complexities of their categorization.



**2. Consider the following regarding Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated there are nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While all DNTs are nomadic tribes, the reverse is not true; not all nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.  The categorization is specific and not all-encompassing.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which unjustly labeled certain groups as "criminal by birth," was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Renke Commission's report estimated the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes to be around 1,500, comprising a significant portion of the Indian population.

Statement 4 is correct.  August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities, signifying their ongoing struggle for recognition and rights.

2.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNT children.
3.  The SEED scheme provides health insurance to all DNT families.
4.  A Development and Welfare Board for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities was formed in 2019.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect government initiatives?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCDNT's mandate includes preparing state-wise lists of castes belonging to DNTs, not a single national list.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme specifically targets the construction of hostels for DNT boys and girls, aiding in their education and well-being.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the SEED scheme does offer various benefits, health insurance is not provided to *all* DNT families, but rather to a targeted number of families.

Statement 4 is correct. The Development and Welfare Board was indeed established in 2019 to focus on the comprehensive development of DNT communities.



**4. Consider the following concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3.  Free education is guaranteed for children with any disability between the ages of 6 and 18.
4.  The Act establishes a special court in every district for faster adjudication of cases.


Which of the statements correctly reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%, and this reservation does not apply to police forces.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act significantly expands the definition of disability to include 21 types, encompassing a wider range of impairments, including those caused by acid attacks.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Free education is guaranteed for children with *benchmark* disabilities (at least 40% disability), not for all children with disabilities.

Statement 4 is correct. The Act does stipulate the establishment of special courts in every district to expedite the resolution of cases related to disability rights violations.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning Manual Scavenging in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) allows for manual scavenging under specific conditions.
2.  The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3.  Safal karamcharis are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under PEMSR.
4.  The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

Which of the above statements are true regarding the PEMSR Act?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act strictly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers.  There are no exceptions that permit manual scavenging under any conditions.  The use of appropriate protective gear does not legitimize the practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their demolition within a fixed timeframe.  The process is gradual and involves conversion to sanitary latrines where feasible.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Safal karamcharis, who work in sanitation but may still be exposed to hazardous conditions, are considered manual scavengers under the Act unless adequate protective measures are in place.

Statement 4 is correct.  The PEMSR Act explicitly outlines provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including alternative employment opportunities, financial aid, and assistance in acquiring property.  This is a crucial aspect of the Act's focus on both prohibition and rehabilitation.

4.  GANHRI's objections to NHRC accreditation have included concerns about political interference in appointments.


Which of the statements accurately reflect information about the NHRC and GANHRI?

(a) 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI has been deferred on at least two occasions, highlighting concerns about the NHRC's functioning and compliance with international standards.

Statement 2 is correct.  Accreditation by GANHRI is crucial for the NHRC to effectively represent India at the UN Human Rights Council.  Without accreditation, its international standing is compromised.

Statement 3 is correct. The Paris Principles are internationally recognized standards that provide a framework for assessing the effectiveness and independence of NHRIs.  They are a key benchmark for GANHRI's evaluation process.

Statement 4 is correct.  GANHRI's concerns about the NHRC have consistently included issues such as political interference in appointments and a lack of sufficient independence in investigations.  These concerns are central to the principles of human rights monitoring.


**7. Consider the following about the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

How many of these statements correctly describe the UNPFII?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII was established in 2000, not 1982. The date mentioned refers to the first meeting of a different UN working group.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNPFII is indeed a high-level advisory body to the ECOSOC, reflecting its importance within the UN system.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UNPFII's membership is composed of both government-nominated experts and experts nominated directly by indigenous organizations, ensuring representation of indigenous perspectives.

Statement 4 is correct.  The UNPFII's mandate explicitly includes addressing a broad range of indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NIF aligns with the GIF, it also includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs, going beyond a direct replication of global indicators.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NIF was developed in 2018, not 2019.  The 2019 date may refer to subsequent updates or guidelines.

Statement 3 is correct. MoSPI is indeed the ministry responsible for developing, implementing, and monitoring the NIF.

Statement 4 is correct. India has served on the IAEG-SDGs for multiple terms, demonstrating its active participation in the global SDG agenda.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs receive both a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives, rewarding their effective service delivery.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative broadens its scope beyond nutrition to encompass early childhood care and education, and also targets adolescent girls in certain regions.

Statement 4 is correct. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for tracking nutrition-related data and service delivery at the grassroots level.  It is used by AWWs for reporting and monitoring.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels according to the GHI.
3.  India's GHI score has shown a consistent upward trend since 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the GHI?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank.

Statement 2 is correct.  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are consistently categorized as regions with the highest levels of hunger according to the GHI.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's GHI score has shown some improvement since 2015, but it hasn't shown a consistently upward trend.  There have been fluctuations.

Statement 4 is correct. The Indian government has voiced concerns about the GHI methodology, citing issues with data sources and sample sizes.  These concerns highlight the complexities and challenges involved in measuring hunger accurately on a global scale.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) can use donor sperm and their own eggs for surrogacy.
3.  The rules explicitly allow commercial surrogacy under specific medical conditions.
4. The rules maintain the 2022 prohibition on the use of donor gametes in surrogacy.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the 2024 amendments?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allow surrogacy with donor gametes only if at least one gamete originates from the intending couple. This addresses situations where one partner has fertility issues requiring gamete donation. Statement 2 is also accurate. The rules allow single women (widows or divorcees) to utilize their own eggs and donor sperm for surrogacy, providing an avenue for single parenthood through this method. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, and the 2024 amendments do not alter this stance.  Altruistic surrogacy remains the only legally permissible form. Statement 4 is false because the 2024 amendment changes Rule 7 of the 2022 Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, removing the previous ban on donor gametes under specific conditions. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following aspects of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  It defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse.
2.  It allows for the filing of complaints only by the aggrieved woman herself.
3.  It provides for civil remedies but not criminal prosecution for marital rape.
4. It exclusively covers women in legally recognized marital relationships.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PWDVA, 2005?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, has a broader definition of domestic violence, including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the aggrieved woman can file a complaint, the Act also allows for complaints to be filed by a Protection Officer or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved woman.  Statement 3 is correct. The PWDVA primarily provides civil remedies.  It does not directly address the criminal aspect of marital rape; that falls under other laws. Statement 4 is incorrect. The PWDVA extends its protection to women in various domestic relationships, including those who are cohabiting, regardless of the legal status of their relationship. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It aims to exclusively integrate credits earned through higher education.
2.  It is designed to be a rigid, inflexible framework, maintaining strict separation between different educational pathways.
3.  It encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) but excludes vocational and school education frameworks.
4. It seeks to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across school, higher, and vocational education.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF's primary goal is to integrate credits from various educational pathways, including school, higher, and vocational education.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The NCrF is designed to provide flexibility and mobility between different educational streams, allowing for seamless credit transfer. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate credits earned through all three mentioned frameworks (NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF).  Statement 4 accurately reflects the NCrF's objective – to establish a unified credit framework facilitating smooth transitions between different levels and types of education.  Therefore, only statement 4 is correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  It shows a significant improvement in India's hunger situation compared to 2015.
2.  It ranks India among the countries with the lowest levels of hunger globally.
3.  It utilizes data on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
4.  It is published by an intergovernmental organization of the United Nations.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings and context of the GHI 2023 report?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's GHI score showed a slight improvement from 2015, it did not represent a significant change and India still faces a serious hunger challenge.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 ranked India relatively low, indicating a serious hunger situation, not among the lowest globally. Statement 3 is correct. The GHI uses data on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to calculate its index. Statement 4 is incorrect. The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, which are Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), not a UN intergovernmental organization. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  The NRF is primarily focused on research in humanities and social sciences.
2.  The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3.  The Act repeals the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008.
4. The NRF is primarily funded through international collaborations and grants.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the NRF Act?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NRF encompasses interdisciplinary areas, its focus extends to natural sciences, engineering, technology, environmental sciences, health, agriculture,  and scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences. Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board. Statement 3 is correct. The Anusandhan NRF Act, 2023, repeals the SERB Act, 2008, and subsumes SERB into the NRF. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The NRF's funding primarily comes from the central government, donations, investment income, and existing funds. While international collaborations might play a role, they are not the primary source of funding. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  "Temple of Healing v. Union of India" judgment:**

1. It mandates the immediate removal of all children from Childcare Institutions (CCIs).
2. It focuses solely on children whose parents have a history of substance abuse.
3. It emphasizes collaborative efforts to increase the number of children available for adoption.
4. It directs states to register all Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered (OAS) children on the CARINGS portal.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the judgment?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment doesn't mandate the immediate removal of all children from CCIs, but rather focuses on identifying specific children who meet certain criteria for inclusion in the adoption pool. Statement 2 is incorrect. While substance abuse is one factor considered in determining "unfit" parents or guardians, the judgment encompasses a broader range of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and criminal records. Statement 3 is correct. The judgment strongly advocates for collaborative efforts to make more children available for adoption. Statement 4 is correct.  The judgment directs states to ensure registration of OAS children on the CARINGS portal.  Therefore, statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect the judgment's key aspects.

4. KIRAN scheme encourages women scientists in S&T.

How many of the above statements correctly describe initiatives supporting women in STEM?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. Vigyan Jyoti focuses on creating a level playing field for meritorious girls in high school to pursue STEM careers, not vocational training. Statement 2 is correct. I-STEM provides access to research infrastructure and labs for women and others in STEM. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Boeing Sukanya program aims to encourage girls to enter the aviation sector, focusing on STEM education and training from an early stage, not exclusively for women already working in the field. Statement 4 is correct. KIRAN specifically supports women scientists in S&T fields. Therefore, statements 2 and 4 accurately describe initiatives promoting women in STEM.


**8. Consider the following regarding the  "Laxman Naskar versus Union of India" judgment:**

1. It pertains to the right to education.
2. It deals with issues related to police reforms.
3. It centers on the right to privacy.
4. It concerns preventive detention.

Which of the above correctly identifies the subject matter of the judgment?

(a) 1 only (b) 2 only (c) 3 only (d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The "Laxman Naskar versus Union of India" judgment primarily deals with preventive detention.  It does not directly address the right to education (1), police reforms (2), or the right to privacy (3).  Therefore, only option (d) is correct.

1. It is awarded biennially.
2. Nominees are exclusively from India.
3. The Ministry of Culture awards the prize.
4. The prize is awarded annually.

How many of the statements above are incorrect regarding the Indira Gandhi Prize?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the prize is awarded annually, not biennially. Statement 2 is incorrect; the recipients are chosen from a pool of national and international nominees. Statement 3 is correct; the Ministry of Culture awards the prize. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, two statements (1 and 2) are incorrect.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Prakash Singh judgment of 2006:**

1. It relates to electoral reforms.
2. It addresses police reforms.
3. It focuses on judicial accountability.
4. It concerns environmental conservation.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the subject matter of the Prakash Singh judgment?


(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Prakash Singh judgment of 2006 primarily deals with police reforms (2). It does not directly address electoral reforms (1), judicial accountability (3), or environmental conservation (4).  Therefore, only one statement (2) is correct.


**11. Consider the following regarding the "Kasturirangan Committee":**

1. It is related to Army pay scales.
2. It is associated with reforms in the banking sector.
3. It is concerned with the conservation of the Western Ghats.
4. It pertains to centre-state fiscal relationships.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the focus of the Kasturirangan Committee?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Kasturirangan Committee is primarily known for its work on the conservation of the Western Ghats (3).  It is not directly related to Army pay scales (1), banking sector reforms (2), or centre-state fiscal relationships (4). Therefore, only one statement (3) is correct.

1. It is awarded to recognize contributions to urban development.
2. It is only conferred on individuals under 30.
3. It comes with a significant monetary award.
4. It recognizes exceptional contributions to rural development in India.

How many of the statements above are incorrect concerning the Rohini Nayyar Prize?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the prize recognizes contributions to rural development. Statement 2 is incorrect; while there might be an age limit, it is not specified as under 30. Statement 3 is possibly incorrect as it is not explicitly mentioned whether it comes with a monetary award. Statement 4 is correct. Therefore, at least two or three statements are incorrect.


**13. Consider the following regarding the Bibek Debroy Committee's recommendations on the Indian Railways' accounting system:**

1.  The primary objective was to privatize the financial operations of Indian Railways.
2.  The recommendation was to shift to a simplified cash-based accounting system.
3.  The aim was to improve financial transparency and accountability using accrual accounting.
4. The recommendation was to transition to an international currency-based system.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the committee's primary objective?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The Bibek Debroy Committee's primary recommendation for overhauling the Indian Railways' accounting system was to improve financial transparency and accountability through accrual accounting (3).  The other options (1, 2, and 4) misrepresent the committee's main goal. Therefore, only one statement (3) is correct.


**14. Consider the following statements concerning the country that recently announced a public ban on facial coverings:**

1. The ban is scheduled to take effect in 2026.
2. The country is Switzerland.
3. The ban applies to all types of facial coverings.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the SOWC-2024 report?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; UNICEF releases the SOWC report. Statement 2 is incorrect; the report examines multiple global forces, not just climate change. Statement 3 is correct. Statement 4 is incorrect. Therefore, two statements are correct.


**21. Consider the following groups primarily associated with Northern Europe:**

1.  Sami
2.  Kvens
3.  Forest Finns
4.  Inuit

How many of the above groups are primarily associated with Northern Europe?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

1. Consider the following statements regarding the Global Gender Gap Index:

1. It is released annually by the World Economic Forum.
2. It assesses gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
3.  India's ranking in 2023 was among the top 50 countries globally.
4. The index measures women's representation in local governance.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed published annually by the World Economic Forum and uses the four parameters listed. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's 2023 ranking was 127 out of 146, far from the top 50. While statement 4 is factually accurate regarding women's representation in local governance,  the index itself doesn't solely focus on this aspect; it incorporates a broader range of indicators for a comprehensive assessment of gender equality.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.  The inclusion of seemingly correct but ultimately inaccurate information (statement 3) and the broader scope of the index (in relation to statement 4) creates a challenging question for the examinee, requiring precise knowledge of the index's components and India's specific ranking.


2. Consider the following statements about the Gender Social Norms Index:

1. It's released by the World Health Organization.
2. It measures gender inequality across four dimensions: Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity.
3. It aims to understand systemic disadvantages faced by girls and women globally.
4.  The index uses a scale from 0 (best) to 100 (worst).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct; the index does aim to understand systemic disadvantages faced by women.  Statement 2 is also largely correct, listing the four dimensions accurately. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the WHO.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the scale is actually from 0 (worst) to 100 (best), reversing the presented order. Thus, only two statements are accurate, making this a difficult question requiring precise knowledge of the index's source and scoring system.  The inclusion of the reversed scale and the substitution of UNDP with WHO serve as effective distractors.


3. Consider the following concerning the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI):

1.  It is jointly released by the World Health Organization and UNICEF.
2. It tracks SDG 3.8.1, encompassing four indicator categories related to health outcomes and service access.
3. India's score improved between 2019 and 2021.
4.  The index is measured on a scale from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 4 are correct. The SCI does track SDG 3.8.1 and uses the 0-100 scale as described.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the SCI is a joint release by the World Health Organization and the World Bank, not UNICEF. Statement 3 is also incorrect. India's SCI score declined from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021, showing a worsening, not an improvement, in health coverage.  The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect details regarding the releasing organizations and the trend in India's score makes this question challenging, requiring precise recall of the index's details.


4. Consider the following regarding the "Path to Equal" Report and its indices:

1. It is solely prepared by the United Nations Development Programme.
2. The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) focuses exclusively on women's power and freedoms.
3. The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) evaluates women's status relative to men in core human development areas.
4. Both indices measure gender equality across the same dimensions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate descriptions of the WEI and GGPI, respectively.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while both indices address gender equality, they do so with different focuses and dimensions.  The WEI concentrates solely on women, while the GGPI compares women's status to men's.  The question's difficulty lies in the subtle inaccuracies regarding the report's authorship and the indices' comparative scopes, requiring careful attention to detail.


5. Consider these statements about the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT):

1. It operates under Article 344(3) of the Indian Constitution.
2. It aims to develop technical terminology in all Indian languages.
3. It was established in 1971.
4. Its work includes translating scientific terminology into ten underrepresented Indian languages.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the CSTT's objectives and work.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the CSTT was established in 1961, not 1971.  Statement 1 is also incorrect; it operates under Article 344(4), not 344(3).   The question's difficulty stems from the close proximity of the incorrect years and article numbers to the correct ones, demanding precise factual knowledge.


6. Consider the following statements about the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):

1. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
2. It is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
3. Its research focuses primarily on climate change mitigation.
4. It works in over 60 countries, including India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. IFPRI is indeed a CGIAR research center and operates in over 60 countries, including India. However, statement 1 is incorrect; its headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while IFPRI's research touches upon climate change's impact on food security, it's not the sole or primary focus.  The question challenges the examinee with a seemingly plausible but incorrect location and a misleading description of the research focus, requiring precise knowledge of the institute's headquarters and research priorities.


7. Consider the following regarding the UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report":

1. It reported a 21% decrease in forced migration due to social and climate crises compared to 2021.
2. The report was released by the World Food Programme.
3.  It stated that a significant percentage of forcibly displaced people are children.
4.  The report highlighted that low- and middle-income countries host the majority of the world's refugees.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect findings from the UNHCR report.  A significant proportion of displaced people are children, and low- and middle-income countries host most refugees. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report showed a 21% *increase*, not decrease, in forced migration due to social and climate crises.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the report was released by the UNHCR, not the World Food Programme.  The question's difficulty stems from the deliberate inversion of the percentage change in forced migration and the substitution of the releasing organization, demanding precise understanding of the report's key findings.


8. Consider the following statements about the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):

1. It is headquartered in New York City.
2. It accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles.
3. India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has consistently received full accreditation from GANHRI.
4. GANHRI's supreme deliberative body is its General Assembly.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. GANHRI uses the Paris Principles for accreditation and its General Assembly is its highest decision-making body.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; GANHRI is headquartered in Geneva, not New York City.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NHRC's accreditation has been deferred by GANHRI on multiple occasions due to concerns about political interference and other issues.  The question's complexity arises from the incorrect location and the misleading information regarding the NHRC's accreditation status, necessitating precise knowledge of GANHRI's operations and the NHRC's history with the organization.


9. Consider the following statements about the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):

1. It is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly.
2. Its membership includes experts nominated by indigenous organizations.
3. It's headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
4. It deals exclusively with indigenous peoples' cultural issues.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.  While the UNPFII does include experts nominated by indigenous organizations, it's also composed of government-nominated experts.  The UNPFII’s mandate is broader than solely cultural issues; it addresses economic, social development, environmental, education, health, and human rights concerns related to indigenous peoples.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Statement 3 is also incorrect; its headquarters are in New York, not Geneva.  The question's difficulty lies in the nuanced inaccuracies concerning the forum's composition, mandate, and location, demanding a comprehensive understanding of its functions.


10. Consider the following about the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:

1. It was developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).
2. It includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
3.  It currently has fewer than 200 indicators.
4. It aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The NIF does include India-specific indicators and aligns with the GIF. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while the GIF is relevant, the NIF was developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not the IAEG-SDGs. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NIF in 2023 had 284 indicators, exceeding 200. The question's difficulty arises from the incorrect attribution of the NIF's development and the underestimation of the number of indicators, requiring precise recall of the framework's origins and scope.


11. Consider the following regarding the Bihar Caste Survey:

1. It is a full-scale population census.
2.  It was conducted under the Census Act of 1948.
3. It focused solely on caste demographics.
4. The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India conducted it.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct; the Bihar Caste Survey did focus on caste demographics.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was not a full-scale population census but a social survey. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while the Census Act of 1948 provides a framework for population censuses, the Bihar survey wasn't conducted under its purview. Statement 4 is incorrect; it was conducted by the Bihar state government, not the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. The question's difficulty stems from the subtle distinctions between the Bihar survey and a national census, demanding precise knowledge of the survey's nature and the entities involved.


12. Consider the following statements about the UNFPA's India Ageing Report 2023:

1. It was released in collaboration with the World Bank.

However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report indicated *weak* progress on more than half of the SDG targets. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report was released by UNDESA, not the UNCRC. The question's difficulty stems from the contrast between the actual report's findings and the presented options, requiring careful interpretation of the report's key messages.



14. Consider the following about the UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD):

1. It was renamed in 1954.
2.  It advises the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
3. It is composed of 47 member states.
4. India was not a member in 2023.


How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The WFP's headquarters are in Rome.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was founded in 1961.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; it's a joint program of the UN and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the World Bank. Statement 4 is incorrect; it received only half of its required funding for 2023.  The question's difficulty arises from the incorrect founding year, the substitution of the FAO with the World Bank, and the misleading information about its 2023 funding, requiring precise knowledge of the organization's details.


16. Consider the following about the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:

1. It was released by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2. It prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations.
3.  It addresses menstruation as a natural bodily process.
4. It mandates paid menstrual leave for all workers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct; the policy prioritizes vulnerable groups and acknowledges menstruation as a natural process.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while Spain has introduced paid menstrual leave, the Indian policy doesn't mandate this. Statement 1 is also incorrect; it was released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. The question's difficulty arises from the incorrect ministry and the misleading information regarding paid leave, demanding specific knowledge of the policy's contents and authorship.


17. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi System:

1. It is primarily funded by state governments.
2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium.
3.  It is part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
4. It focuses solely on providing nutritional support to children.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. AWWs receive a fixed honorarium, and the Anganwadi system is part of ICDS.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; while states may provide additional funding, the scheme is centrally sponsored. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Anganwadi system provides early childhood care and education, in addition to nutritional support.  The question's difficulty lies in the nuanced inaccuracies concerning funding and the scope of services provided, demanding a comprehensive understanding of the Anganwadi system's functions and funding mechanisms.


18. Consider the following statements concerning the "Burden of disease attributable to unsafe drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH)" report:

2.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 regulates ART clinics and banks.
3.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 governs adoption among Hindus.
4.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 deals with adoption of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children.

How many of the above Acts or regulations directly relate to the legal framework surrounding reproductive rights and family formation in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the legal framework concerning reproductive rights and family formation in India.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, directly address the legal parameters of surrogacy, a practice fundamentally linked to reproductive rights.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, regulates the broader field of assisted reproduction, encompassing technologies crucial for family building. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, while not explicitly focusing on reproductive rights, governs the legal process of adoption, a significant pathway to family formation. Finally, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, addresses the adoption of children who are orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered, again relating to family formation.  Therefore, all four options are relevant to the legal aspects of reproductive rights and family structure in India.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund), UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs), and UNCRC (UN Committee on Rights of the Child) all focus on aspects of human well-being and development.  The UNFPA's report on ageing directly addresses population dynamics and well-being.  The UNDESA report on SDGs covers a broad range of development indicators affecting human lives. The UNCRC's guidance on children's environmental rights highlights a critical aspect of child welfare.  The WFP (World Food Programme), while crucial for human well-being through food security, focuses on the financial aspect of securing funding for its operations in this instance.  Therefore, only three of the listed organizations are primarily concerned with monitoring and reporting on human well-being and development issues, making (c) the correct answer.

How many of the above initiatives are directly involved in improving access to healthcare services and reducing health disparities in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Yojana, National Health Policy 2017, and Intensified Mission Indradhanush are directly concerned with improving healthcare access and reducing health disparities.  Ayushman Bharat aims to improve access across all levels of care. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly targets UHC. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush directly addresses vaccine coverage, a key aspect of healthcare. The Anganwadi system, while crucial for child development and indirectly influencing health, is not primarily a healthcare initiative. Therefore, three of the initiatives are directly involved in improving healthcare services and reducing disparities, making (c) the correct answer.

3.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, included caste data which was later published.
4.  The Caste Census conducted in Bihar was a full-scale population census.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the frameworks and processes related to data collection and reporting on social and economic development in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements are entirely accurate. The NIF does align with global SDG indicators, and the GIF is indeed framed by the IAEG-SDGs.  However, the SECC 2011 caste data was *not* published; only other data was released.  The Bihar caste survey was also *not* a full-scale population census. It was a state-level initiative focusing on caste demographics. Therefore, only two statements are correct, making (b) the correct option.

The Supreme Court judgment significantly impacted LGBTQIA+ rights, particularly for transgender individuals.  The historical labeling of DNTs is well-documented. The Idate Commission's recommendation highlights the need for targeted support for DNTs. The definition of PVTGs accurately reflects their status within the Scheduled Tribes.  All four elements are factually correct and relevant, resulting in (d) as the correct answer.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 and its amendments:**

1.  The Act permits commercial surrogacy, allowing monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses.
2.  The 2024 amendments allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.
3.  The Act establishes the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) for oversight.
4.  The Act explicitly permits abortion of the surrogate child without the consent of the surrogate mother.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy where no monetary compensation is provided beyond medical expenses. Statement 2 is correct. The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, modified the earlier prohibition on donor gametes, allowing their use under specific conditions where the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, but requiring at least one gamete from the couple. Statement 3 is correct. The Act established the NARTSB to oversee the implementation of the Act and regulate surrogacy practices in India. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act requires written consent from the surrogate mother for abortion, in accordance with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 and its amendments:**

3.  The Act criminalizes all abortions except those performed under its provisions.
4.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, completely replaces the MTP Act's provisions.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the MTP Act and its legal standing?

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 (d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act extended the gestational age limit for abortion to 24 weeks for specific categories of women, not 30 weeks for all women.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act permits abortion up to 20 weeks based on the advice of one registered medical practitioner.  Statement 3 is correct; the Act makes abortion illegal unless it's performed as prescribed by the Act. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, contains provisions related to causing miscarriage, but it doesn't entirely replace the MTP Act. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using a single meta-framework.
2.  It mandates a uniform notional learning hour system across all levels of education (school, higher, vocational).
3.  It utilizes the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) to store credits earned through various educational pathways.
4.  It strictly prohibits the transfer of credits earned through vocational training into higher education programs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF's key features?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCrF aims to integrate credits across various educational sectors. Statement 2 is correct; it establishes a standardized notional learning hour system.

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in all government jobs, including police forces.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  It ensures free education for children with benchmark disabilities only in special schools.
4.  It establishes special courts in every district for faster adjudication of cases under the Act.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, this reservation does not apply to police forces. Statement 2 is correct; the Act lists 21 types of disabilities. Statement 3 is incorrect;  it provides for free education in a neighborhood school or a special school of the child's choice. Statement 4 is correct; the Act outlines the establishment of special courts. Thus, only statements 2, and 4 are entirely accurate.



**5. Consider the following concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**

1.  It defines manual scavengers solely as individuals employed to clean human waste from insanitary latrines.
2.  It criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines.
3.  It mandates the rehabilitation of manual scavengers solely through financial assistance.
4.  It holds only local authorities responsible for identifying manual scavengers.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the Act?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, encompassing those handling human waste from various sources, not just insanitary latrines. Statement 2 is correct; the Act prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines. Statement 3 is incorrect; rehabilitation includes training for alternate employment and other support beyond just financial aid. Statement 4 is incorrect; the responsibility for identifying manual scavengers extends beyond local authorities to include other relevant entities.  Therefore, only statements 2 is entirely correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5):**

1.  It is conducted by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  It exclusively focuses on maternal and child health indicators.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NFHS is conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Statement 2 is incorrect. While maternal and child health are significant components, NFHS-5 covers a much broader range of health and demographic indicators. Statement 3 is correct; it provides comprehensive data across various domains. Statement 4 is incorrect; NFHS data is crucial for policymaking in the health sector. Therefore, only statements 3 is correct.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the specified government initiatives or legal frameworks?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NCLP involves rehabilitation, its focus extends beyond vocational training to include education and other support. Statement 2 is correct; PENCIL is a key tool in combating child labour. Statement 3 is incorrect. The JJ Act defines a child as someone below 18 years of age. Statement 4 is incorrect; Bachpan Bachao Andolan is a non-governmental organization. Therefore, only statements 2 is entirely accurate.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(b) Only two

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.

The crucial condition is that at least one gamete must originate from the intending couple.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The rules stipulate that single women using surrogacy must use their own eggs and donor sperm. This reflects a specific regulatory approach to this category of surrogacy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent rules, explicitly prohibit commercial surrogacy.  The focus remains on altruistic surrogacy.

Statement 4 is incorrect because the 2024 rules amend the 2022 rules, specifically lifting the ban on donor gametes under defined conditions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the aggrieved woman is the primary complainant, the Act also allows Protection Officers or other individuals to file complaints on her behalf, particularly if she is incapacitated.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act explicitly provides for shelter homes and medical aid as forms of relief for victims of domestic violence.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The PWDVA explicitly states that its provisions are in addition to existing laws.  Reliefs under the PWDVA can be sought concurrently with other legal proceedings like divorce or maintenance cases.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2015 Act defined a "child" as a person below 18 years of age.  The provision allowing for the trial of 16-18-year-olds as adults in heinous offences was a key aspect of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2021 amendment introduced a mechanism for appealing adoption orders issued by District Magistrates, a change from the 2015 Act.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2021 amendment did indeed redefine "serious offences," aligning with Supreme Court recommendations from the *Shilpa Mittal* case.

Statement 4 is partially correct in that the categorization was based on potential imprisonment, but it wasn't *solely* based on length.  Other factors were also considered.  This makes the statement inaccurate enough to be considered incorrect.

The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides financial assistance to promote entrepreneurship in the sanitation sector, thereby indirectly reducing reliance on manual scavenging. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem focuses on a systemic shift towards mechanized cleaning methods, making manual scavenging obsolete. Finally, the SRMS scheme directly aids individuals previously involved in manual scavenging by providing them with resources and training to pursue alternative livelihoods.  These initiatives represent a multi-pronged approach, combining legislative action, financial support, technological advancement, and vocational rehabilitation to effectively address this critical social issue.


2. Consider the following features of the Anganwadi system in India:

1.  Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) are primarily managed by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs).
2. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate representations of the Anganwadi system. AWWs and AWHs are the frontline workers responsible for the day-to-day functioning of AWCs.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme explicitly aims to improve the nutritional and health status of the target population groups.  The compensation structure for AWWs and AWHs involves a combination of central and state-level funding.  The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for monitoring and data collection within the system.  However, statement 5 is incorrect. While the Anganwadi system plays a vital role in addressing child malnutrition, it is not solely responsible.  Other government programs and initiatives also contribute to efforts to combat malnutrition in India.  Therefore, four out of the five statements are correct.


3. Consider the following regarding the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report:

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly reflect aspects of the NFHS-5 report.  The survey indeed identified variations in the prevalence of spousal abuse across different Indian states, with some showing higher rates than others (statement 1 and 2).  The report also provided data on the prevalence of spousal violence among the specified age group of ever-married women (statement 4).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; NFHS-5 covers both rural and urban populations. Statement 5 is also incorrect; NFHS-5 was conducted between 2019 and 2021. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately represent the NFHS-5 report's findings.


4. Consider the following regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:

(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021. The Act explicitly legalizes only altruistic surrogacy, banning commercial practices.  It establishes the NARTSB to oversee and regulate the surrogacy process.  The Act also requires the surrogate mother's consent for any abortion during the surrogacy. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Act prohibits surrogacy for foreign nationals. Therefore, three out of the four statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.

(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect provisions of the PWDVA, 2005. The Act provides a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing various forms of abuse.  It extends protection to women in diverse familial relationships.  The Act also stipulates provisions for providing shelter and medical assistance to victims.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Act allows for complaints against a broader range of individuals involved in a domestic relationship with the aggrieved woman, including relatives of the husband or male partner.

(b) Two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe key aspects of the POSH Act. The Act provides a comprehensive definition of sexual harassment, including various forms of unwelcome behavior.  It mandates the formation of ICCs in workplaces exceeding a certain employee threshold.  The Act's foundation lies in the Vishaka Guidelines, which provided the initial framework for addressing sexual harassment at the workplace. Statement 3 is incorrect; the POSH Act's protection extends to women in both organized and unorganized sectors. Therefore, three out of the four statements accurately represent the POSH Act's provisions.

**1. Consider the following statements related to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a certified medical condition and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) can utilize surrogacy, but only with their own eggs and donor sperm.
3.  The rules explicitly allow commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances.
4.  The 2023 Supreme Court ruling in *Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India* influenced the amendment, allowing surrogacy for women with MRKH syndrome using donor eggs.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 and related legal context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the amendment's allowance of donor gametes in specific medical circumstances, ensuring at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.  Statement 2 correctly describes the limitations placed on single women seeking surrogacy. Statement 4 is accurate in that the *Arun Muthuvel* case highlighted the need for flexibility in surrogacy rules regarding conditions like MRKH syndrome, influencing the subsequent amendment.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments explicitly prohibit commercial surrogacy, focusing solely on altruistic surrogacy. The rules aim to prevent exploitation and ensure ethical practices within surrogacy.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**2. Consider the following regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, and its amendments:**

1.  The Act, as amended, allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women based on the advice of two doctors.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amended MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one doctor, not two, and up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances (as defined in the act)  requiring the advice of two doctors.  Statement 2 is correct; the 2021 amendment broadened access to MTP for various reasons, including rape and other specified grounds. Statement 3 is also correct; the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, incorporates provisions concerning causing miscarriage. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Act allows termination for foetal abnormalities, it's not irrespective of gestational age.  There are gestational limits within which such terminations are permitted. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act aims to eradicate manual scavenging but hasn't achieved complete elimination. Statement 2 is correct; the Act's definition includes handling un-decomposed waste without proper protection. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act mandates conversion of insanitary latrines, not necessarily immediate demolition. Statement 4 is correct; SRMS helps in rehabilitation and alternative employment. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately represent the Act and its associated schemes.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: NEP 2020 sets an ambitious target for GER in higher education.  Statement 2 is incorrect: NEP 2020 emphasizes flexibility and multiple exit/entry options,  not rigidity. Statement 3 is correct:  The policy promotes the establishment of MERUs to foster multidisciplinary learning.

4. The index exclusively focuses on the representation of women in local governance.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of the Global Gender Gap Index.  The index is indeed published annually by the World Economic Forum and evaluates gender parity across the four specified dimensions. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India's 2023 ranking of 127 out of 146 countries indicates a below-average performance in gender equality. Statement 4 is also false; while the index considers women's political empowerment, it doesn't solely focus on their representation in local governance.  The index offers a broader assessment of gender equality across various societal spheres.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 correctly identifies the dimensions assessed by the Gender Social Norms Index.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the index's objective of understanding systemic disadvantages faced by women.  The index does indeed aim to provide insights into the various forms of discrimination and inequality that women experience globally. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the UNDP, not the World Bank, publishes the Gender Social Norms Index.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. While many indices use a numerical scale, the Gender Social Norms Index doesn't specifically use a 0-100 scale.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

**Explanation:** The UHC SCI accurately tracks SDG target 3.8.1, focusing on universal health coverage.  It also correctly incorporates indicator categories for reproductive health, infectious diseases, and non-communicable diseases, providing a comprehensive view of health service coverage. However, statement 2 is false; the index is a joint product of WHO and the World Bank, not UNICEF.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; India's 2021 score declined to 63 from 64 in 2019, indicating a worsening, not an improvement, in UHC service coverage. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are true.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 correctly describes the WEI's focus on women's empowerment and capabilities, while statement 3 accurately describes the GGPI's comparative approach to assessing women's status relative to men's. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report is a joint effort of UN Women and UNDP, not the World Bank.  Statement 4 is also false; while economic empowerment is a component of both indices, they encompass broader aspects of human development, including political, educational, and social dimensions.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

1. Established in 1990 by the UN General Assembly.
2. It's a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 correctly identifies UNPFII as a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC. Statement 3 is also correct; its membership comprises experts nominated by both governments and indigenous organizations. However, statement 1 is incorrect; UNPFII was established in 2000, not 1990, by a resolution of ECOSOC, not the General Assembly.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while environmental issues are a part of its mandate, UNPFII addresses a broader range of indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, education, health, and human rights.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 is correct, NFHS-5 collects data on maternal and child health indicators, and statement 4 is also correct, as it provides data on malnutrition prevalence.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; NFHS surveys are not conducted every five years—their frequency varies. Statement 3 is also incorrect; NFHS is conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the WHO. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

1. It includes indicators aligned with global SDG indicators.
2. It was developed by the World Bank.
3. It includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
4. It contains fewer indicators than the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).

How many statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 correctly describe the NIF's features: alignment with global SDG indicators and inclusion of India-specific indicators.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF was developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not the World Bank.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NIF, in its 2023 version, contains more indicators (284) than the GIF (248).  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


12. Consider the following about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:

1. It assesses performance at the state and district levels.
2. It uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
3. It classifies states/UTs into ten grades.
4. No state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the PGI.  The PGI does assess performance at both state and district levels, utilizes a ten-grade classification system, and in PGI 2.0, no state/UT attained the highest grade.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the PGI utilizes data from both UDISE+ and NAS, not solely from NAS.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


13. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's impact on higher education:

1. Aims for a 50% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2035.
2. Introduces multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees.
3.  Mandates the establishment of only single-disciplinary universities.
4.  Focuses on de-emphasizing research and innovation.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe NEP 2020's goals for higher education: a 50% GER by 2035 and the introduction of multiple exit options for undergraduate programs.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; NEP 2020 promotes multidisciplinary education and research. Statement 4 is also incorrect; NEP 2020 emphasizes research and innovation through initiatives like the National Research Foundation (NRF).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


14. Consider the following about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs):

1. Institutions less than 20 years old are eligible to apply for DtBU status.
2.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, superseded the 2019 regulations.
3.  DtBUs are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
4.  The NCERT has not been granted DtBU status.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of DtBUs and the 2023 regulations. Institutions less than 20 years old can now apply, the 2023 regulations replaced the 2019 ones, and DtBUs are required to utilize the ABC system. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NCERT has indeed been granted DtBU status.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims for "difficult," leveraging plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

1. It is released biennially by the World Economic Forum.
2. It includes parameters related to Health and Survival, Educational Attainment, and Political Empowerment.
3. India's ranking in 2023 was below the median position among the assessed countries.
4.  The index measures women's representation in national governance exclusively.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  
(b) Only two  
(c) Only three  
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed released annually by the World Economic Forum, making statement 1 incorrect. Statements 2 and 3 are correct; the index covers those parameters, and India's 127th rank out of 146 in 2023 places it below the median. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the index considers various aspects beyond national governance, including local governance as evidenced by India's 44.4% female representation at the local level.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Gender Social Norms Index:**

1. It's published by the World Bank.
2. It assesses discrimination faced by women across dimensions like political participation and economic opportunity.
3. It employs a numerical scoring system, ranging from 0 to 100.
4. It primarily focuses on the legal frameworks governing gender equality.

Which of the above are features of the Gender Social Norms Index?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Gender Social Norms Index is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank, making statement 1 incorrect.  While the index does assess discrimination against women and girls (statement 2 is correct), it doesn't use a 0-100 numerical scoring system like the UHC Service Coverage Index; hence, statement 3 is false.  Finally, statement 4 is incorrect; the index focuses on social norms and societal attitudes, not just legal frameworks.  Only statement 2 accurately describes a key feature of the index.


**3. Consider the following about the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI):**

1. It's a joint initiative of the WHO and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the UHC SCI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the UHC SCI is a collaboration between the WHO and the World Bank, not the IMF. Statement 2 is correct; the index monitors progress on SDG 3.8.1 and includes the specified disease categories. Statement 3 is false; India's score declined from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021.

4. The report primarily examines the legal frameworks for gender equality.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the "Path to Equal" report?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The "Path to Equal" report is a joint initiative of UN Women and UNDP, not the World Economic Forum, making statement 1 incorrect.  Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the report's core components: the WEI focuses on women's empowerment, while the GGPI compares women's and men's status. Statement 4 is incorrect; the report examines broader aspects of gender equality beyond just legal frameworks.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.



**5. Consider the following features of the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT):**

1. It operates under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. Its mandate includes developing technical terminology in all Indian languages, including those in the Eighth Schedule.
3. It was established in 1971.
4. It focuses exclusively on scientific terminology, excluding technical terms.


Which of the above are accurate descriptions of the CSTT?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

1. It's developed and released by the NITI Aayog.
2. It aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) but also incorporates India-specific indicators.
3. It currently comprises over 250 indicators.
4.  It was initially developed in 2015.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the NIF?


(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NIF is developed and released by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not NITI Aayog, making statement 1 false. Statement 2 is correct; the NIF aligns with the GIF while including India-specific indicators. Statement 3 is correct; the 2023 NIF includes 284 indicators. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NIF was developed in 2018.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**7. Consider the following in relation to the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. It's jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Oxfam International.
2.  India's ranking improved significantly compared to the 2015 GHI.
3. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa show the highest hunger levels.
4. The Indian government fully endorsed the methodology and data used in the 2023 GHI.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the 2023 GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The 2023 GHI was released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not Oxfam International, making statement 1 incorrect. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while India's score slightly improved from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023, this is not a significant improvement. Statement 3 is correct; South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa recorded the highest hunger levels. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Indian government raised objections to the GHI's methodology and data.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status:**

1.  It requires the complete absence of visible faeces in the environment.
2.  It mandates arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
3.  It's solely focused on sanitation, excluding aspects of visual cleanliness.
4.  Achievement of ODF Plus automatically implies ODF status.

How many of the statements above correctly describe the ODF Plus status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  ODF Plus requires the absence of visible faeces and builds upon the achievement of ODF status.  However, statement 2 is partially correct; while ODF Plus does involve waste management, it doesn't *necessarily* require *both* solid and liquid waste management systems simultaneously; either one suffices.  Statement 3 is incorrect; ODF Plus includes visual cleanliness criteria. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) provide a completely accurate description.


**9. Consider the following about the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):**

1. It is a constitutional body.
2.  It issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences under the JJ Act, 2015.
3. It functions under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
4. Its primary focus is on the enforcement of labor laws related to children.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the NCPCR?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The NCPCR is a statutory body, not a constitutional body, making statement 1 incorrect. Statement 2 is correct; the NCPCR issued guidelines for assessing child suspects as mentioned. Statement 3 is also correct; it operates under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCPCR's mandate is broader than just labor laws; it encompasses the overall protection of children's rights.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are correct.


**10. Consider the following about the Anganwadi system:**

1. It's primarily focused on the education of children aged 6-14 years.

How many of the above statements correctly characterize the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system focuses on children aged 0-6 years, along with pregnant women and lactating mothers. Statement 2 is false; AWWs receive both a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives. Statement 3 is correct; Saksham Anganwadis aims to improve AWCs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Only statement 3 is entirely accurate.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971, making statement 1 incorrect.  The other statements accurately reflect IFPRI's founding year, location, operational scope, and research focus. The institute's work directly addresses critical issues of food security, poverty alleviation, and malnutrition, aligning with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and global efforts to combat hunger. Its presence in numerous countries, including India, highlights its commitment to tackling these challenges on a global scale.  The detailed research and policy recommendations produced by IFPRI are highly valued by governments and international organizations involved in food security and development initiatives.

**2. Consider the following regarding the UNHCR's 2022 report on forced displacement:**

1.  The report indicated that forced displacement was 10% higher in 2022 compared to 2021.
2.  Over 75% of the world's refugees were hosted by high-income countries.
3. The report highlighted that children constituted less than 25% of the forcibly displaced population.
4.  The report documented approximately 4.4 million stateless people globally.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNHCR's report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The UNHCR report showed a 21% increase in forced displacement in 2022 compared to 2021, not 10%.  Statement 2 is incorrect; 76% of refugees were hosted by low- and middle-income countries. Statement 3 is also incorrect; children constituted 30% of the forcibly displaced population. The accurate reporting of stateless individuals demonstrates the UNHCR's commitment to addressing the complex issue of statelessness and its impact on vulnerable populations.  The report's findings underscore the urgent need for international cooperation and comprehensive strategies to address the root causes of forced displacement and protect the rights and well-being of those affected.

**3. Consider the following statements about the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):**

1. GANHRI was established in 1995.
2.  Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.
3.  It accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Cairo Principles.
4.  India's NHRC has consistently received full accreditation from GANHRI.

How many of these statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are partially correct. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1995, making statement 1 incorrect.  While its headquarters are indeed in Geneva, Switzerland, statement 3 is inaccurate because GANHRI uses the Paris Principles, not the Cairo Principles, as the basis for accrediting NHRIs.  Statement 4 is false; the NHRC's accreditation has been deferred multiple times due to concerns regarding political interference and cooperation with civil society. The Paris Principles serve as a crucial benchmark for evaluating the independence, effectiveness, and compliance of NHRIs worldwide, contributing to the global promotion and protection of human rights. The deferral of the NHRC's accreditation highlights the importance of upholding these principles for maintaining the integrity and credibility of national human rights mechanisms.


**4. Consider the following about the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

1. It was established in 2001 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly.
2. It is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
3.  Its membership comprises 16 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations.
4. The UNPFII's mandate excludes environmental issues.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNPFII?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The UNPFII was established in July 2000, not 2001, by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN General Assembly.  While it is indeed a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC,  the statement about membership is partially incorrect;  8 experts are nominated by governments and 8 by indigenous organizations.  Finally, environmental issues are explicitly included in its mandate. The UNPFII plays a crucial role in advocating for the rights and well-being of indigenous peoples globally, promoting their participation in decision-making processes, and addressing the unique challenges they face. The forum's focus on economic and social development, culture, education, health, and human rights, in addition to environmental concerns, reflects the holistic approach needed to address the complex issues faced by indigenous communities worldwide.


**5. Consider the following about the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1. The NIF includes only global indicators for SDGs.
2.  The NIF, as of 2023, contains over 300 indicators.
3. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) developed the NIF.
4. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is static and unchanging.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the NIF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The NIF includes both global and India-specific indicators for SDGs, making statement 1 incorrect.  As of 2023, the NIF contained 284 indicators, not over 300, making statement 2 incorrect.  MoSPI did indeed develop the NIF, and the GIF is dynamic and evolving, not static. The NIF's creation demonstrates India's commitment to achieving the SDGs. The inclusion of both global and national indicators reflects the need to tailor the monitoring and evaluation of progress to the specific context and priorities of the country.  The ongoing evolution of the GIF and the NIF highlights the importance of regularly updating indicators to better reflect emerging trends and challenges.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1. It is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme.
2.  It assesses gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
3. India's ranking in 2023 was below 130.
4. The index includes a measure of women's representation in local governance.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Global Gender Gap Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP, making statement 1 incorrect.  The other statements accurately reflect the index's parameters, India's 2023 ranking (127 out of 146), and its inclusion of a measure of women's representation in local governance. The index provides a valuable tool for tracking progress towards gender equality globally and identifying areas where further action is needed.  The inclusion of various dimensions—economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment—reflects the multi-faceted nature of gender inequality and the need for comprehensive strategies to address it.  India's ranking highlights the ongoing challenges and the need for sustained efforts to improve gender equality.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  The primary objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-5 years.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium but no performance-linked incentives.
4.  The system aims to reach zero-dose children and pregnant women who missed vaccination doses.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anganwadi system?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, making statement 1 incorrect.  The primary objective covers children aged 0-6 years, not just 0-5, making statement 2 incorrect. AWWs do receive performance-linked incentives, making statement 3 incorrect.  The focus on reaching zero-dose children and pregnant women who missed vaccination doses is a key aspect of the system's efforts to improve immunization coverage and reduce preventable childhood mortality and morbidity.  The Anganwadi system serves as a crucial component of India's public health infrastructure, providing essential services to vulnerable populations and contributing to improvements in child health and nutrition.

**8. Consider the following regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) and ODF status:**

1.  ODF status signifies that every household uses safe sanitation technology, but open defecation might still occur in public places.
2.  ODF Plus status implies the sustained ODF status along with either solid or liquid waste management.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village necessarily demonstrates minimal litter and absence of plastic waste dumps in public areas.
4.  By September 2023, over 80% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Swachh Bharat Mission's objectives and achievements?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; ODF status explicitly requires the absence of visible feces in the environment, including public places.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; by September 2023, 75% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status, not over 80%. The ODF Plus Model village criteria highlight the comprehensive approach required to achieve sustainable sanitation and environmental cleanliness.  The progress made under the Swachh Bharat Mission demonstrates the significant strides taken in improving sanitation infrastructure and hygiene practices in rural India.  However, maintaining ODF status and achieving ODF Plus requires continued effort and investment in waste management systems.


**9. Consider the following about the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report:**

1. The survey revealed that spousal abuse was most prevalent in Bihar.
2.  It reported that less than 25% of ever-married women aged 18-49 had experienced spousal violence.
3.  The NFHS-5 data was collected in 2020-2021.
4. The survey covered both rural and urban areas.


How many of the above statements correctly represent the NFHS-5 findings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. While the NFHS-5 did show high rates of spousal abuse in Bihar, Karnataka had a higher percentage, making statement 1 partially incorrect.  The survey reported that 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 had experienced spousal violence, making statement 2 incorrect.  The data collection period was indeed 2019-2021, and the survey did cover both rural and urban areas.  The NFHS-5 provides valuable insights into the health and well-being of women in India and highlights the prevalence of gender-based violence. The data collected is crucial for informing policy interventions and programs aimed at addressing these important issues and promoting women's health and empowerment.

**10. Consider the following regarding the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1.  The Act defines a child as someone below the age of 16.
2.  The Act allows for the trial of children aged 16-18 as adults in cases of heinous offences.
3.  The 2021 amendment to the Act removed the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults.
4.  The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to assess child suspects.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct.  The Act defines a child as someone below 18, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Act does indeed allow for the trial of 16-18 year olds as adults in heinous offences, and the 2021 amendment did *not* remove this provision; it refined the definition of "heinous offences," making statement 3 incorrect.  Juvenile Justice Boards are established under the Act to assess child suspects. The Act's provisions reflect a complex balancing act between protecting children's rights and addressing serious crimes committed by older adolescents. The assessment process carried out by the Juvenile Justice Boards aims to ensure that the best interests of the child are considered while upholding the principles of justice.  The ongoing debate surrounding the age of criminal responsibility highlights the need for careful consideration of the developmental needs of adolescents and the implications of treating them as adults within the criminal justice system.


**1. Consider the following statements about Universal Health Coverage (UHC):**

1. UHC ensures all individuals have access to a comprehensive range of high-quality health services without facing financial hardship.
2. UHC encompasses the entire spectrum of essential health services, from health promotion and prevention to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.
3.  The key dimensions of UHC are accessibility, affordability, and equity.
4. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a significant initiative aimed at achieving UHC in India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the core principles and components of Universal Health Coverage?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly define the core principle of UHC: ensuring equitable access to a full range of quality health services without financial burden, encompassing the entire continuum of care.  Statement 4 is also correct; Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a major Indian government initiative designed to improve access to healthcare and reduce financial barriers. However, statement 3 is slightly inaccurate. While accessibility and affordability are key dimensions, the term "equity" is more appropriately considered a goal or outcome of achieving UHC, rather than a core dimension itself.  Equity implies fair distribution of healthcare resources and access, which is a desired result of a well-functioning UHC system, not a defining dimension.  Therefore, three statements accurately reflect the core principles and components of UHC.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to healthcare access in India:**

1. Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
2. Intensified Mission Indradhanush
3. National Health Policy 2017
4. Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY)

How many of these initiatives directly contribute to improving access to quality healthcare services for the Indian population?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to improve access to quality healthcare through technology and national portability of health services.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on increasing vaccination coverage, a crucial aspect of preventive healthcare and improved health outcomes. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims at achieving UHC.  However, PMJJBY is a life insurance scheme, not directly related to healthcare access. It provides financial security in case of death, indirectly impacting the financial burden on families, but it doesn't directly improve access to healthcare services. Therefore, three of the listed initiatives directly contribute to enhancing access to quality healthcare.


**3. Consider the following features of the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Operates under the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme.
2.  Provides nutritional and healthcare services to children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  Employs Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) who receive a fixed monthly honorarium.
4.  Exclusively focuses on children aged 0-6 years, neglecting the needs of older children and adolescents.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the Anganwadi system. The system operates under the renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, focusing on improving the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  AWWs and AWHs are integral to the system and receive a fixed monthly honorarium.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Anganwadi system's primary focus is on young children, initiatives like Saksham Anganwadis are expanding to encompass older children and adolescents, particularly in Aspirational Districts and the North Eastern Region (NER), offering early childhood care and education, and early stimulation for children aged 0-3 years.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following roles performed by community health workers in India:**

1. Providing early childhood care and development services.
2.  Administering curative care and supplying medicines.
3.  Conducting research on emerging infectious diseases.
4.  Creating awareness about factors influencing health status and providing counseling.

How many of the above roles are commonly undertaken by at least one category of community health workers (AWWs, ANMs, ASHAs) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) play a significant role in providing early childhood care and development services. Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) focus on maternal and child health and often administer curative care and supply medicines. Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) play a crucial role in creating awareness about health issues, conducting counseling, and promoting health-seeking behaviors. However, conducting research on emerging infectious diseases is not a primary role for these community health workers; this is typically undertaken by trained researchers and epidemiologists. Therefore, three of the given roles are commonly undertaken by at least one category of community health workers.


**5. Consider the following aspects related to the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. The GHI is published annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently exhibit the highest hunger levels.
4. The Indian government has consistently endorsed the GHI methodology and findings.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Global Hunger Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The GHI does indeed use undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality as key indicators, and South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa generally have the highest hunger levels.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Indian government has frequently raised objections to the GHI methodology and data sources.  Therefore, only two of the statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in India:**

1.  ODF Plus status requires the sustained elimination of open defecation and the implementation of solid waste management systems.
2.  ODF Plus Model villages additionally implement liquid waste management systems and maintain visual cleanliness.
3.  Achieving ODF Plus status is mandatory for all villages in India by a specified deadline.
4. ODF Plus certification is solely dependent upon self-reporting by local authorities.

How many of the above statements correctly characterize the ODF Plus initiative in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the ODF Plus initiative.  Sustained ODF status coupled with solid waste management is a requirement for ODF Plus. ODF Plus Model villages go further by including liquid waste management and visual cleanliness standards. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the government actively promotes ODF Plus, it's not a mandatory requirement with a fixed deadline for all villages. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while self-reporting plays a role, verification and monitoring mechanisms are in place to assess the claims made by local authorities.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the ODF Plus initiative.


**7. Consider the following regarding the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan:**

1. Launched in 2017, it aims to reduce stunting in India's most malnourished districts.
2.  It focuses solely on improving nutritional outcomes for children, neglecting pregnant women and mothers.
3.  It leverages the Anganwadi system as a key delivery mechanism for its interventions.
4.  It is entirely funded by international organizations and does not receive any domestic funding.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the POSHAN Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting, primarily in high-burden districts. Statement 3 is also correct; the Anganwadi system is a crucial component of POSHAN Abhiyan's implementation strategy. However, statement 2 is incorrect; POSHAN Abhiyan aims to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; POSHAN Abhiyan receives funding from the Indian government and may also receive supplementary funding from international organizations, but it is not solely reliant on international funding. Therefore, only two of the four statements accurately describe the POSHAN Abhiyan.


**8. Consider the following about the roles of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs), Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs), and Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs):**

1. AWWs primarily focus on early childhood care and development.
2. ANMs provide comprehensive maternal and child health services, including immunizations.
3. ASHAs primarily focus on disease surveillance and epidemiological research.
4. All three categories receive comparable levels of compensation and benefits.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the roles and compensation of these community health workers?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the primary roles of AWWs and ANMs.  AWWs focus on early childhood care and nutrition, while ANMs provide broader maternal and child health services. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while ASHAs do contribute to disease surveillance, their primary role is community health promotion, not epidemiological research.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the compensation and benefits packages for AWWs, ANMs, and ASHAs vary depending on state-level policies and may not be entirely comparable. Therefore, only two of the statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1.  The NIF aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) but also includes India-specific indicators.
2.  The NIF is static and does not undergo any revisions or updates.
3.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and maintaining the NIF.
4.  State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) are developed independently of the NIF and do not need to align with it.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NIF for SDGs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NIF aligns with the GIF but also incorporates indicators relevant to India's context, and MoSPI is responsible for its development and maintenance. The NIF is also dynamic and regularly updated to incorporate new data and methodologies. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF is an evolving framework. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while states develop their SIFs, these are intended to complement and align with the national NIF to ensure a cohesive approach to SDG monitoring across the country.  Therefore, three statements accurately reflect the characteristics of the NIF.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Saksham Anganwadis initiative:**

1. It aims to strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across India.
2. It incorporates the use of smartphones and digital tracking systems for efficient service delivery.
3. It exclusively focuses on improving services for children aged 0-6 years, excluding adolescents.
4.  It is solely funded by international development agencies and does not receive any domestic funding.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Saksham Anganwadis initiative?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe Saksham Anganwadis.  The initiative aims to strengthen AWCs and employs digital technologies for improved service delivery and monitoring. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Saksham Anganwadis also expand services to include adolescents in certain regions. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Saksham Anganwadis receive funding from the Indian government, not solely from international agencies.  Therefore, only two of the statements are accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements related to the legal framework for child offences in India:**

1.  Offences punishable with imprisonment of more than seven years are cognizable, non-bailable, and triable in a Children's Court.
2.  Petty offences have a maximum punishment of imprisonment up to three years.
3.  The designated court for offences punishable with imprisonment exceeding seven years is a Magistrate's Court of First Class.
4.  Serious offences, with punishments ranging from three to seven years, mandate minimum imprisonment.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the legal provisions concerning child offences?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provision for offences punishable by more than seven years' imprisonment being cognizable, non-bailable, and tried in Children's Courts is a key feature of the juvenile justice system, designed to ensure specialized handling of such serious cases involving minors.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The provision for a maximum punishment of up to three years for petty offences reflects a tiered system of justice that differentiates between the severity of crimes committed by children.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Offences punishable by imprisonment exceeding seven years are specifically designated for trial in Children's Courts, not Magistrate's Courts of First Class, to ensure specialized handling and consideration of the child's age and circumstances.  Magistrate's Courts of First Class typically handle less serious offences.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While serious offences (three to seven years) might carry a minimum sentence in certain cases, it's not universally mandated across all such offences.  The specific minimum sentence would depend on the nature of the crime and the judge's discretion.

Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) accurately reflect the legal framework.


**2. Consider the following Acts related to anti-trafficking crimes in India:**

1.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily addresses the issue of bonded labour.
2.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, aims to prevent economic and physical exploitation, but not necessarily sexual exploitation.
3.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, criminalizes commercial dealing in human organs, a form of trafficking.
4.  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, exclusively focuses on sexual offences against adults.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the scope and purpose of these anti-trafficking laws?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily targets immoral trafficking and sex work, not bonded labour.  Bonded labour is addressed by a separate Act.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, focuses on preventing economic and physical exploitation, and while it doesn't explicitly mention sexual exploitation, it indirectly addresses a form of exploitation that can overlap with trafficking.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, directly addresses organ trafficking, a serious form of human trafficking.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The POCSO Act, 2012, explicitly protects children from various forms of sexual abuse, including sexual assault, harassment, and pornography.  It does not exclusively focus on adults.

Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and partially 4) offer a correct, albeit nuanced, understanding of the scope of these laws.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Age of Consent in India:**

1.  The age of consent is consistently defined as 18 years across all relevant legislation.
2.  The POCSO Act, 2012, sets the age of consent at 18 years, aligning with the definition of a child.
3.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, eliminates the marital rape exception for women under 18.
4.  Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, as amended by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 2013, raised the age of consent to 18, with no exceptions.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the legal position on the age of consent?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the age of consent is predominantly 18, there have been historical exceptions and nuances in different legal provisions. The BNS, 2023, for instance, has implications for the definition of consent within marriage.

Statement 2 is correct. The POCSO Act, 2012, clearly defines a child as someone below 18, thus establishing a de facto age of consent for sexual activity.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The BNS, 2023, while raising the age of consent within the definition of rape to 18, still retains the marital rape exception. This means sexual intercourse within marriage is not considered rape even if the wife is below 18.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the amendment raised the age of consent to 18, there were exceptions in the IPC, specifically regarding marital rape, which have since been addressed (partially) through judicial interpretation and subsequent legislation.

Therefore, only two statements (2 and partially 1, considering the dominant age of 18) accurately reflect the complexities surrounding the age of consent.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on LGBTQIA+ rights in the Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs Union of India case:**

1.  The court unanimously recognized a fundamental right to same-sex marriage.
2.  The court allowed transgender persons in heterosexual relationships to marry under existing laws.
3.  The court mandated the government to recognize civil unions for queer couples.
4.  The court declined to interpret the Special Marriage Act (SMA) in a gender-neutral manner.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's ruling?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court did *not* unanimously recognize a fundamental right to same-sex marriage.  The judgment explicitly stated that there was no such fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct. The court affirmed the right of transgender individuals in heterosexual relationships to marry under existing laws.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The court explicitly rejected the idea of prescribing civil unions as an alternative to same-sex marriage, stating that it was not the court's role to dictate such policy choices.

Statement 4 is correct. The court refused to reinterpret the Special Marriage Act (SMA) in a gender-neutral way, citing the need to respect the legislative process and potential far-reaching consequences of such a judicial action.

Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the Supreme Court's decision.


**5. Consider the following features of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**

1.  It prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in healthcare but not in employment.
2.  It allows transgender persons to self-identify their gender but mandates a certificate from a district magistrate for recognition.
3.  It establishes a grievance redressal mechanism but doesn't specify the composition of the complaint officer.
4.  It guarantees the right of residence for transgender children but permits separation from their families under certain circumstances.

How many of the above statements correctly represent provisions within the Act?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons across various sectors, including employment, education, housing, and healthcare.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act allows for self-perception of gender identity but requires a certificate from a district magistrate for official recognition.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act establishes a grievance redressal mechanism, mandating that every establishment designate a complaint officer to handle complaints related to violations of the Act's provisions.

Statement 4 is correct. The Act protects transgender children's right to reside with their families, but allows for separation only through a court order in the child's best interest.

Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and 4) accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**6. Consider the following initiatives taken for the transgender community in India:**

1.  The SMILE scheme exclusively focuses on providing shelter homes for transgender persons.
2.  The National Portal for Transgender Persons is managed by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.
3.  The Prayatna project, mentioned in a NITI Aayog report, is a livelihood and enterprise training program.
4.  Garima Greh is an example of a skill development initiative for transgender individuals.

How many of the above statements accurately describe these initiatives?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise) scheme is a broader initiative encompassing both livelihood support and rehabilitation, not limited to shelter homes.  Shelter homes are one aspect addressed under the umbrella of SMILE.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The National Portal for Transgender Persons is launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment (MoSJE), not the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE).

Statement 3 is correct. The Prayatna project, as highlighted in the NITI Aayog report, indeed focuses on livelihood and enterprise training for transgender individuals.

Statement 4 is partially correct. Garima Greh is a shelter home, not solely a skill development initiative, though skill development might be offered as part of the support provided at the shelter.


Therefore, only two statements (3 and partially 4) accurately describe these initiatives.  The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2 stem from a misunderstanding of the scope and managing ministries of the different programs.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM JANMAN):**

1.  PM JANMAN was launched in the Union Budget 2022-23.
2.  It involves interventions from nine ministries with an estimated outlay of ₹24,104 crore for three years.
3.  It aims to saturate PVTG households with basic facilities like safe housing, clean drinking water, and sanitation.
4.  It excludes initiatives related to health and nutrition programs.

How many of the above statements correctly describe PM JANMAN?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PM JANMAN was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24, not 2022-23.  The timeline of its launch and announcement should be differentiated.

Statement 2 is correct.  PM JANMAN does involve 9 ministries and the estimated outlay mentioned is accurate.

Statement 3 is correct.  The goal of saturating PVTG households with basic amenities is a central aim of the initiative.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  PM JANMAN explicitly includes saturation for programs like Sickle Cell Disease Elimination, TB Elimination, and various nutrition initiatives under PM Poshan.  Health and nutrition are integral parts of the scheme.

Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and partially 1, if the budget announcement is considered) correctly describe PM JANMAN. The main inaccuracy lies in the budget year mentioned in statement 1.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Scheduled Tribes (ST) population in India:**

1.  The ST population constitutes less than 5% of India's total population (Census of India 2011).
2.  Lakshadweep has the lowest percentage of ST population.
3.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of STs.
4.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for ST welfare.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ST population in India, according to the 2011 Census, is 8.6%, which is significantly higher than 5%.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lakshadweep has the highest percentage of ST population, not the lowest.

Statement 3 is correct. Madhya Pradesh does have the highest absolute number of STs in India.

Statement 4 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes.

Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) are accurate. The errors in statements 1 and 2 relate to misrepresenting the population percentages and their distribution.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the Panchsheel Principles for tribal development:**

1.  They emphasize the imposition of alien values to accelerate tribal development.
2.  They advocate for respecting tribal rights to land and forests.
3.  They recommend against overwhelming tribal areas with numerous development schemes.
4.  They suggest judging development success solely through statistical data.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Panchsheel Principles?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Panchsheel Principles explicitly emphasize avoiding the imposition of alien values and respecting the unique culture and genius of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is correct.  Respect for tribal land and forest rights is a cornerstone of the principles.

Statement 3 is correct.  The principles caution against overwhelming tribal communities with a multiplicity of schemes, advocating for a more measured and sensitive approach.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The principles advocate for judging the quality of development based on the evolved human character, not just on statistical indicators.  A holistic assessment beyond mere numbers is emphasized.

Therefore, three statements (2, 3, and partially 1, as the principle states the opposite) accurately reflect the Panchsheel Principles.


**10. Consider the following key dimensions of Universal Health Coverage (UHC):**

1.  Accessibility of healthcare services.
2.  Affordability of healthcare services.
3.  Quality of healthcare services.
4.  Availability of specialized tertiary care only.

How many of the above are considered key dimensions of UHC?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Accessibility, ensuring that healthcare services are reachable for all members of the population, is a fundamental principle of UHC.

Statement 2 is correct. Affordability is equally critical, meaning that healthcare services shouldn't create undue financial hardship for individuals or families.

Statement 3 is correct.  Quality healthcare is essential; the services provided must be effective, safe, and meet appropriate standards.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While specialized tertiary care is important, UHC encompasses the *full continuum* of essential health services, from primary care and preventive measures to treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.  The focus is not limited to specialized care.

Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately represent the key dimensions of UHC.


**11. Consider the following initiatives taken to achieve Universal Health Coverage in India:**

1.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses solely on tertiary-level healthcare interventions.
2.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to improve access to quality healthcare using technology, but does not address national portability of health services.
3.  The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC and deliver quality healthcare services at an affordable cost.
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on reaching zero-dose children and pregnant women who have missed any vaccine doses.

How many of the above statements accurately describe these initiatives?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana takes a holistic approach, addressing health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  It's not limited to tertiary care.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ABDM explicitly aims to enable national portability of health services, facilitating seamless access across different locations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The National Health Policy 2017 has UHC as a central goal, aiming for affordable and quality healthcare.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush specifically targets children and pregnant women who may have missed vaccinations.


Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) accurately describe the initiatives.  The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2 stem from a misrepresentation of the scope of the Ayushman Bharat programs.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is solely responsible for providing early childhood care and education.
2.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a State-sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed honorarium but no performance-linked incentives.
4.  The Saksham Anganwadis initiative focuses exclusively on improving the nutritional status of children.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While early childhood care and development is a major component, the Anganwadi system also addresses the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. Its scope is broader than just early childhood education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored, under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).

Statement 3 is incorrect. AWWs and AWHs do receive performance-linked incentives in addition to their fixed honorarium.  The text mentions a performance-linked incentive of ₹500 per month for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyaan.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Saksham Anganwadis has a broader focus, including adolescent girls, early childhood care and education, and early stimulation for children aged 0-3 years.  It is not solely focused on children's nutrition.


Therefore, only none of the statements are entirely correct.  All four statements contain inaccuracies, mostly related to the scope and details of the Anganwadi system and associated initiatives.


**13. Consider the following statements about the  'Triple Threat' report released by UNICEF related to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH):**

1.  The report focuses on the challenges faced by adults related to WASH.
2.  It identifies countries with less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services as facing a 'triple threat'.
3.  India is not included among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under 5.
4.  The report considers the risk of climate and environmental hazards in assessing the 'triple threat'.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the findings of the UNICEF report?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNICEF 'Triple Threat' report specifically examines the WASH-related threats faced by *children*, not adults.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report defines the 'triple threat' by including countries with less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report highlights that India is among the top 20 countries with a high burden of WASH-attributable deaths in children under five.  This is a significant finding of the report.

Statement 4 is correct. The report does consider the risk of climate and environmental hazards in its assessment of the 'triple threat,' recognizing the interplay between environmental factors and WASH challenges.

Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the UNICEF report's findings.


**14. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are among the regions with the highest hunger levels.
3.  India's GHI score in 2023 reflects a significant worsening compared to 2015.
4.  The Indian government has not raised any objections to the GHI methodology.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the GHI 2023?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Food Programme (WFP).

Statement 2 is correct.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are indeed identified as regions with high hunger levels in the 2023 GHI report.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India's GHI score shows a slight *improvement* compared to 2015, not a worsening.  The score decreased slightly.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Indian government has raised objections regarding the GHI methodology, data sources, and sample size.


Therefore, only two statements (2) are correct. The inaccuracies in statements 1, 3, and 4 highlight the need to understand the origins and interpretations of the GHI report accurately.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in India:**

1.  ODF Plus status requires the sustained ODF status and implementation of only solid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus Model village must have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
3.  Visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and no plastic waste dumps, is a criterion for ODF Plus Model villages.
4.  ODF status is defined by the presence of visible faeces in the environment.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding ODF Plus status?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ODF Plus requires sustained ODF status and implementation of *either* solid or liquid waste management systems, not necessarily both.

Statement 2 is correct. An ODF Plus Model village requires arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.

Statement 3 is correct. Visual cleanliness, including the absence of litter and plastic waste, is a key criterion for ODF Plus Model villages.

Statement 4 is incorrect. ODF status is defined by the *absence* of visible faeces in the environment, indicating successful sanitation practices.

Therefore, three statements (2, 3) are correct.  The error in statement 1 highlights a misunderstanding of the flexibility in waste management requirements for ODF Plus villages.  The error in statement 4 involves a reversal of the meaning of ODF status.



**1. Consider the following statements related to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  It aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.
2.  It proposes a 3-year undergraduate degree structure with no exit options after the first or second year.
3.  It mandates the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country.
4.  It advocates for the complete elimination of vocational education at the secondary level.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NEP 2020 explicitly targets a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.  This is a key objective to expand access to higher education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NEP 2020 proposes undergraduate degrees of either 3 or 4 years duration, *with* multiple exit options. Students can exit after the first year with a certificate, after the second year with a diploma, and after the third year with a Bachelor's degree.  A four-year program leads to an honors degree.

Statement 3 is correct.  The policy emphasizes the establishment of MERUs to foster interdisciplinary learning and research, aligning with its holistic approach to education.

Statement 4 is incorrect. NEP 2020 significantly emphasizes vocational education, integrating it seamlessly with academic streams at the secondary stage and beyond,  promoting skill development alongside academic learning.  It does not advocate for its elimination.


**2. Consider the following features of the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  It assesses performance at the state and district levels using UDISE+ data and NAS results.
2.  It grades states/UTs and districts into ten grades, with 'Daksh' being the highest and 'Akanshi-3' the lowest.
3.  The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 showed that all states/UTs achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').
4.  PGI-D focuses exclusively on the financial aspects of school education.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PGI utilizes data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both state and district levels.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGI employs a ten-grade system, ranging from 'Daksh' (highest) to 'Akanshi-3' (lowest), providing a comprehensive performance ranking.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2021-22 PGI 2.0 report explicitly states that *no* state/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').  This highlights the challenges in achieving excellence across all aspects of school education.

Statement 4 is incorrect. PGI-D considers a broader range of factors beyond just finances.  It includes aspects like outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety, providing a more holistic assessment of the school education system.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status are prohibited from starting new courses or programs without explicit permission from the central government.
3.  The NCERT was recently granted DtBU status.
4.  DtBU status automatically grants an institution complete autonomy over all aspects of its operations.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant change introduced by the 2023 regulations is the reduction of the minimum age requirement for applying for DtBU status from 20 years to less than 20 years, making it more accessible to newer institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While approval from relevant statutory councils is often required,  the 2023 regulations state that DtBUs may start new courses or programs with the prior approval of their Executive Council and, where applicable, relevant statutory councils.  This allows for greater internal autonomy in curriculum development.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCERT's recent elevation to DtBU status is a notable development, granting it the authority to offer its own degrees and enhancing its autonomy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While DtBU status grants significant autonomy, it does not provide absolute freedom over all aspects of operations.  There are still regulations and oversight mechanisms in place to ensure quality and adherence to standards.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher education institutions, promoting inclusive access to higher education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act mandates 4% reservation in government jobs, this *does not* include police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police).  This exclusion reflects specific operational requirements of police forces.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act significantly broadens the definition of disability, recognizing 21 types, ensuring a more comprehensive coverage of individuals with diverse needs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act explicitly guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities (at least 40% disability) between the ages of 6 and 18, either in neighborhood schools or specialized schools as per their choice.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The government initially recognized PVTGs in 1973 under the name Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), based on recommendations from the Dhebar Commission.  Statement 2 is also correct; Odisha does indeed house the highest number of PVTGs in India (13). Statement 3 is accurate as well;  the criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect provisions within the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The Act does stipulate a minimum 4% reservation in government jobs (not 5%),  it recognizes 21 types of disabilities, encompassing acid attack victims, and it guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Act's reservation policy does *not* apply to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police). Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly reflect key aspects of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013. The Act explicitly prohibits employing individuals for cleaning human waste without proper protective gear,  it mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines, and it outlines provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial aid, and property assistance.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  Safal Karamcharis, while employed as sweepers or cleaning workers, are *still* considered manual scavengers if they handle undecomposed human waste without proper safety measures.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following measures undertaken by the Indian government for the welfare of Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of government initiatives for DNT welfare. The NCDNT does indeed compile a state-wise list of DNT castes. The SEED scheme provides free coaching for competitive exams and health insurance to DNT families.  Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated annually on August 31st by DNT communities. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme is specifically for DNTs *not* covered under SC/ST/OBC categories,  providing educational support to those not already benefiting from other reservation-based schemes.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect features of the NCF-SE. It does employ a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure, and it strongly promotes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NCF-SE allows students to take board exams twice in a school year for Grades 10 and 12, retaining the best score. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NCF-SE advocates for flexibility and choice, *not* a strict separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

4. The 2021 amendment to the Act introduced changes to the definition of "serious offences".

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act does categorize juvenile offences,  adoption is finalized via a civil court order under the original Act, and the 2021 amendment did modify the definition of "serious offences". However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Act defines a child as someone under 18, with a provision allowing 16-18-year-olds to be tried as adults for heinous crimes.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

Statement 1 is correct: NCF-SE does propose the 5+3+3+4 structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect: NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least *three* languages, not four.

Statement 3 is correct:  The framework does allow for two attempts at board exams in Grades 10 and 12.

Statement 4 is correct:  The integration of Indian contributions to knowledge is a stated aim.

Statement 5 is incorrect: NCF-SE explicitly aims to *remove* hard separations between academic and vocational subjects.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 3, and 4) accurately reflect NCF-SE.

4. The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.
5.  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the lowest GHI scores globally.


How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Food Programme.

Statement 2 is incorrect: A higher GHI score indicates *worse* hunger levels; 0 is the worst, and 100 is the best.

Statement 3 is correct: The GHI 2023 did rank India among the countries with serious hunger levels.

Statement 4 is correct: The Indian government has voiced concerns about the GHI's methodology and data.

Statement 5 is incorrect: South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by some of the *highest*, not lowest, GHI scores, indicating high levels of hunger.

Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4, and, by correction, 2) are factually accurate.

Statement 4 is incorrect: The Dr. Ambedkar scholarships are specifically for DNTs who are not covered under SC/ST/OBC categories, not all STs.

Statement 5 is correct: The Development and Welfare Board's establishment in 2019 is accurately stated.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) accurately describe the initiatives.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):

1. It was established in 1971 as a major research center.
2. Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. It focuses on research-based policy solutions for poverty reduction, hunger, and malnutrition.
4. It operates in over 60 countries, including India.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 3 is correct; IFPRI provides research-based policy solutions to alleviate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Statement 4 is also correct; IFPRI operates in over 60 countries, including India. However, statement 1 is incorrect; IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; its headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva. Therefore, only two statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly similar statements.  The close proximity of the establishment year (1971 vs 1975) and the headquarters location (Geneva vs Washington D.C.) serve as effective distractors.


2. Consider the following regarding the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):

1. It was established by the UN General Assembly in 1960.
2. Its headquarters are in New York City.
3. Its primary focus is on aiding refugees and asylum seekers.
4. It works with countries to improve and monitor refugee and asylum laws.
5. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are irrelevant to its work.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNHCR?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are accurate descriptions of UNHCR's mandate: providing aid to refugees and asylum seekers and collaborating with nations to enhance refugee and asylum legislation.  Statement 4 is correct; UNHCR works with countries to improve and monitor these laws. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational to UNHCR's work.  However, statements 1, 2, and 5 are incorrect. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1960; its headquarters are in Geneva, not New York City; and the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol are central to its operations.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of international organizations.  The incorrect statements provide plausible yet false information, increasing the difficulty level.



3. Consider the following organizations:

1.  Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI)
2.  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)
4.  National Medical Commission (NMC)

Which of the above organizations are primarily involved in issuing reports related to global trends and development?
(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** GANHRI, while involved in accreditation and human rights monitoring, does not primarily focus on issuing reports on global trends.  UNFPA regularly publishes reports on population trends, including the State of World Population report. The WFP releases reports on food crises and global hunger.  NMC is a regulatory body focused on medical education and practice in India; it does not produce global development reports.  Therefore, only UNFPA and WFP consistently issue reports on global trends and development making (c) the correct answer. The inclusion of NMC as a plausible distractor increases question difficulty. The question assesses understanding of the roles and functions of different international and national organizations.



4. Consider the following statements about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):

1.  It was last revised in 2010.
2.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling.
3.  It emphasizes vocational education starting at the secondary stage.
4.  It mandates the use of only two languages in school education.
5. It promotes multilingualism, with students aiming for proficiency in at least three languages.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the key features of the NCF-SE?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 accurately describes the NCF-SE's proposed schooling structure (5+3+3+4). Statement 5 correctly highlights the NCF-SE's promotion of multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the last revision was in 2005, not 2010. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; while it promotes vocational education, it proposes integration at various stages, not solely at the secondary level. Statement 4 is incorrect; it promotes multilingualism, not restricting students to two languages. The question tests factual recall and understanding of educational policy. The inclusion of partially true and entirely false statements serves as effective distractors.


5. Consider the following concerning the National Family Health Survey (NFHS):

1. NFHS-5 data indicated that spousal abuse was most prevalent in Karnataka.
2. NFHS is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
3. NFHS data provides insights into maternal and child health indicators.
4. NFHS reports are released annually.
5. NFHS data includes information on the prevalence of domestic violence.

How many of these statements are accurate regarding the NFHS?
(a) Only two (b) Only three (c) Only four (d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. NFHS-5 data indeed showed higher spousal abuse rates in Karnataka compared to other states.  NFHS comprehensively covers maternal and child health indicators.  The surveys also collect data on domestic violence against women. However, statement 2 is incorrect; although the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare uses the data, the survey is conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  Statement 4 is also incorrect; NFHS surveys are not conducted annually but periodically.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of health data sources. The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately false information, enhancing the difficulty.


6. Consider the following regarding the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:

1.  It defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  It provides criminal penalties for perpetrators of domestic violence.
3.  It covers only legally married women.
4.  It allows for the provision of shelter and medical aid to victims.
5.  It mandates the establishment of special courts to handle domestic violence cases.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PWDVA, 2005?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is entirely accurate. The PWDVA, 2005, does include provisions for providing shelter and medical aid to victims of domestic violence. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect; it primarily provides for civil remedies, not criminal penalties. Statement 3 is incorrect; it covers women in various domestic relationships, not just legally married women. Statement 5 is incorrect; while it encourages speedy resolution, it doesn't mandate the establishment of special courts. The question tests knowledge of legislation and its provisions.  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate interpretations of the Act.


7. Consider the following concerning the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):

1. It aims to achieve 100% sanitation coverage in rural areas.
2. "ODF Plus" status signifies sustained ODF status with additional waste management systems.
3. ODF Plus Model villages must have arrangements for solid waste management, but liquid waste management is optional.
4. The Swachh Bharat Mission is solely a centrally funded scheme.
5.  Monitoring of the Swachh Bharat Mission is done exclusively through physical inspections.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the objectives and features of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status and ODF Plus status in rural areas. ODF Plus involves sustained ODF status along with implementing solid and/or liquid waste management systems. However, statement 3 is incorrect; ODF Plus Model villages require both solid and liquid waste management systems. Statement 4 is incorrect; it's a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning both the central and state governments share funding. Statement 5 is incorrect; while physical inspections are important, technology and data are also used for monitoring. The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their implementation.  The incorrect options are designed to be plausible but factually inaccurate.


8. Consider the following statements about the Global Hunger Index (GHI):

1.  It is published annually by the World Health Organization.
2.  India's GHI score consistently shows improvement year after year.
3.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment and child mortality.
4.  The methodology of the GHI has never been subject to criticism.
5.  The GHI is calculated by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Global Hunger Index (GHI)?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 5 are correct. The GHI does include indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, wasting, and child mortality.  It is also jointly published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it is not published by the WHO. Statement 2 is incorrect; while there might be some fluctuations, the overall trend is not consistently upward. Statement 4 is incorrect; the GHI's methodology has faced criticism regarding data sources and methodology. This question assesses understanding of global indices and their limitations.  The inclusion of partially correct and entirely false statements increases the difficulty level.


9. Consider the following regarding the  United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):

1. It was established in 1990.
2. It is a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
3. Its membership consists solely of government-nominated experts.
4. It focuses exclusively on indigenous peoples' cultural issues.
5. It's one of several UN bodies dealing with Indigenous Peoples' issues.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNPFII?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 5 are correct. The UNPFII is indeed a subsidiary body of ECOSOC, and it's one of several UN bodies dedicated to Indigenous Peoples' issues. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it was established in 2000, not 1990. Statement 3 is incorrect; its membership includes experts nominated by both governments and indigenous organizations. Statement 4 is incorrect; its mandate covers economic, social, cultural, environmental, educational, health, and human rights issues related to indigenous peoples. This question tests knowledge of UN bodies and their functions.  The incorrect statements provide plausible but factually incorrect information.


10. Consider the following statements related to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India:

1.  The UGC Act of 1956 provides the legal basis for declaring institutions as DTBUs.
2.  Only institutions older than 20 years are eligible to apply for DTBU status.
3.  DTBUs are not permitted to offer online or distance learning programs.
4.  The Ministry of Education is the primary regulatory body for DTBUs.
5. DTBUs are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding DTBUs in India?
(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 4, and 5 are correct. The UGC Act 1956 empowers the central government to declare institutions as DTBUs. The Ministry of Education plays a crucial regulatory role.  DTBUs are mandated to create ABC identities for their students. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the eligibility criteria have been revised, allowing institutions less than 20 years old to apply. Statement 3 is incorrect; while some restrictions may apply, DTBUs are not categorically prohibited from offering online or distance learning programs. This question tests understanding of higher education regulations in India.  The incorrect statements present plausible but outdated or inaccurate information.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):**

1. It was established in 1971 as a part of the CGIAR.
2. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C., USA.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding IFPRI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IFPRI is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), CGIAR itself was established in 1971, and IFPRI was founded later, in 1975.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect IFPRI's characteristics.  Its headquarters are indeed in Washington, D.C., it works across numerous countries including India, and its core mission includes addressing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition through research-driven policy solutions.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNHCR report actually showed a 21% increase in forced displacement in 2022 compared to 2021. Statement 2 is correct; the report highlighted that a substantial portion (30%) of forcibly displaced individuals were children. Statement 3 is also correct; the report indicated that a large majority (76%) of the world's refugees are hosted in low- and middle-income countries. Statement 4 is incorrect; the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents guiding the UNHCR's operations.  Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the report's findings.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):**

How many of the statements above correctly describe GANHRI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; GANHRI's origins align with the description provided. Statement 2 is incorrect; GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City. Statement 3 is correct; GANHRI's accreditation process is indeed guided by the Paris Principles. Statement 4 is incorrect; the passage explicitly states that GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation, even twice.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe GANHRI.


**4. Consider the following concerning the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

1. The UNPFII was established in 1990.
2.  It's a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNPFII?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII was established in July 2000, not 1990. Statement 2 is correct; it functions as a high-level advisory body to ECOSOC. Statement 3 is incorrect; its membership includes experts nominated by both governments and indigenous organizations. Statement 4 is correct; its mandate encompasses the wide range of indigenous issues listed.  Therefore, only three statements correctly describe the UNPFII.


**5. Consider the following regarding the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. The GHI is published annually by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
2.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels.

4. The GHI score for India in 2023 indicates a significant worsening of the hunger situation compared to 2015.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the 2023 GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank and IMF. Statement 2 is correct; South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently rank poorly. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Indian government has expressed objections to the GHI's methodology and data sources. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the 2023 score was still in the "serious" category, it represented a slight improvement compared to 2015. Thus, only two statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Anganwadi system in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system encompasses early childhood care and development beyond just nutrition.  Statement 2 is incorrect; AWWs and AWHs do receive performance-linked incentives. Statement 3 is correct; Saksham Anganwadi focuses on upgrading AWCs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system is integral to the POSHAN Abhiyan.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.

How many of the statements above accurately describe aspects of UHC in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; this is the core definition of UHC. Statement 2 is incorrect; Ayushman Bharat Yojana addresses health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Statement 3 is incorrect; the National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims for UHC. Statement 4 is correct; this is the precise target of the Intensified Mission Indradhanush. Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements related to India's caste census:**

1.  The census is a state subject under the Indian Constitution.
2.  Caste-wise enumeration of the population was consistently conducted until the 1941 census.
3.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, included caste data in its final published report.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning India's caste census?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the census is a Union subject. Statement 2 is partially correct; caste data was collected until 1931, not 1941, though the 1941 data was collected but not published. Statement 3 is incorrect; the final published report of the SECC, 2011, excluded caste data. Statement 4 is correct; the Mandal Commission's estimate is accurate. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

**How many of the above statements are accurate?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Anganwadi system falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; it covers children aged 0-6 years, not just 0-5.

The World Food Programme (WFP) publishes reports on food crises and related issues. UNDESA (United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs) releases reports related to sustainable development goals, which include population and economic aspects. The UN Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD) monitors and reviews population trends and development issues.  Therefore, all four organizations have released relevant reports.


**9. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1.  Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission
2.  PM JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan)
3.  National Child Labour Project (NCLP)
4.  SMILE (Support for Marginalised Individuals for Livelihood and Enterprise)


Which of these initiatives are primarily focused on the welfare of tribal populations in India?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri PVTG Development Mission and PM JANMAN are explicitly designed to improve the lives of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and tribal communities in general. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) addresses child labour issues across various populations, not solely tribal groups. SMILE is a broader scheme focusing on marginalized individuals, including transgender people, but not exclusively tribal communities.  Therefore, only initiatives 1 and 2 are primarily focused on tribal welfare.


**10. Consider the following features of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  Establishment of the National Research Foundation (NRF)
2.  Introduction of the National Credit Framework (NCrF)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 includes the establishment of the NRF to boost research. It introduces the NCrF to streamline credit accumulation and transfer. The policy sets a target of 50% GER in higher education by 2035. However, the three-language policy is a suggestion, not a mandate.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate key features.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The highest number of PVTGs in India is found in Odisha.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The government initially designated these groups as PTGs in 1973, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission.  Statement 2 is also correct; Odisha houses the largest number of PVTGs. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Statement 4 is correct.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs indeed include a pre-agricultural level of technology and a declining or stagnant population, along with low literacy and economic backwardness.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; the Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18. Statement 4 is correct.  The reservation policy does not apply to the police forces mentioned.  Therefore, three of the features are accurately described.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment or a fine of ₹1 lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  It defines manual scavengers as only those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.
3.  It mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act does specify the given punishments for violations. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Act primarily focuses on handling undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, its scope extends to other forms of manual scavenging as well.  Statement 3 is correct. The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines. Statement 4 is correct; the Act considers Safal karamcharis, who work as sweepers or cleaning workers, as manual scavengers if they handle human waste without appropriate protective gear. Thus, three statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling.
2.  It mandates the study of at least three languages, with two Indian languages being compulsory.
3.  It introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as either "Accredited" or "Not Accredited".
4.  It recommends board examinations for Grades 10 and 12 only once per academic year.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCF-SE proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling. Statement 2 is partially correct. While it encourages multilingualism and proficiency in at least three languages, it does not strictly mandate two Indian languages.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE does not directly address school accreditation; that falls under the purview of other bodies. Statement 4 is incorrect. The NCF-SE allows students to take board exams twice a year, retaining the best score. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of Scheduled Tribes in absolute numbers.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NFHS-5 is conducted under the aegis of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Statement 2 is correct. The report provides crucial data on maternal mortality rates. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NFHS-5 covers both rural and urban populations, providing a comprehensive national picture. Statement 4 is correct.  The survey measures various indicators related to child malnutrition, such as stunting and wasting.  Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe aspects of the NFHS-5 report.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It is published annually by the United Nations.
2.  It ranks countries based on four key indicators.
3.  India's ranking has consistently improved over the years.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the United Nations.  Statement 2 is correct. The GHI uses four key indicators: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality. Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's score has shown slight improvements, it has not consistently improved over the years. Statement 4 is correct. Child mortality is a key indicator in the GHI.  Therefore, only two of the statements accurately describe the GHI.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI):**

1.  It is jointly released by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank.
2.  It measures the progress toward achieving SDG 3.8.1.

4.  India's SCI score has consistently increased in recent years.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UHC SCI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UHC SCI is indeed a joint publication of WHO and the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct. It tracks progress towards SDG 3.8.1, which relates to health services. Statement 3 is correct.  The SCI includes indicators related to the health of mothers, newborns, and children. Statement 4 is incorrect. India's SCI score has fluctuated and not consistently increased. Therefore, three statements accurately describe the UHC SCI.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act wrongly labeled certain communities as inherently criminal. Statement 3 is correct. August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Idate Commission, not the Renke Commission, recommended a permanent commission for DNTs.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a credit system divided into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 representing higher education.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCrF aims to seamlessly integrate credits from various educational pathways. Statement 2 is incorrect. Levels 1-4 represent school education, not higher education.  Statement 3 is correct. The NHEQF is one of the frameworks integrated within the NCrF. Statement 4 is incorrect. The NCrF actually promotes lifelong learning by enabling credit transfer and multiple entry/exit options.  Therefore, only two statements correctly describe the NCrF.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to the specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India.
4.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  PVTGs were indeed first recognized in 1973 as PTGs, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission. The criteria for PVTG identification include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. Odisha does currently have the highest number of PVTGs. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  This detail makes statement 4 a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of the Bharia PVTG.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities.
4.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day, and the Renke Commission did provide the population estimate. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are categorized as DNTs. This distinction makes statement 1 a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the terminology and categorization.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The Act mandates at least a 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to the age of 16.
4.  The Act's reservation policy applies to all police forces in India.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2 are correct. The RPwD Act does mandate at least a 4% reservation in government jobs (not 5%), and it does recognize 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; free education is provided up to age 18, not 16.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the reservation policy explicitly excludes certain police forces.  These subtle inaccuracies in the statements create a challenging question that demands precise recall of the Act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle decomposed human waste.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The PEMSR Act does mandate the construction of community sanitary latrines, provides for rehabilitation, and makes it an offense to clean sewers without protective gear. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle *undecomposed* human waste. The subtle difference in the wording of statement 1 creates a challenging distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall the exact definition within the Act.


**5. Consider the following statements related to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 50% by 2035.
2.  NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. NEP 2020 does aim for a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, proposes the 5+3+3+4 structure, and mandates the creation of PARAKH.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; NEP 2020 explicitly *rejects* rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects, advocating for flexibility and integration. The inclusion of this contradictory statement makes the question more difficult and tests the candidate's understanding of the policy's core principles.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1. The NRF is primarily financed through grants and loans from state governments.
2. The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the Governing Board, and the NRF does subsume SERB. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NRF is primarily financed through central government grants, not state government grants. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Department of Science and Technology is the administrative department, not the Department of Higher Education.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect funding and administrative details makes this question challenging.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The GHI does include indicators like undernourishment, child stunting, and child mortality, and the Indian government has indeed voiced concerns regarding the GHI's methodology. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. Statement 3 is also incorrect; South Asia consistently ranks among the regions with the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels.  The subtle but significant errors in statements 1 and 3 make this a challenging question.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1. It is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2. It assesses parameters such as economic participation and political empowerment.
3. India consistently ranks among the top 20 countries in the index.
4. The index considers educational attainment as a key parameter.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Global Gender Gap Index does indeed assess economic participation and political empowerment, and educational attainment is a key parameter. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it's released by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP. Statement 3 is also incorrect; India's ranking is not consistently among the top 20, it usually falls significantly lower.  The combination of correct and incorrect statements, along with the relatively low ranking of India, makes this a demanding question.


These questions demonstrate the application of factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills, requiring precise knowledge and the ability to discern subtle differences in information to arrive at the correct answer.  The distractors are carefully chosen to make the questions challenging and representative of the difficulty level expected in a UPSC examination.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test factual recall, analysis, and potentially interdisciplinary understanding.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
3.  It integrates contributions to knowledge by Indians from ancient to contemporary times.
4.  It strictly separates academic and vocational subjects.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of the NCF-SE's key highlights. The framework does indeed propose a revised 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the older four-stage system.  It emphasizes multilingualism, advocating for proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages to promote linguistic diversity and cultural understanding.  Furthermore, the NCF-SE explicitly integrates contributions to various disciplines by Indians throughout history, fostering a sense of national pride and showcasing the rich intellectual heritage of the country.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The NCF-SE explicitly rejects rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects, promoting a more integrated and flexible approach to learning that caters to diverse interests and skills.  This integrated approach aims to break down traditional barriers between academic disciplines and vocational training, allowing students to pursue their passions and develop a well-rounded skillset.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  It assesses performance at the state and district levels.
2.  It utilizes UDISE+ data and NAS data for its assessment.
3.  The highest grade, "Daksh," was achieved by several states/UTs in the 2021-22 assessment.
4.  PGI 2.0 was first released for the year 2017-18.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The PGI is designed to evaluate the performance of the school education system at both the state and district levels, providing a comprehensive assessment of educational quality across different geographical areas. The index leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS), integrating multiple data sources to create a robust evaluation framework.  The PGI 2.0 was indeed first released for the year 2017-18, marking a significant step towards improving the transparency and accountability of the school education system. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  In the 2021-22 assessment, *no* state/UT achieved the highest grade, "Daksh."  This highlights the ongoing challenges and the need for continuous improvement in the quality of school education across the country.


**3. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It uses a system of eight levels to categorize educational attainment.
3.  It mandates the use of the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) for all credits earned.
4.  It strictly limits entry and exit points within the education system.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The NCrF aims to create a seamless integration of credits earned across different educational pathways, promoting flexibility and mobility for learners.  The framework employs an eight-level system for categorizing educational attainment, providing a clear structure for credit accumulation and transfer. The NCrF also makes use of the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), a digital platform for storing and managing academic credits earned by students. This ensures that credits earned through various programs and institutions are recognized and transferable, fostering lifelong learning opportunities. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly promotes multiple entry and exit options within the educational system, allowing individuals to enter, exit, and re-enter at various points in their educational journey. This flexibility caters to diverse learning styles and circumstances, promoting lifelong learning and skill development.


**4. Consider the following regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs):**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status.
2.  A cluster of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies can apply for DtbU status.
3.  DtbUs require prior approval from the UGC to start any new courses.
4.  The NCERT was recently granted DtbU status, allowing it to offer its own degrees.

How many of the above statements are correct about the recent changes in DtbU regulations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the updated regulations concerning Deemed-to-be Universities. The 2023 regulations significantly lowered the age requirement, allowing institutions younger than 20 years to apply for DtbU status, opening up opportunities for newer, high-performing institutions. The regulations also permit clusters of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies to seek DtbU status, encouraging collaboration and resource-sharing.  DtbUs still need UGC approval before introducing new courses, ensuring quality control and alignment with national educational standards. Finally, the NCERT's recent granting of DtbU status is a notable development, allowing this crucial institution to directly offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs, enhancing its influence on educational standards and research.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  They permit surrogacy using donor gametes if the intending couple has a medical condition.
2.  They allow single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor sperm and their own eggs.
3.  They explicitly permit commercial surrogacy under certain circumstances.
4.  They were enacted in response to the Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India Supreme Court case.

Which of the statements accurately reflect the key features of the Surrogacy Amendment Rules?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules allow for surrogacy using donor gametes when a medical condition necessitates it, provided at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.  The rules also provide a pathway for single women (widows or divorcees) to utilize surrogacy with donor sperm and their own eggs.  The amendments were indeed a direct response to the Supreme Court's decision in Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India, which addressed the rights of women with specific medical conditions to access surrogacy.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments strictly prohibit commercial surrogacy, emphasizing the ethical and altruistic aspects of the practice.


**6. Consider the following regarding the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It prohibits the employment of individuals to handle human excreta by hand from insanitary latrines.
2.  It mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3.  It provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial aid.
4.  It explicitly excludes "Safal karamcharis" from its definition of manual scavengers.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the key provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals for manual scavenging—the practice of removing human excreta by hand from insanitary latrines, sewers, or septic tanks.  The act also includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, providing them with alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and support in securing housing and other essential resources.  However, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. While the act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their demolition within a fixed timeframe; it focuses on converting them to sanitary facilities.  Furthermore, "Safal karamcharis," those working as sweepers or cleaning workers, are *included* under the definition of manual scavengers if they are involved in handling human waste without proper protective equipment.


**7. Consider the following about the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013:**

1.  It establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces with 10 or more employees.
2.  Complaints must be filed within three months of the incident, although extensions are possible.
3.  Monetary settlements are permitted as a means of conciliation.
4.  The Act mandates the public disclosure of the identities of those involved in complaints.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Act's provisions?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Act mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees to handle complaints of sexual harassment.  It also sets a three-month time limit for filing complaints, although the ICC can grant extensions under certain circumstances.  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a means of conciliation in sexual harassment cases, emphasizing the seriousness of such offenses and the need for appropriate redressal.  Furthermore, the Act strongly emphasizes the protection of the privacy of those involved, prohibiting the public disclosure of identities and other sensitive information.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  It shows little progress in reducing global hunger since 2015.
2.  India's GHI score improved significantly compared to 2015.
3.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest hunger levels.
4.  India's ranking reflects its high levels of child stunting and wasting.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the GHI 2023 report?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent key findings from the GHI 2023. The report highlights the stagnation in global hunger reduction efforts since 2015, attributing this to various crises like the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa are consistently identified as regions with the most severe hunger challenges.  India's ranking in the GHI reflects its relatively high prevalence of child stunting and wasting, underscoring the need for improved nutrition and healthcare interventions.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did improve slightly compared to 2015, the improvement was not significant, and India still faces a serious hunger challenge.

3.  The World Food Programme (WFP) received over 75% of its operating funding for 2023.
4.  The UNHCR released the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’.

How many of the above statements correctly match the organization with its recent activity?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly link the organizations with their recent activities. The UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) did release the India Ageing Report 2023, highlighting key demographic trends in India.  UNDESA (UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs) released the SDG Progress Report 2023, providing an update on global progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.  The UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) published the ‘Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report’, documenting the global situation of forced displacement.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The World Food Programme (WFP) received *less* than half of its required operating funding for 2023, highlighting the funding challenges faced by this crucial humanitarian organization.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The NETF is indeed conceptualized as a forum for sharing ideas and best practices on leveraging technology to enhance education.  The NEP 2020 explicitly mandates its establishment to promote the effective integration of technology across all levels of education.  Its scope includes improving learning, assessment, and administrative processes in both schools and higher education institutions.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NETF's impact will be felt in higher education, its mandate is broader, encompassing both school and higher education to ensure a more comprehensive and equitable approach to technology integration.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act's scope extends to women in both organized and unorganized sectors, including those in various employment statuses and even those who are clients, customers, or domestic workers. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the POSH Act.

The 2021 amendment did redefine "serious offenses" to align with Supreme Court recommendations in the Shilpa Mittal case. Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Act designates Children's Courts for certain offenses, not all offenses committed by juveniles are mandatorily tried there.  The categorization depends on the severity of the offense. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act does include acid attack victims among the 21 recognized disabilities. Statement 3 is partially incorrect.  Free education is mandated for children with "benchmark disabilities," meaning those with at least 40% of a specified disability.  Statement 4 is correct. The RPwD Act specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy. Therefore, statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the RPwD Act.


**9. Consider the following about the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5):**

1. NFHS-5 data indicated that spousal abuse was most prevalent in Manipur.
2. NFHS-5 reported that approximately 30% of ever-married women aged 18-49 experienced spousal violence.
3. NFHS-5 was conducted in 2020-2022.
4. NFHS-5 data included information on the prevalence of dowry-related deaths.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect findings or aspects of the NFHS-5?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 data showed variations across states, Karnataka, not Manipur, reported the highest percentage of spousal abuse. Statement 2 is correct.  NFHS-5 indeed indicated that around 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 experienced spousal violence. Statement 3 is incorrect.  NFHS-5 was conducted between 2019 and 2021. Statement 4 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 gathered data on various forms of violence against women, it did not directly collect data specifically on dowry-related deaths.  The data on violence against women could be indirectly interpreted to include such cases but is not directly linked to it. Therefore, only statements 2 is accurate.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  PVTGs were initially recognized as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
4.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 is correct; PVTGs were initially recognized as PTGs in 1973. Statement 3 is also correct; the criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while Madhya Pradesh has the highest *absolute number* of STs, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 4 is therefore also correct.  Thus, only two statements are correct.  The question plays on the subtle difference between the highest absolute number of STs and the highest number of PVTGs, a common trap in UPSC-style questions.


**2. Consider the following statements about De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorized DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 is correct: The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled certain communities as "born criminals," which later became known as DNTs. Statement 3 is also correct: The Renke Commission estimated the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes to be around 1,500.  Statement 4 is correct: August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. However, statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs, but all DNTs are nomadic tribes. Therefore, three statements are accurate. The question uses a potentially confusing relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes to test the candidate's knowledge.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act provides for free education for all children with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18.
4.  The Act's reservation policy applies to all police forces in India.

Which of the statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, recognizes 21 types of disabilities, and it guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities (at least 40% disability) between the ages of 6 and 18. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the reservation policy does *not* apply to police forces. The question uses slightly inaccurate figures and a specific exception to the reservation policy to increase difficulty.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act prohibits the employment of individuals to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.
2.  The Act criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines.
3.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial aid.
4.  The Act exempts individuals cleaning human waste with protective gear from its purview.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements correctly describe aspects of the PEMSR Act. The act specifically targets the employment of manual scavengers in insanitary conditions, criminalizes the construction of such latrines, and mandates rehabilitation efforts.  The exemption for those using protective gear is also a key provision.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the act's provisions.


**5. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for School Education, 2023:**

1.  The NCF emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.
2.  Environmental education is integrated into the curriculum at all stages.
3.  Interdisciplinary areas of study are introduced at the primary stage.
4.  The NCF mandates a separate subject of Environmental Studies at the Secondary Stage.


Which of the statements accurately reflect the NCF's approach?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the NCF's guidelines. The framework emphasizes scientific inquiry, integrates environmental education throughout the curriculum, and culminates in a separate area of study at the secondary stage. Statement 3 is incorrect; interdisciplinary areas of study are introduced at the *secondary* stage, not primary.  The question focuses on the specific stages at which certain educational components are introduced, a detail that requires careful reading of the NCF document.


**6. Consider the following statements about the National Medical Commission (NMC):**

1.  The NMC is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) accreditation is mandatory for all medical colleges in India.
3.  The NMC Act, 2019, repealed the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.
4.  The NMC oversees medical education and practice in India.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The NMC is a statutory body under the 2019 Act, and it regulates medical education and practice. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while WFME recognition provides benefits, it's not *mandatory* for all medical colleges. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NMC Act, 2019, replaced the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, it did not repeal it entirely.  The question tests understanding of the NMC's role and the legal framework surrounding it.  The subtle difference between replacement and repeal is a key distractor.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the National Credit Framework (NCF):**

1.  The NCF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  The NCF encompasses the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF).
3.  The NCF mandates a uniform credit system across all educational levels.
4.  The NCF is solely focused on higher education.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the NCF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The NCF aims to integrate credits across different educational streams, incorporates the NSQF, and seeks to create a more unified credit system. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NCF is not limited to higher education; it encompasses school and vocational education as well. The question tests knowledge of the NCF's scope and objectives.


**8. Consider the following about the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Anganwadi workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government.
2.  The Anganwadi system is primarily concerned with the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.
3.  AWWs are covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY).
4.  The Anganwadi system is a state-sponsored scheme.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. AWWs receive a fixed honorarium, the system focuses on the nutritional and health status of young children, and AWWs are covered under PMJJBY. However, statement 4 is incorrect; it is a *centrally sponsored* scheme, not state-sponsored.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the system's funding, beneficiaries, and social security provisions.


**9.  Consider the following regarding the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to improve access to healthcare at all levels.
2.  The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC.
3.  The Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving maternal health.
4.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) primarily focuses on traditional medicine.

How many of the statements accurately reflect initiatives related to UHC in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe initiatives related to UHC. Ayushman Bharat Yojana addresses healthcare across all levels, the National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims for UHC, and Mission Indradhanush, while encompassing maternal health, is more broadly focused on immunization, which is a crucial component of UHC.  Statement 4 is incorrect; ABDM uses technology to improve access to healthcare, not solely traditional medicine.  The question tests knowledge of specific government schemes and their roles in achieving UHC.


**10. Consider the following about the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  The GHI considers factors like undernourishment and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
4.  The GHI is calculated using data from multiple sources.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The GHI uses multiple indicators including undernourishment and child mortality, and it draws data from various sources. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while there might be some improvement, the statement of consistent improvement is an oversimplification.  The question uses slightly inaccurate information about the GHI's origin and trend to increase difficulty.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status:**

1. An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems.
2.  ODF Plus Model villages necessarily have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe aspects of ODF Plus status.  Sustained ODF status with waste management systems, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management in model villages, and visual cleanliness are all key criteria.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) is directly related to the achievement of ODF Plus status. The question tests detailed understanding of the ODF Plus criteria and its relationship to government programs.


**12. Consider the following statements about the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA):**

1.  The UNFPA's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
2.  The UNFPA's mandate includes ensuring sexual and reproductive rights.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNFPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The UNFPA focuses on sexual and reproductive rights and publishes the "State of World Population" report. However, statement 1 is incorrect; its headquarters are in New York. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it's a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly, not the Security Council.  The question tests specific details about the UNFPA's location, mandate, and publications.


**13. Consider the following about the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):**

1.  The NCPCR issues guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offences.
2. The NCPCR is a statutory body established under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.
3.  The NCPCR's primary focus is on the welfare of children in conflict with the law.
4. The NCPCR is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the NCPCR?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NCPCR issues guidelines for child suspects, focuses on child welfare, and falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while it works within the framework of the Juvenile Justice Act, it is not established under that act specifically.  The question tests knowledge of the NCPCR's functions and organizational placement.  The nuance regarding its legal establishment is a key distractor.


**14. Consider the following regarding the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1.  A child below 16 years of age can be tried as an adult for heinous offenses.
2.  The Act defines a "child" as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.
3.  The Act introduced provisions for the adoption of children.
4.  Appeals against orders made by Child Welfare Committees are not allowed.


Which of the statements correctly describe provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. The Act defines a child as someone below 18, and it does include adoption provisions.  Statement 1 is partially correct; children aged 16-18 can be tried as adults for heinous crimes, but the phrasing is inaccurate. Statement 4 is incorrect; the 2021 amendment allows appeals in some adoption cases.  The question uses slightly inaccurate phrasing and references amendments to increase the difficulty.


**15. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

1. The Act allows for commercial surrogacy.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The Act establishes the NARTSB, prohibits surrogacy for foreign nationals, and requires the surrogate mother's consent for abortion.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Act explicitly *prohibits* commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  The question tests specific knowledge of the act's provisions, particularly its stance on commercial surrogacy.

(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCrF aims to integrate credits across different educational pathways. Statement 3 is also correct; the framework incorporates the concept of "Notional Learning Hours." Statement 2 is incorrect; levels 1-4 represent school education, not higher education. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the UGC is involved, the NCrF is a joint initiative involving multiple bodies like AICTE, NCVET, NCERT, and relevant ministries.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
3.  It introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as "Accredited" or "Not Accredited."
4.  It integrates contributions from Indian scholars across various historical periods into the curriculum.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the NCF-SE's key highlights. The NCF-SE does indeed propose a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, aiming for multilingual proficiency (at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages), and integrates contributions from Indian scholars across history.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE advocates for a robust quality assessment system, it does not specifically introduce a binary "Accredited" or "Not Accredited" system for schools.  The accreditation system for schools is a separate matter, handled by different agencies and frameworks.  The NCF-SE focuses primarily on curriculum and pedagogical reforms.


**2. Consider the following features of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It integrates credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational training.
2.  It employs a credit system dividing education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 dedicated to school education.
3.  It mandates the storage of all earned credits in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).
4.  It introduces a "Notional Learning Hours" concept, fixing the total annual hours at 1200 for all educational streams.
5. It establishes a clear separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage.

How many of the above features are correctly attributed to the NCrF?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe features of the NCrF.

However, statement 5 is incorrect.  The NCrF, in line with NEP 2020, actually aims to reduce the rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects, promoting flexibility and multidisciplinary learning.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system:**

1.  It assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  It uses data from UDISE+ and NAS to classify states/UTs and districts into ten grades.
3.  In the PGI 2.0 report (2021-22), no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").
4.  The PGI-D report focuses solely on quantitative data related to student enrollment and infrastructure.
5. The PGI 2.0 report showed a significant increase in the deviation between maximum and minimum scores compared to 2017-18.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the PGI?

(a) Only three
(b) Only two
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe aspects of the PGI.  It assesses performance at state and district levels, uses UDISE+ and NAS data for a ten-grade classification, and in PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade. Statement 4 is incorrect because the PGI-D report considers various qualitative factors beyond just enrollment and infrastructure.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; the PGI 2.0 report actually showed a *reduction* in the deviation between maximum and minimum scores compared to 2017-18, indicating a decrease in the disparity among states/UTs.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  It establishes the NRF to provide strategic direction for research across various scientific and technological fields.
2.  The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.

4.  The NRF is primarily funded through private donations and corporate sponsorships.
5. The NRF's Governing Board includes members from the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Council.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. The NRF Act establishes the NRF for strategic research direction, it repeals and subsumes SERB, and the Governing Board includes members from the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Council. Statement 2 is partially correct; the Prime Minister is the ex-officio President, but it is not the only source of funding. Statement 4 is incorrect because while donations are a funding source, the Act primarily emphasizes government grants and loans as the main source of funding.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  It recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  It provides for free education for all children with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 years.
4.  It excludes police forces from the reservation mandate for PwDs.
5. It establishes special courts in every district for speedy adjudication of cases under the Act.

How many of these statements accurately reflect provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The Act mandates reservation in higher education and government jobs (excluding police forces), recognizes 21 disability types, and provides for special courts. However, statement 3 is slightly misleading. While the Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities, the phrasing "all children with disabilities" is too broad.  The Act specifies "benchmark disabilities," which refers to a certain level of severity.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  It is released jointly by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
2.  It ranks India among the countries with the "Serious" level of hunger.
3.  It shows a significant worsening of India's hunger situation compared to 2015.
4.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology and data sources.
5.  It categorizes South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the lowest hunger levels globally.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning the GHI 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4 are accurate. The GHI 2023 is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, ranks India as having a "Serious" hunger level, and the Indian government has voiced objections. Statement 3 is incorrect; the report shows a slight *improvement* in India's GHI score compared to 2015, although the overall level remains concerning. Statement 5 is incorrect because the report actually identifies South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):**

1.  It aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in all Indian villages.
2.  ODF Plus status requires sustained ODF status along with either solid or liquid waste management systems.
3.  ODF Plus Model villages must demonstrate visual cleanliness and display ODF Plus IEC messages.
4.  As of September 2023, over 75% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status under Phase-II.
5.  ODF status is solely defined by the absence of visible faeces in the environment.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) and ODF status?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The definition of ODF Plus includes waste management and visual cleanliness, ODF Plus Model villages have additional requirements, and over 75% of villages had achieved ODF Plus status by September 2023. Statement 1 is incorrect because the mission aims for ODF Plus, but not necessarily *all* villages achieving this status immediately. Statement 5 is incorrect because ODF status also includes the use of safe sanitation technologies in every household and public institution.


**8. Consider the following statements about the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA):**

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNFPA?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The UNFPA is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, aims for "three zeros" including ending preventable maternal deaths, collaborated with IIPS on the India Ageing Report, and publishes the "State of World Population" report. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the UNFPA headquarters are in New York City, not Geneva.

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  A cluster of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies can apply for DtBU status.
3.  DtBUs must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
4.  The NCERT was recently granted DtBU status, enabling it to offer its own doctoral degrees.
5. DtBUs require prior approval from the President of India to start new courses.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding DtBUs in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The 2023 regulations lowered the age requirement for DtBU applications, allow clusters of institutions to apply, mandate ABC identities, and the NCERT's DtBU status allows it to offer doctoral degrees. Statement 5 is incorrect; DtBUs need approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils, not the President of India, to introduce new courses.


**10. Consider the following about the National Medical Commission (NMC):**

1.  It is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  It received WFME recognition for 10 years, ensuring automatic accreditation for all existing and new medical colleges.
3.  It is the sole regulatory body overseeing medical education and practice in India.

5. The NMC is responsible for regulating dental education and the dental profession.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the NMC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The NMC is a statutory body under the 2019 Act, and it received WFME recognition impacting accreditation of medical colleges. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the NMC plays a major role, other agencies also contribute to regulating medical education and practice. Statement 4 is partially correct; the NMC Act aims for a national exit test, but its complete implementation might not be fully realized. Statement 5 is incorrect; the National Dental Commission (NDC) is responsible for dental education and practice, not the NMC.


**1. Consider the following statements about the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):**

1. It was established in 1971 as a major research center.
2. Its headquarters are located in Washington, D.C.
3. It works in over 60 countries, including India.
4. It primarily focuses on research related to climate change impacts.

**How many of the above statements are correct?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: IFPRI's headquarters are indeed in Washington, D.C.  Statement 3 is also correct; IFPRI operates in over 60 countries, including India. However, statement 1 is incorrect.  IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971. While IFPRI's research significantly addresses food security issues exacerbated by climate change, its focus is broader than solely climate change impacts.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):**

1. It was established by the UN General Assembly in 1960.
2. Its headquarters are in New York City.
3. It works primarily with high-income countries to address refugee issues.
4.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational to its work.


**How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNHCR?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1960 (Statement 1). Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City (Statement 2).  The UNHCR works extensively with low- and middle-income countries, which host the vast majority of refugees globally,  contradicting statement 3.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed core legal frameworks guiding UNHCR operations.


**3. Consider the following about the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):**

1. It was established in 1983.
2. Its headquarters are in London, England.
3. It is responsible for accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles.
4. It directly appoints members to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India.

**Which of the above statements are accurate?**

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GANHRI was founded in 1993, not 1983 (Statement 1). Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not London (Statement 2). Statement 3 is correct: GANHRI's key function is the accreditation of NHRIs according to the Paris Principles.  GANHRI does not appoint members to national human rights commissions; those appointments are made through national processes (Statement 4). Thus, only statement 3 is correct.


**4. Consider the following points regarding the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII):**

1. It was established in 1990.
2. It is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly.
3. Its membership includes experts nominated by governments and indigenous organizations.
4.  It primarily focuses on issues related to space exploration.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe the UNPFII?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNPFII was established in 2000, not 1990 (Statement 1). It's a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly (Statement 2). Statement 3 is accurate:  Its membership comprises experts nominated by both governments and indigenous organizations.  The UNPFII's mandate is focused on indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights, not space exploration (Statement 4). Therefore, three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements related to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1. The NIF solely uses global indicators for assessing progress.
2.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for its development.
3. The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
4. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is static and unchanging.

**How many of the above statements are correct?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NIF incorporates both global indicators and those specific to India. Statement 2 is correct: MoSPI leads the NIF's development. Statement 3 is also correct:  The framework includes India-specific indicators. Statement 4 is incorrect; the GIF, like the NIF, is dynamic and evolves over time.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5):**

1. It was conducted in 2018-2019.
2. It provides data on spousal abuse in India.
3. It is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
4.  It exclusively focuses on urban populations.

**Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of NFHS-5?**

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 was conducted in 2019-2021, not 2018-2019 (Statement 1). Statement 2 is correct: NFHS-5 includes data on spousal violence. The survey is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (Statement 3), and it covers both rural and urban populations (Statement 4).  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**7. Consider these features of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1. It aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in all villages.
2. The ODF Plus model includes solid and liquid waste management.
3.  It exclusively focuses on urban sanitation.
4.  It does not involve any community participation.

**How many of these statements accurately describe the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  A primary goal is achieving ODF status. Statement 2 is also correct; the ODF Plus model incorporates both solid and liquid waste management systems. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the mission focuses on rural sanitation, not exclusively urban.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; community participation is a crucial component of the mission's success.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements about the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1. It advocates for a 10+2+3 system of schooling.
2. It aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education.

4. It completely eliminates vocational education.

**How many of the above statements accurately reflect the NEP 2020?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 system, not 10+2+3 (Statement 1).  Statement 2 is correct:  It aims to significantly raise the GER. Statement 3 is also correct; it emphasizes multilingualism.  Statement 4 is incorrect; it reforms and integrates vocational education, not eliminating it. Thus, three statements are accurate.


**9. Consider these aspects of the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. It is exclusively for higher education.
2. It integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
3. It uses a fixed number of notional learning hours per year.
4.  It is managed solely by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

**How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NCrF encompasses school, higher, and vocational education. Statement 2 is correct: It aims to integrate credits across these educational pathways. Statement 3 is also correct: It establishes a standard number of notional learning hours. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF is a collaborative effort involving multiple bodies beyond the UGC.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1. It defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2. It provides only criminal remedies.
3. It covers women in both organized and unorganized sectors.

**How many of the above statements correctly describe the PWDVA, 2005?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse (Statement 1).  It provides civil remedies, not solely criminal ones (Statement 2). Statement 3 is correct: It covers women across various employment sectors.  The establishment of ICCs is mandated under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, not the PWDVA (Statement 4).  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**11. Consider the following statements about the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA):**

1. It was established in 1979.
2. Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNFPA was established in 1969, not 1979 (Statement 1).  Its headquarters are in New York City, not Geneva (Statement 2). Statement 3 is correct: It aims to achieve three zeros – ending unmet need for family planning, ending preventable maternal deaths, and ending gender-based violence and harmful practices. The UNFPA's focus is on sexual and reproductive health and rights, not industrial development (Statement 4).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**12. Consider these characteristics of the  Ayushman Bharat Yojana:**

1. It primarily focuses on tertiary healthcare.

The Ayushman Bharat Yojana addresses healthcare across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels (Statement 1). Statement 2 is correct: A key component is providing health insurance.  It involves both public and private sector participation (Statement 3). It addresses a broad range of health concerns, including both communicable and non-communicable diseases (Statement 4).  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**13. Consider the following aspects of the Anganwadi system:**

1. It is solely managed by the private sector.
2. It primarily targets children aged 0-3 years.
3. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium.

**How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anganwadi system?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Anganwadi system is a public program, not solely private (Statement 1). While it serves children 0-6 years, its focus extends beyond just the 0-3 age group (Statement 2).  AWWs do receive a fixed honorarium, often supplemented by performance-based incentives (Statement 3).  Statement 4 is correct: The Anganwadi system is a crucial component of the ICDS scheme.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**14.  Consider the following statements about the  World Food Programme (WFP):**

1. It is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
2. It received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2020.

**How many of these statements accurately describe the WFP?**

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WFP's headquarters are in Rome, Italy, not Geneva (Statement 1). Statement 2 is correct; it did receive the Nobel Peace Prize.  It operates in many low- and middle-income countries, not solely high-income ones (Statement 3).  It is a UN program, but partnered with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the World Bank (Statement 4). Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

1. It permits abortion only up to 12 weeks of pregnancy.
2. It allows abortion for reasons of foetal abnormalities.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: Abortion is permitted for foetal abnormalities. The Act applies to all women, regardless of marital status (Statement 3).  The Act has been amended multiple times, most recently in 2021 (Statement 4).  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971.  CGIAR was established in 1971, and IFPRI became a major research center within CGIAR. Statement 2 is incorrect; IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland. Statement 3 is correct. IFPRI's core mandate involves providing research-based policy solutions to address issues of poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Statement 4 is incorrect. While IFPRI works in many countries, the text specifies "over 60," not "more than 100." Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNHCR's 2022 report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report stated a 21% increase, not 15%. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the report indicated that 30% of forcibly displaced people were children, not 25%. Statement 3 is close but incorrect. The report stated that 76% of the world's refugees were hosted by low- and middle-income countries, not 70%. Statement 4 is incorrect. The report indicated a 2% increase in stateless individuals, not 5%.  Statement 5 is incorrect; UNHCR headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.  Therefore, only statements 3 (although slightly inaccurate) and the implicit fact that the report exists are correct, making the correct answer (b).

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports plays a significant role, it doesn't directly manage all National Sports Federations; they have a degree of autonomy. Statement 2 is correct. Sports are listed in the State List of the Indian Constitution. Statement 3 is incorrect. The IOA does have authority over State Olympic Associations. Statement 4 is correct. Non-Olympic sports federations, like the BCCI, do have direct affiliations with their international counterparts.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, resulting in (b) as the correct option.

The 1941 census did collect caste data but withheld its publication. Statement 3 is partially correct,  though there have been exceptions and attempts at broader caste data collection, but full caste enumeration has largely been avoided after independence. Statement 4 is incorrect. The 2011 SECC data, excluding caste data, was eventually published, not the complete caste data. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following regarding the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1. The NIF exclusively uses global SDG indicators.
2.  The NIF currently comprises over 300 indicators.
3.  The NIF was developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the NIF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

While healthcare is a component, PM JANMAN's scope is broader, encompassing housing, sanitation, education, and nutrition. Statement 3 is correct. The initiative involves interventions from 9 ministries, which is more than 10. Statement 4 is correct.  A key goal is to provide basic amenities to PVTG households.

Statement 2 is correct. AWWs receive a fixed monthly honorarium, and additional performance-linked incentives are offered for utilizing ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While improving the nutritional status of children is a key objective, the Saksham Anganwadi initiative also addresses other aspects like early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years and early stimulation for children aged 0-3 years.  It also extends its focus to adolescent girls in aspirational districts and the North Eastern Region.

Statement 4 is correct.  AWWs and AWHs are indeed covered under PMJJBY and PMSBY, along with the Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY).  This demonstrates the government's commitment to their well-being and social security.

Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets vaccination coverage for children and pregnant women.  While Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) is a significant health insurance scheme, its primary focus is financial risk protection rather than direct service delivery improvement across all levels like the other four initiatives. Therefore, only four of the listed initiatives directly aim to improve access and address health issues across various levels.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The provided text indicates South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest hunger levels.  While South Asia consistently features prominently, the precise ranking can fluctuate slightly.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI uses multiple indicators, including undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. It is not based on a single metric.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the text notes a slight improvement in India's GHI score from 2015 to 2023, it doesn't imply consistent improvement.  The overall trend and the interpretation of the data are subject to debate and further analysis.


**4. Consider the following concerning the Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in India:**

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  ODF Plus builds upon the ODF status by adding requirements for waste management systems.

    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The New Development Bank (NDB) was established by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa).  While the initial subscribed capital was indeed $50 billion, it wasn't equally contributed by the founding members; contributions varied based on the economic strength of each nation.  Furthermore, the NDB primarily focuses on financing infrastructure and sustainable development projects in emerging economies and developing countries, not developed nations. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The African Union (AU) was indeed established in 2001 as a successor to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Its headquarters are in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and its primary goals include promoting peace, security, and stability across the African continent. However, the AU does not have exactly 50 member states; the number fluctuates slightly depending on political changes and recognition of states. Therefore, statement (d) is not entirely accurate.


6. **With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**
    1. Created in 1949, it works on the principle of collective defence.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the Global Gender Gap Index?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the Global Gender Gap Index.  The index is indeed published annually by the World Economic Forum, focusing on four key dimensions of gender equality.  India's 2023 ranking is also correctly stated. However, statement 4 is misleading. While the index indirectly reflects the impact of women's participation in governance, it doesn't directly measure the percentage of women in local governance for each country; that's a separate data point often analyzed alongside the index's findings.  The index provides a broader assessment of gender parity across various societal aspects. Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following concerning the Gender Social Norms Index:**

1. It is released by the World Bank.
2. It assesses societal norms related to gender equality across four dimensions.
3. The four dimensions include political, educational, economic, and physical integrity aspects.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the Gender Social Norms Index?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Social Norms Index is indeed a tool for understanding the systematic disadvantages faced by women and girls (statement 4 is correct).  It assesses gender equality across four dimensions (statement 2 is correct), which include political, educational, economic, and physical integrity (statement 3 is correct). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the index.


**3. Consider the following regarding the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI):**

1. It is jointly published by the WHO and the International Monetary Fund.
2. It tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes four indicator categories.
3. The four categories include reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access.
4. India's score in 2021 was lower than its score in 2019.

How many of these statements are accurate representations of the UHC SCI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The UHC SCI does track SDG 3.8.1 and encompasses the four specified indicator categories. India's score did decline from 2019 to 2021.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the index is a joint publication of the WHO and the World Bank, not the IMF.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the "Path to Equal" report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct descriptions of the "Path to Equal" report. The report does introduce the WEI and GGPI, with the WEI focusing solely on women and the GGPI comparing women's status to men's.  However, statement 1 is incorrect;  the report is a joint effort of UN Women and UNDP, not UNICEF and the World Bank.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



**5. Consider the following about the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT):**

1. It was established in 1961 under Article 344(1) of the Indian Constitution.
2. It aims to develop technical terminology in all Indian languages.
3. It is currently working on technical terminology in ten Indian languages, including Bodo, Santhali, and Sanskrit.
4. It operates under the Ministry of External Affairs.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the CSTT's characteristics?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The CSTT's objective is indeed to develop technical terminology in Indian languages, and it's currently working on ten languages, including those mentioned. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the CSTT was established under Article 344(4), not 344(1). Statement 4 is also incorrect;  the CSTT doesn't operate under the Ministry of External Affairs, its association is with the Ministry of Education.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs:**

1. It was developed by the NITI Aayog.
2. It aligns with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) but also includes India-specific indicators.
3.  The NIF, 2023, comprises fewer than 200 indicators.
4. It guides the development of State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs) across Indian states and union territories.


Which of the statements above are accurate descriptions of the NIF for SDGs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 correctly describe the NIF. The framework does align with the GIF while including India-specific indicators, and it guides the development of SIFs. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NIF was developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), not NITI Aayog. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NIF, 2023, actually includes more than 284 indicators. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.



**7. Consider the following aspects of the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1. It assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  It utilizes data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS).
3. It categorizes states/UTs and districts into ten grades, with "Daksh" being the highest.
4. In PGI 2.0 (2021-22), no state/UT achieved the highest grade.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of the PGI?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately depict the PGI. The index assesses performance at both state and district levels, uses a ten-grade system with "Daksh" as the highest, and in the 2021-22 assessment, no state/UT achieved the highest grade. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The PGI utilizes data from both the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the NAS, not solely from the NAS. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's impact on higher education:**

1. It aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% by 2035.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the NEP 2020's goals for higher education?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect the NEP 2020's objectives for higher education.  The policy does aim for a 50% GER by 2035, promotes multiple exit points (not a single exit point as stated incorrectly in option 2) for undergraduate degrees, encourages the establishment of MERUs, and establishes the NETF to leverage technology in education. Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about the "Global 2000" report:**

1. It's released by the Times Higher Education.
2. It ranks universities based on four factors: quality of education, employability, quality of faculty, and research performance.
3.  It includes a significant number of Indian universities in its rankings.
4. It gives equal weightage to all four ranking parameters.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the "Global 2000" report?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the "Global 2000" report. The report does indeed use those four factors in its ranking methodology and includes a considerable number of Indian universities. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report is published by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR), not Times Higher Education. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the report uses all four parameters, it doesn't give them equal weightage; research performance receives a higher weightage (40%) compared to the others (25% each for quality of education and employability, and 10% for quality of faculty).  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India:**

3. DtBUs are mandated to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
4.  The NCERT's recent DtBU status allows it to offer only undergraduate degrees.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the current regulations and status of DtBUs in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the current regulations and status of DtBUs.  The 2023 regulations do allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply, permit clusters of institutions under multiple sponsors to apply, and mandate the creation of ABC identities for students. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NCERT's DtBU status allows it to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees, not just undergraduate degrees. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


**11. Consider the following concerning the UGC regulations on setting up campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India:**

1. FHEIs require UGC approval before establishing Indian campuses.
2. FHEIs ranked within the top 1000 globally are eligible to set up campuses in India.
3. FHEIs can offer online or distance learning programs in India.
4. FHEIs must comply with Indian laws, including those related to foreign exchange and foreign contributions.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the UGC regulations on FHEIs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the UGC regulations. FHEIs do need UGC approval for establishing campuses and offering programs, and the eligibility criteria include being ranked within the top 500 (not top 1000 as stated incorrectly in option 2) globally.  Compliance with Indian laws is also mandatory. However, statement 3 is incorrect; FHEIs are prohibited from offering online or distance learning programs initially in India. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**12. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. It's developed by a committee solely comprising members from the UGC.
2. It integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
3.  It uses a credit system dividing education into 6 levels.
4. It aims to enhance flexibility and mobility in education.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the NCrF. The framework does integrate credits from different educational streams, and it aims to enhance flexibility and mobility. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NCrF was developed by a high-level committee with members from various organizations, not solely the UGC. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 6.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**13. Consider the following related to the Bihar caste survey:**

1. The survey was conducted under the Census Act of 1948.
2. The survey focused solely on caste demographics.
3.  It was conducted by the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Bihar caste survey?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Bihar caste survey primarily focused on caste demographics, and the last full-scale caste-based enumeration was indeed conducted in 1931. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the survey was not conducted under the Census Act of 1948, it was a state-level initiative.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the survey was conducted by the Bihar state government, not the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.

4. The report was released in 2023.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNHCR report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect the UNHCR report's findings. The report did indicate over 108.4 million forcibly displaced people, a significant increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises, and that low- and middle-income countries host a majority of refugees.  The report was also released in 2023, after the events of 2022. Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**15. Consider the following regarding the GANHRI's decision on the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation in 2023.
2.  The deferral was due to concerns about political interference in NHRC appointments.

How many of the above statements accurately describe GANHRI's actions concerning the NHRC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe GANHRI's actions.  The accreditation was indeed deferred, concerns about political interference were cited, and the process is based on the Paris Principles. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the NHRC's accreditation was deferred previously as well (in 2016). Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.

4.  It is the sole UN body mandated to deal specifically with indigenous peoples' issues.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNPFII?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the UNPFII. It does have 16 experts serving three-year terms, and its mandate encompasses the areas listed. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the UNPFII is a subsidiary body of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the UNPFII is one of three UN bodies dealing with indigenous peoples' issues, not the sole body. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**17. Consider the following regarding the UNFPA's "India Ageing Report 2023":**

1. It was released in collaboration with the National Sample Survey Office (NSSO).
2. It projects India as the world's most populous country by mid-2023.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The report does project India's population surpassing China, notes its young population, and provides data on fertility and life expectancy.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report was released in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), not the NSSO. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the report. The report did highlight the pandemic's impact and projected a significant number of children out of school. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report actually indicated weak progress on many SDG targets. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the report was released by UNDESA, not the UNFPA. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

1. It was released in collaboration with the FAO.
2. It focuses on rethinking food crisis responses.
3. It highlights the rising number of undernourished people due to multiple crises.
4. It projects a decrease in food insecurity by 2050.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the IFPRI report?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the report. The report does focus on rethinking responses and highlights the rise in undernourishment due to various crises.  However, statement 1 is incorrect;  the report was released by IFPRI alone. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it projects an *increase*, not a decrease, in undernourished people by 2050 due to climate change. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

The question uses the detail about local governance representation to test precise knowledge of the index's scope and methodology.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the provided information.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the largest absolute number of STs.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTGs.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
4.  Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements except statement 4 are correct.  Statement 1 is true; Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of Scheduled Tribes. Statement 2 accurately identifies the Ministry of Tribal Affairs as the nodal ministry. Statement 3 correctly reflects two of the criteria used to identify PVTGs (pre-agricultural technology and declining or stagnant population). Statement 5 is also correct; the government renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006. However, Statement 4 is incorrect. While Odisha has a significant number of PVTGs, it is not the state with the highest number. The text states Odisha houses 13 PVTGs,  but does not claim this to be the highest number in India.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled DNTs as "born criminals."

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 wrongly labeled DNTs as "born criminals," which is a significant historical fact. The Renke Commission's estimate of 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic communities is mentioned in the text. The Hakki Pikki Tribe is cited as an example of a semi-nomadic group.  August 31st is indeed celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The text explicitly states that while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, the reverse is not true.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The Act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks.  It also mandates special courts in every district for quicker case resolution.  The definition of "person with benchmark disability" as having at least 40% of a specified disability is accurate.  However, statement 1 is slightly misleading; while the act mandates reservation, it does not specify the exact percentage of 5% for higher education institutions; the text mentions "not less than 5%". Statement 4 is incorrect; the text explicitly excludes police forces from the reservation policy.

4.  Safal karamcharis are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under the act.
5.  The act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are correct. PEMSR defines manual scavengers as those handling human waste from insanitary latrines, etc.,  without proper protection.  Constructing insanitary latrines is indeed an offense under the act. The act does provide for rehabilitation measures. However, statement 3 is inaccurate; the act doesn't mandate the immediate demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe; it just says that they must be demolished or converted. Statement 4 is incorrect; the text includes Safal karamcharis in the definition of manual scavengers.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 accurately describe the NCrF. It integrates credits across different educational pathways, employs an eight-level system, enables multiple entry and exit points, and utilizes the concept of notional learning hours.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs and at least 5% in higher educational institutions for PwDs. The Act indeed recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks.  Free education is guaranteed for children with benchmark disabilities (40% or more disability) between 6 and 18 years of age. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act specifically excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and UT police) from the reservation provision.  Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Act's provisions.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits manual scavenging.  It broadly defines manual scavengers, including those working with insanitary latrines, even if they use protective gear (though use of protective gear is an exception). The Act criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs. Therefore, only three statements are correct, leading to (c) as the correct answer.  This question assesses knowledge of the PEMSR Act and related government schemes.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCF-SE does indeed propose a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling. Statement 3 is also correct; multilingualism is a key feature, emphasizing at least three languages with a preference for Indian languages.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NCF-SE allows students to take board examinations twice a year, retaining the better score.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the framework aims to integrate academic and vocational subjects, offering flexibility at the secondary level, not strictly separating them. Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.  The question assesses understanding of the NCF-SE's key features and its departure from previous frameworks.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The NCrF aims to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways, and it employs an 8-level credit system covering school and higher education, as well as vocational training. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning as a way to earn credits.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the framework actively seeks to enhance flexibility and mobility within the education system by allowing for credit transfers.  Therefore, two statements are incorrect, making (b) the correct option. The question tests knowledge of the NCrF's structure and objectives.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The NRF Act establishes the Anusandhan NRF for strategic research direction. The Prime Minister is the ex-officio President of the Governing Board.  The Act did repeal the SERB Act, subsuming SERB into the NRF. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The NRF's funding comes from multiple sources including central government grants, donations, investment income, and funds from the previous SERB. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, resulting in (a) as the correct answer. The question assesses understanding of the NRF's structure, funding, and legal basis.


**9. Consider the following statements related to the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by the World Bank.
2.  The 2023 GHI report ranked India among the countries with the highest hunger levels.
3.  The GHI considers indicators like undernourishment and child mortality.
4.  The Indian government has not raised any objections regarding the GHI methodology.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct; the 2023 GHI report placed India in a category indicating serious levels of hunger. Statement 3 is also correct; the GHI uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Indian government has indeed raised objections to the GHI's methodology and data sources. Therefore, three statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct answer. The question tests knowledge about the GHI and the Indian government's response to it.


**10. Consider the following about the  UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023:**

1.  The report projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2023.
2.  The report indicates India has a high proportion of its population in the older age groups (65+).
3.  The report highlights a significant decline in India's total fertility rate.
4.  The report focuses solely on India's demographic trends.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The report did project India to surpass China in population by mid-2023.  It also shows a decline in India's total fertility rate.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the report provides data on India's aging population, it does not indicate a *high* proportion in the 65+ age group compared to other countries (currently around 7%). Statement 4 is also incorrect; the report is a global report, not solely focused on India.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, leading to (a) as the correct answer. The question tests detailed knowledge of the report's findings.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the largest absolute number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for PVTGs.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
4. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) overall, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 2 is correct; the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for PVTG welfare. Statement 3 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs.  Statement 4 is correct; Odisha has the highest number of recognized PVTGs. Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The inclusion of seemingly correct but ultimately false information about Madhya Pradesh's PVTG numbers serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of PVTG distribution across states.


**2. Consider the following regarding the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, later repealed, categorized DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic tribes.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the historical context of the DNT categorization under the repealed Criminal Tribes Act. Statement 3 accurately cites the Renke Commission's estimate of the combined population of DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic groups. Statement 4 correctly states the date observed as Vimukta Jatis Day.  The incorrect inclusion of Statement 1, a factual inaccuracy concerning the relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs, acts as a key distractor for candidates who may have a general understanding of DNTs but lack precise knowledge of their classification.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act mandates at least 4% reservation for PwDs in government jobs, excluding police forces.
3.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.
4. The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between 6 and 18 years of age.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect provisions of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016.  The act details specific reservation percentages for PwDs in higher education and government employment (excluding certain specified categories like police forces). The act's recognition of 21 types of disabilities and provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities are also correctly stated. The question's design is challenging because it presents accurate information on a complex topic, requiring the candidate to have a detailed understanding of the act's provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of employment type.
2.  The Act makes it an offence to employ manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines but not sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
3.  The Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines.
4.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment and financial assistance.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Act's definition of manual scavengers.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect; the Act makes it an offense to employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear, as well as to employ manual scavengers for insanitary latrines.  Statement 3 correctly states the Act's mandate regarding community sanitary latrines.  Statement 4 is also correct, outlining the Act's rehabilitation provisions. Thus, three statements are correct. The partial inaccuracy in Statement 2, a subtle difference in the Act's scope, is designed to challenge candidates' precise understanding of the legislation's details.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to the eradication of child labour in India:**

1.  Ratification of ILO Convention 182 on the Worst Forms of Child Labour and Convention 138 on the Minimum Age of Employment.
2.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all employment.
3.  The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme includes opening special schools and rehabilitation centers for child labourers.
4.  The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) Portal is used for rescuing and rehabilitating child labour victims.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe initiatives taken to combat child labour in India.  The ratification of key ILO conventions, the 2016 amendment act prohibiting child labour below 14, the NCLP scheme for rehabilitation, and the PENCiL portal for rescue and rehabilitation are all factual and relevant to the topic.  The question's difficulty stems from the need to recall multiple specific details related to different anti-child labour programs in India, demanding a broad understanding of the issue.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.
2.  The Act categorizes offences committed by juveniles as heinous, serious, or petty.
3.  The 2021 amendment to the Act redefines 'serious offences' based on Supreme Court recommendations in the *Shilpa Mittal v. State of NCT of Delhi* case.
4. The Act allows for a child aged 16-18 to be tried as an adult in cases of heinous offenses.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct representations of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and its subsequent amendments. The act's definition of a child, its categorization of offenses, the 2021 amendment based on Supreme Court rulings, and the provision for trying 16-18 year olds as adults in heinous cases are all accurate. The question's difficulty lies in the need to recall specific details regarding the legal definitions and amendments within the Juvenile Justice Act, requiring a precise understanding of the legislation.


**7. Consider the following concerning the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and performance-linked incentives.
4.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used for monitoring nutrition service delivery.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe aspects of the Anganwadi system in India.  The system's integration into the ICDS scheme, the objectives of the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, the compensation structure for AWWs and AWHs, and the use of the Poshan Tracker app are all accurate. The question's difficulty stems from the need for detailed knowledge about the Anganwadi system's structure, funding, and operational mechanisms, demanding precise understanding of various government schemes related to early childhood care.


**8. Consider the following about the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan:**

1.  Launched in 2017, it aims to reduce stunting in districts with the highest malnutrition burden.
2.  It focuses solely on improving the utilization of Anganwadi services.
3.  It monitors, supervises, and guides nutrition-related interventions across various ministries.
4.  It aims to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly states the launch year and one of the key objectives of the POSHAN Abhiyan. Statement 2 is incorrect, as POSHAN Abhiyan's scope extends beyond Anganwadi services to encompass broader nutrition-related interventions. Statement 3 accurately describes the mission's role in monitoring and guiding nutrition initiatives across different ministries. Statement 4 correctly outlines the overall goal of holistic development and nutrition for target groups.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The deliberate inclusion of a partially true but ultimately inaccurate statement (2) challenges the candidate's ability to discern the precise scope and objectives of the POSHAN Abhiyan.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  The GHI is released annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.
2.  The GHI 2023 ranked India 111th among 125 countries.
3.  The GHI uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
4. The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology.


Which of the following statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect facts about the Global Hunger Index (GHI). The organizations responsible for its release, India's ranking in the 2023 report, the indicators used in the index, and the Indian government's objections to its methodology are all correct. The question's difficulty lies in requiring the candidate to possess detailed knowledge of the GHI, including its methodology and the controversies surrounding its application to India.  This necessitates a nuanced understanding of international development indicators and their limitations.


**10. Consider the following about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It recommends board examinations for Grades 10 and 12, with students allowed to take them twice in a year.
3.  It emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
4. It advocates for the integration of vocational education across different stages of schooling.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect key features of the NCF-SE. The proposed 5+3+3+4 schooling structure, the recommendations regarding board examinations, the multilingual emphasis, and the integration of vocational education are all correctly stated. The question's difficulty lies in its comprehensive nature, demanding a detailed knowledge of the NCF-SE's various provisions and its overall approach to school education reform.  Candidates must possess a thorough understanding of the policy document to answer correctly.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements related to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules explicitly permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women, whether widows or divorcees, are permitted to undergo surrogacy using donor sperm and their own eggs.
3.  The rules maintain the 2022 prohibition on the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.
4. The rules explicitly permit commercial surrogacy for couples facing infertility issues.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions within the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect aspects of the amended rules. The 2024 amendments relaxed the previous restrictions on donor gametes (Statement 1) and allowed single women to use donor sperm (Statement 2). Statement 3 is incorrect because the 2022 prohibition was lifted in specific circumstances. Statement 4 is incorrect as the rules explicitly prohibit commercial surrogacy, upholding the altruistic surrogacy model.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of legal nuances.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021:**

1.  Termination of pregnancy is permissible up to 24 weeks for all women, based on the advice of one doctor.
2.  The Act, as amended, allows for termination beyond 20 weeks in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities, even in cases where the mother is not facing an immediate life-threatening condition.
3.  The amended Act explicitly addresses situations beyond 24 weeks only under specific circumstances, such as rape or incest, and requires the advice of a medical board.
4.  The Act does not permit the termination of pregnancy based solely on the gender of the foetus.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the amended MTP Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 and 4 accurately reflect the law.  The 2021 amendment expanded the permissible timeframe for abortion and included circumstances beyond the mother's immediate health. The Act explicitly forbids sex-selective abortions (Statement 4). Statement 1 is incorrect; the limit is 20 weeks, not 24. Statement 3 is partially correct in that it addresses situations beyond 20 weeks; however, it doesn't exclusively limit those to rape or incest; other serious medical conditions are also considered. This question tests detailed knowledge of the amended Act and the ability to differentiate between nuanced legal provisions.



**3. Consider the following statements concerning the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme:**

1.  The NCLP is a State-level scheme primarily managed and funded by individual state governments.
2.  The scheme focuses solely on providing vocational training to children rescued from exploitative labor.
3.  The NCLP scheme includes establishing special schools and rehabilitation centers for child laborers.
4.  The scheme aims to prevent child labor but doesn’t provide any direct support for the rehabilitation and education of child laborers.

Which of the above statements correctly describes aspects of the NCLP Scheme?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Only statement 3 is accurate. The NCLP is a central sector scheme (not state-level, making 1 incorrect) that involves establishing special schools and rehabilitation centers to help child laborers.  The scheme focuses on both prevention and rehabilitation (making 4 incorrect).  Statement 2 is incorrect because the scheme's focus is broader than vocational training alone; it includes education and general rehabilitation. This question tests knowledge of government schemes and their specific components.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1.  The Act defines a 'child' as someone under 16 years of age.
2.  The Act allows for children aged 16-18 involved in heinous offenses to be tried as adults.
3.  The Act mandates that all children involved in any criminal offense must be tried as juveniles.
4.  The Act established the Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) as the primary body for child adoption processes.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Act allows for the consideration of adult trials for 16-18-year-olds in heinous crimes, and CARA is indeed involved in adoption (though not solely responsible for all aspects). Statement 1 is incorrect; the age limit is 18. Statement 3 is incorrect as the Act makes provisions for considering the age and nature of the crime before deciding how a case will be tried. This question tests knowledge of the Act and its age-related provisions.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  The NEP mandates a 10+2 structure for school education.
2.  The NEP aims to increase the Gross Enrollment Ratio (GER) in higher education to at least 50% by 2035.

How many of these statements correctly reflect the aims or features of the NEP 2020?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are accurate reflections of the NEP 2020.  The policy aims for a significant increase in higher education enrollment and the establishment of an NRF.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it advocates for a 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 3 is incorrect as the NEP promotes flexibility and integration between academic and vocational paths. This question tests the examinee's understanding of the NEP's core tenets.


**6. Consider the following organizations mentioned in the context of social issues:**

1.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
2.  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  The World Food Programme (WFP)

Statement 4 is incorrect; while paid menstrual leave is a topic of discussion globally, this policy doesn't mandate it in India.  This question tests knowledge of recent policy initiatives and their specific objectives.


**8. Consider the following related to the  Global Gender Gap Index:**

1. It is released annually by the World Economic Forum.
2. It measures gender parity across four key parameters: economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NIF for SDGs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. The NIF does incorporate global SDG indicators, adapting them to India's context. Statement 2 is incorrect, as the framework is dynamic and updated.

This question tests knowledge of national-level frameworks and their relationship to global initiatives.


**10. Consider the following related to  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):**

1.  ODF Plus status requires sustained ODF status and implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems.
2.  ODF Plus Model villages maintain ODF status, have systems for both solid and liquid waste management, and demonstrate visual cleanliness.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the criteria for ODF Plus status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and require precise factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1. Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of PVTGs in India.
2. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.
3. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology and a declining population.
4.  The term PVTG replaced Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 2006.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.  Statement 2 is correct. Statement 3 accurately reflects some of the criteria used to identify PVTGs. Statement 4 is correct; the renaming occurred in 2006.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The question uses close but incorrect data (Madhya Pradesh having the highest *overall* ST population, not PVTGs) to create a plausible distractor.



**2. Consider the following regarding Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated approximately 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic groups.
4.  The Hakki Pikki Tribe of Karnataka is an example of a nomadic group.


Which of the above statements is/are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct, reflecting the historical context of the DNT classification. Statement 3 correctly cites the Renke Commission's estimate.  Statement 4 is slightly misleading; the Hakki Pikki are *semi*-nomadic, not strictly nomadic. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.  The inclusion of a closely related but not perfectly accurate statement (Hakki Pikki being semi-nomadic) increases the difficulty.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to tribal welfare:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry.
2.  The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.
3. The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNTs.
4. The SEED scheme provides health insurance and competitive exam coaching for DNTs.


How many of the above statements correctly describe government initiatives for tribal welfare?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate descriptions of government initiatives.  The question's difficulty comes from requiring knowledge of specific scheme names and their focuses.  There are no obviously wrong or unrelated statements to easily eliminate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statement 1 is partially incorrect; it's 4%, not 5%, reservation in government jobs.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct, stating the number of recognized disabilities, the exclusion of police forces from reservation, and the ministry responsible for the Chief Commissioner's office respectively. The slight inaccuracy in statement 1 makes the question more challenging.



**5. Consider the following statements about Manual Scavenging:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, bans manual scavenging.
2.  The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of ₹1 lakh for violations.
3. Safal Karamcharis are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers in the Act.
4. The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the legal and policy framework concerning manual scavenging in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Statement 3 is incorrect; Safal Karamcharis, while often involved in sanitation work, are *not* explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers if they are performing the work without proper protective gear.  The subtle inaccuracy in statement 3 makes this a difficult question.



**6. Consider the following about the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1. The PGI assesses performance at the state and district levels.

Which of the above statements about the PGI are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the PGI and its methodology. The question's difficulty lies in the requirement to recall specific details about the PGI's data sources and grading outcomes.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Each organization listed (UNFPA, UNDESA, UNCRC, UNHCR) has released reports on the topics mentioned in the question. The difficulty lies in associating each organization with its specific area of focus.


**9. Consider the following Acts related to social justice:**

1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021
2. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult', employing plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It aims to integrate credits from school, higher, and vocational education, facilitating student mobility.
2.  It mandates a uniform 1200 Notional Learning Hours per year across all educational levels.
3.  It introduces a new 8-level credit system, with levels 1-4 exclusively for higher education.
4.  It allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning and industry experience.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key features of the NCrF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NCrF explicitly seeks to integrate credits earned across different educational pathways to enhance flexibility and mobility.  Statement 2 is also correct; the framework does establish a standard of 1200 Notional Learning Hours per year. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The 8-level credit system encompasses school education (levels 1-4), higher education (levels 4.5-8), and vocational education (levels 1-8), not exclusively higher education. Statement 4 is accurate; the NCrF allows for credit accumulation through various methods including experiential learning and industry-acquired proficiencies.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India:**

1.  The UGC accords recognition to HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956.
2.  The NEP 2020 advocates for a single, unified accreditation body for all educational levels.
3.  The Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited).
4.  NABET, a constituent board of QCI, offers an accreditation program for school governance.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of HEI accreditation in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate: The UGC plays a crucial role in recognizing HEIs. Statement 2 is incorrect;  while NEP 2020 envisions an improved system, it doesn't propose a single body for all educational levels.  Statement 3 is correct: The Radhakrishnan Committee’s recommendations include a transition to a binary accreditation system. Statement 4 is also correct: NABET does offer an accreditation program focusing on school governance,  demonstrating the existence of multiple agencies involved in different levels of educational assessment.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following about the National Medical Commission (NMC) and related Acts:**

1.  The NMC Act, 2019 established the NMC as a statutory body.
2.  The NNMC Act, 2023 repealed the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947.
3.  The NDC Act, 2023 introduces a national exit test for dentists, similar to the NEET.
4.  The WFME recognition granted to the NMC ensures accreditation for all existing and new medical colleges for the next 20 years.

How many of the above statements are factually correct regarding the NMC and recent related legislation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NMC was indeed established under the 2019 Act. Statement 2 is also correct; the NNMC Act, 2023, did repeal the 1947 Act. Statement 3 is accurate: The NDC Act does introduce a national exit test for dentists.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the WFME recognition benefits the NMC,  the duration of automatic accreditation for new colleges is 10 years, not 20.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3.  It integrates contributions to knowledge by Indians from ancient to modern times into the curriculum.
4.  It introduces a completely new system of board exams replacing the existing system.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The NCF-SE does propose a revised 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 2 is incorrect; while multilingualism is emphasized, it doesn't mandate a foreign language. Statement 3 is correct: The framework does integrate Indian contributions to knowledge across time periods. Statement 4 is incorrect; it proposes changes to board exams but doesn’t replace the existing system entirely. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

How many of the statements above accurately describe the NRF Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Prime Minister heads the Governing Board. Statement 2 is also correct: The SERB is subsumed under the NRF.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the NRF receives donations, its primary funding comes from the central government and other sources mentioned in the act, not solely private donations and international grants. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the administrative department is the Department of Science and Technology (DST).  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  It defines domestic violence to include physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.
2.  It allows for complaints only from legally married women.
3.  It provides for shelter homes and medical aid for victims.
4.  It exclusively provides civil remedies, not criminal ones, for domestic violence.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PWDVA, 2005?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The PWDVA broadly defines domestic violence. Statement 2 is incorrect; it covers a wider range of women in domestic relationships. Statement 3 is correct: The act does provide for support services. Statement 4 is partially correct in that it primarily deals with civil remedies, but criminal charges can still be pursued under other relevant laws.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.  The PWDVA works in conjunction with other legal frameworks.


**7. Consider the following regarding initiatives to address manual scavenging in India:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines.

How many of the above statements accurately describe initiatives related to manual scavenging?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The 2013 Act does aim to eliminate insanitary latrines. Statement 2 is incorrect; NAMASTE has a broader scope than just garbage lifting. Statement 3 is correct: The Yojana does offer such loans.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the definition is broader, encompassing various employment situations. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the  Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its amendments:**

1. The Act permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.
2.  The 2024 amendments allow surrogacy using donor gametes under specific conditions.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its amendments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act only permits altruistic surrogacy. Statement 2 is correct: The amendments introduced changes to the regulations regarding donor gametes. Statement 3 is correct: The NARTSB is established under the Act. Statement 4 is incorrect; the insurance period is 36 months, not 24. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following concerning the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):**

1. The UNCRC is a legally binding international treaty ratified by all UN member states.
2.  The UNCRC has issued guidance on children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.
3.  The UNCRC primarily focuses on the rights of children in conflict zones.
4. The UNCRC is monitored by a committee of 12 independent experts.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the UNCRC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while it is a legally binding treaty, not all UN member states have ratified it. Statement 2 is correct: The UNCRC has indeed issued such guidance. Statement 3 is incorrect; its scope is broader than just conflict zones. Statement 4 is incorrect; it's monitored by a committee of 18 experts.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

1. The GHI is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  The GHI measures only undernourishment and child mortality rates.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved over the past decade.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GHI is not released by the WFP, although the WFP is involved in related work. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GHI considers a broader range of indicators. Statement 3 is an opinion and depends on the specific years considered; it may not always be true. Statement 4 is correct: The GHI does indeed use multiple indicators related to nutrition and child health. Therefore, only one statement is accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in all organizations with 5 or more employees.
2.  The ICC's powers are similar to those of a civil court, enabling it to conduct inquiries and recommend actions.
3.  A complaint under the POSH Act must be filed within six months of the incident, with no possibility of extension.
4. The Act covers only women employed in the organized sector.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The POSH Act, 2013, indeed grants the Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) powers similar to those of a civil court to investigate complaints of sexual harassment and recommend appropriate actions.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 5.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the Act allows the ICC to extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond the initial three months.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the POSH Act's scope extends to both organized and unorganized sectors and includes a wide range of women, not just those formally employed.  The Act's broad coverage aims to create a safer and more equitable workplace for all women, regardless of their employment status or sector.


**2. Consider the following features related to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person below the age of 16.
2.  The Act categorically states that children between 16 and 18 years of age can never be tried as adults.
3.  The Act introduced a provision allowing for the adoption of a child only after a final order is issued by a High Court.
4.  The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to handle cases involving children in conflict with the law.

Which of the above statements is/are not correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age (not 16).  The Act does *not* categorically prohibit trying 16-18-year-olds as adults; it allows for such a possibility in cases of heinous offenses, subject to assessment by a Juvenile Justice Board.  Finally, the Act specifies that adoption orders can be issued by District Magistrates, not solely by High Courts. Only statement 4 is correct; Juvenile Justice Boards are indeed established under the Act to handle cases involving children in conflict with the law.  The Act's provisions reflect a complex balancing act between protecting children's rights and addressing the need for accountability in cases of serious offenses.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021:**

1.  The Act permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, does establish a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to monitor and regulate surrogacy practices in India.  The Act also maintains a ban on surrogacy for foreign nationals.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act only permits altruistic surrogacy, explicitly prohibiting commercial surrogacy. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Act, in its original form, does not explicitly allow surrogacy for single women or same-sex couples, although there have been subsequent amendments and court cases addressing related issues. The Act’s regulations reflect a cautious approach to surrogacy, balancing ethical considerations with the needs of intending parents.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1. The Act defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2. The Act provides only criminal remedies for domestic violence.
3. The Act covers only women legally married to their abusers.
4. The Act establishes a mechanism for providing shelter and medical aid to victims.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The PWDVA, 2005, does provide for shelter homes and medical facilities to assist victims of domestic violence.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect because the Act provides primarily civil remedies, not criminal ones, although criminal charges may be pursued separately. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Act's protection extends beyond legally married women to include those in various domestic relationships, including live-in partners. The Act's comprehensive approach aims to address the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and provide support to those affected.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019:**

1. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in employment but not in education.
2. The Act mandates the issuance of a certificate of identity by the district magistrate based on self-perceived gender identity.
3.  The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the government on related matters.
4. The Act explicitly allows transgender individuals to adopt children without any restrictions.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Act does mandate the issuance of a certificate of identity based on self-perceived gender identity, and it does establish a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the government. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act prohibits discrimination in both employment and education. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the Act addresses various rights of transgender persons, it does not explicitly address adoption rights without any restrictions. The Act represents a significant step towards recognizing and protecting the rights of transgender individuals in India, but further legislative and social changes are needed to address all aspects of their well-being.

How many of the above are correct provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four of the five statements accurately reflect provisions within the RPwD Act, 2016. The Act does indeed mandate reservations for PwDs in higher education (at least 5%) and government jobs (at least 4%, excluding police forces) (statements 1 and 2).  It also recognizes a broad range of 21 disabilities (statement 3) and guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities within the specified age group (statement 4). However, while the Act emphasizes speedy resolution of cases, it doesn't explicitly mandate a special court in *every* district (statement 5).  Therefore, only four statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  It completely bans the practice of manual scavenging.
2.  It prescribes penalties including imprisonment up to two years and/or a fine of up to ₹1 lakh.
3.  It defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle human waste from insanitary latrines without protective gear.
4.  It mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines.
5.  It outlines a rehabilitation process for manual scavengers, including alternative employment training and financial assistance.

How many of the above accurately describe the provisions of the PEMSR Act?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements correctly reflect key aspects of the PEMSR Act. The Act aims to completely eradicate manual scavenging (statement 1) and enforces this through substantial penalties (statement 2). It provides a clear definition of manual scavenging, focusing on the handling of human waste without proper safety measures (statement 3).  The Act also places a responsibility on local authorities to provide and maintain sanitary latrines (statement 4) and includes a comprehensive framework for the rehabilitation and reintegration of manual scavengers (statement 5). Therefore, all five statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. It emphasizes capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.
2. It introduces interdisciplinary areas of study as a separate subject at the secondary stage.

4. It advocates for the integration of vocational skills training into the school curriculum.


Which of the statements above are in line with the goals of NCF-SE?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the NCF-SE's focus.  The framework prioritizes developing capacities for scientific inquiry alongside theoretical knowledge (statement 1). It also promotes interdisciplinary learning as a separate subject at the secondary level (statement 2), and integrates environmental education throughout the curriculum, culminating in a dedicated area of study at the secondary stage (statement 3). While the NCF-SE promotes skill development, it doesn't necessarily advocate for the *integration* of vocational skills training as a core part of the curriculum in the same way as the other three mentioned (statement 4). Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 align directly with the NCF-SE's goals.


**6. Consider the following regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  A cluster of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies can apply for DtBU status.
3.  DtBUs can start new courses without any prior approval from any authority.
4.  DtBUs are mandated to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.


Which of the above statements correctly reflect the current regulations for DtBUs?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately represent the updated regulations for DtBUs. The 2023 regulations reduced the minimum age requirement for applying for DtBU status to less than 20 years (statement 1), and they allow clusters of institutions under multiple sponsors to apply (statement 2).  DtBUs are also required to utilize the ABC system for student credit management (statement 4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; DtBUs need prior approvals (from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils) to introduce new courses or programs. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**7. Consider the following about the  National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. It is a unified framework integrating credits from school, higher education, and vocational/skill education.
2. It encompasses the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF qualification frameworks.
3. It allows for multiple entry and exit options in the education system.
4.  It mandates a fixed number of notional learning hours per year for all educational levels.
5. It aims to enhance employability skills through vocational training.

How many of the above are core features of the NCrF?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four out of the five statements accurately describe the NCrF's key features. The framework indeed aims to create a unified credit system across different education sectors (statement 1) and integrates existing qualification frameworks (statement 2).  The NCrF also promotes flexibility through multiple entry and exit points (statement 3), and sets a standard number of notional learning hours (statement 4). However, while the NCrF facilitates skill development, its primary focus is not specifically on enhancing employability skills through vocational training (statement 5) — it's broader than that, encompassing all forms of learning. Therefore, only four statements correctly describe core NCrF features.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1. It is released annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).
2. It assesses hunger levels based on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved since 2015.
4. South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently show the highest hunger levels.
5. The GHI methodology has faced criticism from some governments.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the GHI?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four statements are accurate. The GHI uses the four indicators mentioned in statement 2, and statement 4 correctly identifies the regions with the highest hunger levels.  Statement 5 is also true, as the GHI methodology has indeed faced criticism. However, statement 1 is false: the GHI is not released by the WFP, but by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  Further, statement 3 is also incorrect:  while India's score has shown some improvement, it hasn't consistently improved since 2015.  Therefore, only four statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1.  It aims to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status across all villages in India.
2.  ODF Plus status requires sustaining ODF status and implementing solid and/or liquid waste management systems.
3.  ODF Plus Model villages must demonstrate visual cleanliness and display IEC messages.
4.  The Swachh Bharat Mission is entirely funded by the state governments.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the objectives and criteria of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)'s goals and criteria. The mission's primary objective is to achieve ODF status nationwide (statement 1).  The ODF Plus criteria include maintaining ODF status while implementing waste management systems (statement 2), and model villages must also meet visual cleanliness standards and display informational materials (statement 3). However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Swachh Bharat Mission is a centrally sponsored scheme, involving both central and state government funding. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following international organizations:**

1.  The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
2.  The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA)
3.  The United Nations Commission on Population and Development (UNCPD)
4.  The World Food Programme (WFP)
5.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI)

How many of the above are United Nations (UN) agencies or affiliated organizations?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four of the listed organizations are UN agencies or closely affiliated.  The UNFPA, UNDESA, and UNCPD are all UN entities (statements 1, 2, and 3).  While the WFP is a joint UN program, it is still primarily considered a UN agency (statement 4).  However, the IFPRI, although involved in UN-related work, is an independent research institute, not a UN agency (statement 5).  Therefore, only four are UN agencies or affiliated organizations.

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, did indeed modify the previous prohibition on donor gametes, allowing their use under specific conditions where the intending couple has a medical need. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, also correctly establishes the legal framework for altruistic surrogacy while criminalizing commercial practices.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the ART Act, 2021, explicitly includes surrogacy within its regulatory scope. Statement 4 is incorrect; traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate is genetically related to the child, is generally not permitted under the current legal framework in India, which primarily focuses on gestational surrogacy.

3.  The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training in alternative employment and financial assistance.
4.  The PEMSR Act exempts individuals cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear from its provisions.
5.  The PEMSR Act designates only local authorities as responsible for identifying manual scavengers.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect provisions of the PEMSR Act. The act prohibits the handling of untreated human waste, criminalizes the construction of insanitary latrines, mandates rehabilitation efforts, and provides an exception for those using protective gear. Statement 5 is incorrect; the responsibility for identifying manual scavengers extends beyond local authorities to include other relevant entities like cantonment boards and railway authorities.  Therefore, four statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**8. Consider the following initiatives aimed at improving the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Saksham Anganwadis focus on strengthening and upgrading Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) across the country to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.
2.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used for dynamic identification of malnutrition prevalence among children and tracking nutrition service delivery.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed honorarium per month, with no performance-linked incentives.
4.  The Anganwadi system is solely focused on children aged 0-6 years, excluding adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.

How many of the above statements accurately describe initiatives related to improving the Anganwadi system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe initiatives related to improving the Anganwadi system. Saksham Anganwadis aim to upgrade AWCs, and the Poshan Tracker app is used for monitoring and data collection. Statement 3 is incorrect; AWWs and AWHs do receive performance-linked incentives in addition to their fixed honorarium. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Anganwadi system's scope has expanded to include adolescent girls and early childhood care and education.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF) in India:**

1. The NIF includes indicators aligned with global SDG indicators and those tailored to India's specific needs.
2.  The NIF is static and unchanging, with a fixed number of indicators.
3.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and circulating guidelines for State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).
4.  The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is developed solely by the Indian government to guide national SDG reporting.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the SDGs National Indicator Framework (NIF) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately describe the NIF.  It does include both global and India-specific indicators, and MoSPI plays a crucial role in developing guidelines for SIFs. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF is dynamic and evolves over time. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the GIF is an international framework developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), not solely the Indian government. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the NIF.


**10. Consider the following statements about the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and its activities:**

1.  The UNFPA is a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly and receives policy guidance from the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).
2.  The UNFPA's mandate includes ensuring sexual and reproductive rights and choices for all, particularly women and young people.
3.  The UNFPA's "three zeros" targets aim to end unmet needs for family planning, preventable maternal deaths, and gender-based violence by 2030.
4.  The UNFPA's State of World Population report focuses exclusively on population growth in high-income countries.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the UNFPA's role and objectives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the UNFPA. It is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, guided by ECOSOC; its mandate includes reproductive rights; and its "three zeros" are a key focus.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the UNFPA's State of World Population report covers global trends, not exclusively high-income countries. Therefore, only three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for tribal welfare.
2.  The highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) is found in Odisha.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is found in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.
4.  The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed on August 9th.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for overseeing tribal welfare initiatives in India. Odisha does house the highest number of PVTGs among all Indian states.  The Bharia tribe is correctly identified as a PVTG present in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While August 9th is indeed associated with indigenous peoples' rights, it's the International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples, not specifically "World Tribal Day." The term "World Tribal Day" is a more general designation that might not be officially recognized in the same way the UN-designated day is.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorized certain nomadic tribes as "born criminals."
2.  The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by Denotified Tribes (DNTs) communities.
4.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated 15 crore Indians belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the status of nomadic and denotified tribes in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate. The British-era Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 unjustly labelled certain nomadic communities as inherently criminal, a stigma that continues to affect their lives. The Hakki Pikki tribe is correctly identified as a semi-nomadic group residing in Karnataka.  August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.  Finally, the Renke Commission's 2008 report did provide an estimate of 15 crore Indians belonging to nomadic, semi-nomadic, and DNT communities, highlighting the significant population size of these groups and their continued vulnerability.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act's reservation policy applies to all police forces in India.
4.  The Act establishes special courts in every district for faster adjudication of cases.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. The Act does stipulate a minimum 5% reservation for PwDs in higher education and government jobs. It also correctly lists 21 types of recognized disabilities, encompassing a broader range of conditions than previously acknowledged. The establishment of special courts in each district to expedite case resolution is another key feature of the Act.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act's reservation policy explicitly excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police forces). Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013:**

1.  The Act prohibits the employment of manual scavengers in any capacity.
2.  The Act prescribes a punishment of up to two years imprisonment or a fine of up to one lakh rupees, or both, for violations.
3.  The Act defines "manual scavengers" to include only individuals explicitly employed to handle human waste.
4.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.


Which of the above statements correctly represent provisions of the Act?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Act's provisions. The Act explicitly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and sets out penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines. However, statement 3 is not entirely accurate; the definition of manual scavengers is broader than simply those directly employed to handle human waste; it includes those working with undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, regardless of their formal employment status. Similarly, statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines but doesn't set a rigid, universally applicable timeframe for this process, as local contexts and circumstances would influence the timeline.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully correct.


**5.  Consider the following regarding the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:**

1.  It aims to destigmatize menstruation and ensure a stigma-free experience for all who menstruate.
2.  It prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations, including girls and women of reproductive age.
3.  It mandates paid menstrual leave for all workers in India.
4.  It focuses solely on providing menstrual hygiene resources, like sanitary pads.

Which of the following statements accurately reflect the aims of the draft policy?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are core components of the draft policy.  The policy aims to address the stigma surrounding menstruation and promote a more positive and accepting environment for all who menstruate.  It also prioritizes reaching underserved and vulnerable groups to ensure equitable access to menstrual health resources and services. Statement 3 is incorrect; the policy doesn't mandate paid menstrual leave, though some countries have implemented such policies separately.  Statement 4 is also incorrect because the policy's scope is broader than just providing material resources; it encompasses education, awareness, and addressing systemic barriers to menstrual hygiene. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016:**

1.  It prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in all forms of employment.
2.  It prohibits the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.
3.  It mandates universal free education for all children below 14 years.
4.  It establishes a nationwide network of rehabilitation centres for all child labourers.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Act correctly prohibits child labour below the age of 14 and restricts adolescent employment in hazardous occupations (statements 1 and 2).  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the Act aims to prevent child labour to enable schooling, it doesn’t mandate universal free education.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act supports rehabilitation efforts but doesn't mandate a nationwide network of centres.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately represent the Act's provisions.


**7. Consider the following about the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1.  It defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.
2.  It allows for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for heinous offences.
3.  It eliminates the role of Juvenile Justice Boards in determining the trial process for children.
4.  It mandates the adoption of all children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) after one year of parental absence.

Which statements accurately reflect provisions of the Act?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Act correctly defines a child as someone under 18 and allows for the possibility of trying 16-18-year-olds as adults for heinous crimes (statements 1 and 2). However, statement 3 is incorrect; Juvenile Justice Boards retain a crucial role in assessing whether to try a child as an adult or juvenile. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act doesn’t automatically mandate adoption after a year of parental absence; it outlines processes for determining a child's best interests, which may or may not involve adoption.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1.  It mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all organizations with 10 or more employees.
2.  It defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact and advances.
3.  It allows for monetary settlements as a means of conciliation in sexual harassment cases.
4.  It provides for appeals to the court against ICC decisions.

Which of the above statements accurately describe provisions of the POSH Act?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act correctly mandates ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees (statement 1) and allows for appeals against ICC decisions (statement 4).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the definition of sexual harassment is much broader than just physical contact and advances, encompassing a wider range of unwelcome acts or behavior of a sexual nature. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**9. Consider the following concerning the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act:**

1.  It allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks on the advice of one doctor.
2.  It allows termination of pregnancy between 20 and 24 weeks only in specific circumstances, requiring the advice of two doctors.
3.  It permits termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks only on grounds of fetal abnormalities.
4.  It explicitly permits abortion on demand for all women.

Which of the above statements accurately represent the provisions of the MTP Act?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act correctly allows for pregnancy termination up to 20 weeks with one doctor's advice, between 20-24 weeks under specified circumstances with two doctors' advice, and beyond 24 weeks only for fetal abnormalities (statements 1, 2, and 3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act does not allow for abortion on demand for all women; it sets specific conditions and limitations. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements related to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA):**

1.  It defines domestic violence to include only physical abuse.
2.  It allows for the filing of complaints only by the aggrieved woman herself.
3.  It provides for various reliefs, including shelter homes and medical aid for victims.
4.  It is applicable only to married women.

Which of the above statements accurately describe provisions of the PWDVA?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The PWDVA defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.  Complaints can be filed by the aggrieved woman, but also by others on her behalf.  The Act provides for various reliefs, including shelter homes and medical assistance.  The Act is not limited to married women; it covers women in various domestic relationships. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately represents the PWDVA.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Panchsheel Principles for Tribal Development:**

1.  They emphasize the importance of respecting tribal rights to land and forests.
2.  They advocate for the imposition of alien values to uplift tribal communities.
3.  They promote training tribal teams for administrative and development work.
4.  They suggest overwhelming tribal areas with numerous development schemes.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Panchsheel Principles?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly reflect the Panchsheel Principles.  The principles emphasize respecting tribal land and forest rights and advocate for empowering tribal communities through training in administration and development.  Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect; the principles explicitly oppose the imposition of alien values and warn against overwhelming tribal areas with too many schemes.  Therefore, only two of the statements accurately reflect the principles.


**12. Consider the following about the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023:**

1.  It establishes the NRF to provide strategic direction for research and innovation across various scientific fields.
2.  It designates the Prime Minister as the President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3.  It abolishes the Department of Science and Technology's role in research funding.
4.  It solely relies on central government grants for its funding.

Which statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Act correctly establishes the NRF for strategic direction in research and innovation and designates the Prime Minister as the Governing Board's President (statements 1 and 2). However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Department of Science and Technology retains a significant role, serving as the administrative department for the NRF.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NRF's funding sources are diverse, including government grants, donations, investments, and existing research funds.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**13. Consider the following statements concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  It proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling.
2.  It mandates the elimination of board examinations for grades 10 and 12.
3.  It emphasizes multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages.
4.  It strictly separates academic and vocational subjects.

Which statements accurately reflect the key highlights of the NCF-SE?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCF-SE correctly proposes a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure and emphasizes multilingualism (statements 1 and 3).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; it allows for multiple attempts at board exams, not their elimination. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the framework aims for flexibility and integration between academic and vocational subjects.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the NCF-SE's highlights.


**14. Consider the following regarding the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020:**

1.  It aims to increase public investment in education to 6% of GDP.
2.  It sets a target of 100% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) at the secondary level by 2030.
3.  It establishes PARAKH as a new national assessment centre.
4.  It mandates the adoption of a single, uniform curriculum across all states.

Which of the following statements accurately represent the aims and features of NEP 2020?

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NEP 2020 correctly aims to increase educational investment to 6% of GDP, sets a target of 100% GER at the secondary level by 2030, and establishes PARAKH (statements 1, 2, and 3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; the NEP allows for flexibility in curriculum development at the state level while providing a broad framework.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**15. Consider the following about Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status.
2.  The regulations mandate that all DTBUs must be managed by a single sponsoring body.
3.  DTBUs can start new courses or programs with the approval of their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils.
4.  The regulations prohibit DTBUs from creating Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the salient features of the regulations?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 regulations correctly allow institutions younger than 20 years to apply for DTBU status and allow DTBUs to start new courses with the necessary approvals (statements 1 and 3).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the regulations permit clusters of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies to apply. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the regulations mandate the creation of ABC identities for students.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**16. Consider the following regarding the UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India] Regulations, 2023:**

1.  FHEIs require UGC approval before establishing campuses in India.
2.  Only FHEIs ranked among the top 100 globally are eligible to establish campuses in India.
3.  FHEIs are allowed to offer online and distance learning programs.

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are accurate.  The regulations mandate UGC approval for FHEI campus establishment in India and require compliance with relevant Indian laws.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the eligibility criterion is a ranking within the top 500 globally, not the top 100. Statement 3 is also incorrect; online and distance learning programs are prohibited under these regulations.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.


**17.  Consider the following about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It aims to seamlessly integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  It is based solely on the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF).
3.  It seeks to enhance flexibility and mobility in education across different sectors.
4.  It is exclusively managed by the University Grants Commission (UGC).

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the features of the NCrF?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF correctly aims to integrate credits across different education sectors and enhance flexibility and mobility (statements 1 and 3). However, statement 2 is incorrect; it incorporates multiple frameworks, including NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it is jointly developed and managed by multiple bodies, not solely the UGC.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**18. Consider the following regarding the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023:**

1.  It shows significant progress in reducing global hunger since 2015.
2.  It ranks India among the countries with "serious" hunger levels.
3.  It uses a methodology free from any criticisms or controversies.
4.  It identifies South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the highest hunger levels.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the GHI 2023?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate. The GHI 2023 does categorize India as having "serious" hunger levels, and it correctly identifies South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the highest levels of hunger.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report shows limited progress in reducing global hunger since 2015. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the GHI's methodology has faced criticism and controversy regarding its data sources and methodology. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the GHI 2023 findings.


**19. Consider the following about the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1.  It defines ODF (Open Defecation Free) status based solely on the absence of visible faeces in the environment.
2.  It has achieved ODF Plus status in all Indian villages.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village must have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management.
4.  ODF Plus status requires the display of IEC messages related to ODF Plus.

Which statements accurately describe the ODF status and its criteria under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin)?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  An ODF Plus Model village requires arrangements for solid and liquid waste management and the display of IEC messages.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the ODF definition includes both the absence of visible faeces and the use of safe sanitation technology by all households. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while significant progress has been made, ODF Plus status hasn't been achieved in all Indian villages.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are accurate.


**20. Consider the following regarding the initiatives taken to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India:**

1.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses solely on tertiary healthcare.
2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to improve access to healthcare through technology.
3.  The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC at an affordable cost.
4.  Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets only pregnant women for vaccination.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives related to UHC in India?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the initiatives.  ABDM uses technology to improve healthcare access, and the National Health Policy 2017 aims for affordable UHC.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; Ayushman Bharat Yojana addresses primary, secondary, and tertiary healthcare.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; Intensified Mission Indradhanush targets both children and pregnant women. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the UHC initiatives.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI):**

1. It was established in 1975.
2. Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. It is a research center under the CGIAR.
4.  A key focus is providing research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: IFPRI was indeed established in 1975.  Statement 2 is incorrect; IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva.  Statement 3 is correct: IFPRI is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). Statement 4 is also correct: A core function of IFPRI is to offer research-based policy solutions to mitigate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition. Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR):**

1.  It was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950.
2.  Its mandate includes saving lives, protecting rights, and building a better future for internally displaced persons.
3.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are fundamental legal documents guiding its work.
4. The UNHCR headquarters is in New York City.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1950. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while the UNHCR works to improve the lives of refugees, its mandate specifically focuses on those forced to flee their homes due to conflict and persecution, not necessarily internally displaced persons. Statement 3 is correct: The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are key legal frameworks for the UNHCR's operations. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UNHCR headquarters is located in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


**3. Consider the following concerning the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI):**

1. GANHRI's headquarters are located in Washington, D.C.
2.  It is responsible for reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

UNPFII (UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues) correctly addresses indigenous peoples' issues, encompassing economic, social, cultural, environmental, educational, health, and human rights aspects. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the UNFPA (United Nations Population Fund) addresses issues related to gender-based violence, its mandate is broader, encompassing sexual and reproductive health and rights for all, especially women and young people.  Therefore, only three of the statements correctly link the organization to its primary focus.


**3. Consider the following regarding the 2023 Global Hunger Index (GHI):**

1.  It was released by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
2. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa showed the highest hunger levels.
3. India's GHI score showed a significant worsening compared to 2015.
4. The Indian government did not raise objections to the GHI methodology.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the 2023 GHI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank and IMF. Statement 2 is correct; South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa did indeed register the highest hunger levels according to the report. Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's GHI score was still categorized as "serious," it showed a *slight improvement* compared to 2015, not a worsening.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. The Indian government *did* raise objections to the GHI report, citing methodological concerns, sample size limitations, and data source issues.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the National Nutrition Mission (POSHAN Abhiyan):**

1. It was launched in 2017 with the aim of eradicating malnutrition completely by 2030.
2.  It primarily focuses on improving the utilization of Anganwadi services.
3. The Poshan Tracker app is used to monitor nutrition service delivery and identify malnutrition.
4.  The scheme's key beneficiaries are only children below the age of six years.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the POSHAN Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While POSHAN Abhiyan aims to significantly reduce malnutrition, it does not claim complete eradication by 2030. Statement 2 is correct; the mission focuses on improving the effectiveness of Anganwadi services to combat malnutrition. Statement 3 is also correct; the Poshan Tracker app is a key tool for monitoring and data collection. Statement 4 is incorrect. The POSHAN Abhiyan targets a broader range of beneficiaries, including pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under six.  Therefore, only three of the given statements are accurate representations of the POSHAN Abhiyan.


**5. Consider the following about the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1. It mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and private sector jobs.
2. It recognizes 21 categories of disabilities.
3. It provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to the age of 18.
4. It excludes police forces from the reservation mandate for PwDs.


Which of the above statements are correct according to the Act?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act mandates reservation in government jobs and government-aided educational institutions, but not in the private sector.  Statement 2 is correct; the Act does recognize 21 categories of disabilities. Statement 3 is also correct; it guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities up to age 18. Statement 4 is correct; the Act specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy. Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate according to the Act.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. It proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling.
2. It mandates the learning of at least five languages by all students.
3. It aims to create hard separations between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.
4. It emphasizes the development of capacities for scientific inquiry in science education.

How many of these statements accurately reflect the NCF-SE?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCF-SE does propose a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The framework recommends proficiency in at least *three* languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages, not five. Statement 3 is incorrect; it specifically aims to *reduce* the rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects. Statement 4 is correct; it strongly emphasizes scientific inquiry skills in science education. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect the NCF-SE's key features.


**7. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  It is a framework solely for higher education.
2. It integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational training.
3. Credits earned can be stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).
4. It eliminates multiple entry and exit options in the education system.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the NCrF?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF is not limited to higher education; it's a meta-framework encompassing school, higher, and vocational education. Statement 2 is correct; it aims for seamless integration of credits across these educational levels. Statement 3 is also correct; the ABC is a key component for storing and managing earned credits. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCrF *enables* multiple entry and exit points, promoting flexibility and lifelong learning.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately represent the NCrF.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen):**

1.  It aims to achieve 100% Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in all Indian villages by 2024.
2. An ODF Plus village has sustained ODF status and implemented solid or liquid waste management systems.
3.  ODF Plus Model villages demonstrate visual cleanliness and awareness campaigns.
4. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is the nodal ministry for the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin).

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the mission aims for widespread ODF Plus status, it doesn't set a specific year for 100% achievement. Statements 2 and 3 are correct; they accurately define ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model villages. Statement 4 is incorrect; the nodal ministry for Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) is the Ministry of Jal Shakti.  Therefore, only three statements correctly reflect aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).


**9. Consider the following regarding the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC):**

1. It is a body of 18 independent experts that monitors the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
2. The Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted in 1989 and has been ratified by nearly 200 state parties.
3.  The UNCRC issues guidelines only on children's right to education.
4. The UNCRC is primarily focused on addressing child labour issues worldwide.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the UNCRC and its functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The UNCRC is indeed a body of 18 independent experts, monitoring the implementation of the 1989 Convention, which has been ratified by a large number of countries. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The UNCRC's guidance extends beyond education to encompass a wide range of children's rights. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while child labour is a concern, the UNCRC's mandate covers a far broader spectrum of children's rights and well-being.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the UNCRC.


**10. Consider the following concerning the  National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR):**

1. It issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offences under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015.
2. The NCPCR is a statutory body under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
3.  The NCPCR's primary focus is on the rehabilitation of child labourers.
4. The NCPCR has the power to directly prosecute individuals involved in child abuse cases.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the NCPCR's role and functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCPCR has indeed issued guidelines for assessing child suspects in heinous offenses.  Statement 2 is also correct; it is a statutory body under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NCPCR's mandate is broader than just child labour rehabilitation; it covers the overall protection of child rights. Statement 4 is incorrect; the NCPCR doesn't have direct prosecutorial powers but can recommend action and investigate child rights violations.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the NCPCR.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
2.  The term "PVTGs" replaced "PTGs" in 2006.
3.  Odisha currently houses the most PVTGs in India.
4.  A pre-agricultural level of technology is a criterion for identifying PVTGs.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect characteristics of PVTGs.  The initial categorization as PTGs in 1973, the renaming to PVTGs in 2006, Odisha's current position as the state with the highest number of PVTGs, and the inclusion of pre-agricultural technology as a defining criterion are all factually correct.  There are no misleading elements in these statements; they directly reflect the provided information.


**2. Consider the following statements about De-Notified Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 labeled DNTs as "born criminals."
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 15 crore Indians belong to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic tribes.
4.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Criminal Tribes Act wrongly labeled DNTs, the Renke Commission provided the population estimate, and August 31st is indeed Vimukta Jatis Day. The other options incorrectly include the false statement.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding government initiatives for DNTs:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a state-wise list of DNT castes.
2.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme constructs hostels exclusively for DNT boys.
3.  The SEED scheme provides health insurance solely to DNT heads of households.
4.  A Development and Welfare Board for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Communities was established in 2019.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 4 are correct; the NCDNT prepares the state-wise list, and the Development and Welfare Board was established in 2019. However, statement 2 is incorrect as the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme provides hostels for both boys and girls. Statement 3 is also incorrect, as SEED provides health insurance to families, not just the head of household.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including acid attack victims.
3.  Free education for children with benchmark disabilities is limited to special schools.
4.  The Act establishes a special court in every district to adjudicate cases.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct:  The RPwD Act does recognize 21 disabilities, including those resulting from acid attacks, and it does aim for special courts in each district. However, statement 1 is incorrect because the 4% reservation applies to government jobs, not all government jobs. Statement 3 is also incorrect; free education is available in neighborhood schools or special schools.


**5. Consider the following about the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as only those handling human waste from insanitary latrines.
2.  The Act permits cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear.
3.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines immediately upon its enactment.
4.  The Act's rehabilitation provisions include training for alternate employment and financial assistance.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 4 are correct: The Act allows waste cleaning with protective gear and includes rehabilitation measures.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the definition includes other sources beyond insanitary latrines. Statement 3 is also incorrect, as the Act provides a timeframe for demolition, not immediate action.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  The PGI assesses school education performance at the state and district levels.
2.  The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 classified states/UTs into five grades.
3.  The PGI-D report combined data from 2020-21 and 2021-22.
4.  In PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The PGI does assess performance at both levels, the PGI-D combined data, and no entity reached "Daksh" in PGI 2.0.  Statement 2 is incorrect; PGI 2.0 used ten grades, not five.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NEP aims for the GER, promotes MERUs, and mandates the NRF. Statement 2 is incorrect; it allows for both three-year and four-year undergraduate programs.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements correctly describe aspects of the 2023 regulations.  The age limit change, allowing clusters to apply, the ABC requirement, and the Executive Council approval for new courses are all accurate.


**9. Consider the following about the UGC [Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India] Regulations, 2023:**

1.  FHEIs need UGC approval to establish Indian campuses.
2.  FHEIs must be ranked among the top 500 globally to be eligible.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  FHEIs need UGC approval for campuses, must meet the top 500 ranking criterion (or have exceptional expertise), and need permission for foreign donations. Statement 3 is incorrect; online and distance learning are prohibited.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  The NCrF integrates credits from school, higher, and vocational education.
2.  The NCrF uses a nine-level credit system.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NCrF does integrate credits, encompasses the NHEQF, and includes experiential learning. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NCrF uses an eight-level system.


**11. Consider the following statements related to the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1.  The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually.
2.  The index assesses economic participation, education, health, and political empowerment.
3.  India's 2023 ranking was below 100.
4.  The index measures women's representation in local governance.

How many of the statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The World Economic Forum releases the index, it uses the four parameters listed, and India's 2023 ranking was indeed below 100 (at 127). Statement 4 is incorrect; while the index considers related factors, it doesn't directly measure local governance representation as a core parameter, though it may reflect in the overall score.


**12. Consider the following about the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT):**

1.  The CSTT works on technical terminology in languages included in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The CSTT does work on Eighth Schedule languages, was established in 1961 via Presidential Order, and aims to develop terminology in all Indian languages. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CSTT operates under Article 344(4), not Article 356.  Article 356 relates to President's Rule in states.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are correct. Abortion is generally illegal except under the MTP Act, the 2021 amendment extended the time limit (though not to 24 weeks for all, as stated, which was a change but not to this extent), the original act included grounds like rape, and the new code has provisions on miscarriage.  The wording in statement 2 is slightly inaccurate regarding the 24-week limit.  However, it is not significantly misleading and the overall statement remains true.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The Anusandhan NRF is established, the Prime Minister heads the board, and SERB was repealed.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the NRF's funding also comes from other sources like donations and investments.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on social issues.  The questions are designed to be challenging, with plausible distractors and requiring factual recall and analytical skills.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding ODF Plus villages:**

1.  Sustained ODF status is a prerequisite.
2.  Implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems is mandatory.
3.  Visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater, is essential.
4.  ODF Plus IEC messages must be displayed prominently.
5.  Arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management are sufficient for ODF Plus status.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the criteria for an ODF Plus village?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly reflect the criteria for ODF Plus villages as defined in the text.  Statement 1 accurately states that sustained ODF status is the foundational requirement.  Statement 2 specifies that at least one waste management system (solid or liquid) must be in place.  Statement 3 highlights the importance of visual cleanliness, a crucial aspect of ODF Plus.  Statement 4 emphasizes the display of IEC messages, further solidifying the commitment to hygiene and awareness.  Statement 5 is incorrect; while having both systems is ideal for an ODF Plus *model* village, it's not a strict requirement for ODF Plus status itself.  The text explicitly states *either* solid *or* liquid waste management systems are sufficient.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following statements about the UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023:**

1.  It projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2023.
2.  It highlights India's relatively young population, with a significant proportion in the 15-64 age group.
3.  It indicates a declining fertility rate in India, currently standing at 2.0.
4.  It predicts migration as the primary driver of population growth in low-income countries.
5.  It reports a life expectancy of 73 years for Indian males and 75 years for Indian females.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key findings of the report regarding India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the report's findings on India. The report indeed projects India surpassing China in population, highlights India's young population, and notes the declining fertility rate.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the report actually predicts migration as the primary driver of population growth in *high-income* countries, not low-income ones. Statement 5 is also incorrect;  the report gives slightly different figures for life expectancy: 71 years for males and 74 for females.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1.  It uses UDISE+ data and NAS data for assessment.
2.  It grades states/UTs and districts into ten grades.

4.  PGI-D combines data from 2019-20 and 2020-21.
5.  The PGI 2.0 report shows a significant reduction in the deviation between the maximum and minimum scores obtained by States/UTs compared to the first PGI report.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the PGI?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct.  The PGI utilizes UDISE+ and NAS data, employs a ten-grade system, and in PGI 2.0, no state/UT achieved the highest grade.  The reduction in score deviation between states is also highlighted in PGI 2.0. Statement 4 is incorrect; PGI-D combines data from 2020-21 & 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21. Therefore, four statements accurately describe the PGI.
