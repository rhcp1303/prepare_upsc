Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows termination of pregnancy up to 20 weeks for all women on the advice of one doctor.  For pregnancies between 20 and 24 weeks, specific categories of women can access abortion with the advice of two doctors.  The timeframe of 28 weeks is not explicitly mentioned in the act for unrestricted access.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling clarified that for the purposes of the MTP Act, the definition of rape includes marital rape, expanding access to safe and legal abortion for women in this situation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act allows termination beyond 24 weeks only in cases of substantial fetal abnormalities, requiring the opinion of a medical board. This emphasizes the need for expert medical judgment in such complex situations.  The restrictive nature of this provision underscores the legal and ethical considerations surrounding late-term abortions.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, 2005, provides criminal remedies for marital rape.
2.  The Act defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse.
3.  A complaint under the PWDVA can be filed against relatives of the husband or male partner, including both male and female relatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005 primarily provides civil remedies for domestic violence, including marital rape.  It does not initiate criminal proceedings against the perpetrator; separate legal avenues must be pursued for criminal action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PWDVA has a broader definition of domestic violence. It explicitly includes physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse, recognizing the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act allows complaints to be filed against the husband or male partner and their relatives, encompassing both male and female relatives.  This reflects an understanding that domestic violence can involve a wider network of individuals.  The Supreme Court's 2016 ruling further broadened the definition by removing the specification of "adult male."


**3. Consider the following statements regarding initiatives to promote women in STEM:**

1. The Boeing Sukanya Program focuses solely on providing scholarships to women pursuing pilot training.

2.  The Act defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact and demands for sexual favors.
3.  An aggrieved woman must file a complaint within one month of the incident under the POSH Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) None
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every workplace with 10 or more employees, not five.  Organizations with fewer employees have alternative grievance redressal mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of sexual harassment under the POSH Act is much broader. It includes physical contact or advances, demands or requests for sexual favors, making sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, and any other unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The POSH Act allows for complaints to be filed within three months of the incident, giving a more reasonable timeframe for reporting.  The ICC also has the power to extend this timeframe under certain circumstances.


**5.  Consider the following statements about the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023:**

1. The policy prioritizes access to menstrual hygiene resources for all menstruating individuals, including underserved and vulnerable populations.
2.  The policy advocates for mandatory paid menstrual leave for all working women in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, aims to address menstrual hygiene comprehensively, recognizing menstruation as a natural process and prioritizing equitable access to resources for all, particularly underserved groups.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Spain has implemented paid menstrual leave, the Indian policy does not mandate this. The policy focuses on creating a stigma-free environment and ensuring access to resources, but it does not address paid leave.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The policy's scope is much broader than just providing free sanitary napkins. It addresses various aspects of menstrual hygiene management, including access to resources, education, and the elimination of stigma.  The provision of sanitary napkins might be one component, but it is not the sole focus.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of officially recognized PVTGs in India.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively located in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs, as outlined in government documents and academic literature,  indeed include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy rates, significant economic backwardness, and a population that is either stagnant or declining. These indicators reflect a vulnerability to mainstream societal pressures and a need for targeted interventions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Official government data consistently shows Odisha as having the highest number of PVTGs. While the exact number might fluctuate slightly depending on the source and year of data, Odisha consistently tops the list.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bharia tribe is recognized as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, highlighting the complexities of tribal distribution across state boundaries and the need for coordinated policies across administrative units.  The statement's assertion of exclusivity to Madhya Pradesh is inaccurate.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are Denotified Tribes, but not all Denotified Tribes are nomadic.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities to commemorate their legal recognition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not that all nomadic tribes are DNTs. While many DNTs have nomadic or semi-nomadic traditions, the categorization isn't absolute.  The DNT designation is based on historical criminalization, not solely on nomadic lifestyles.  Many nomadic groups were never labeled as criminal tribes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a deeply discriminatory piece of legislation, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. However, the repeal didn't fully address the social and economic disadvantages faced by communities previously labeled under the Act.  The legacy of the Criminal Tribes Act continues to affect DNTs.

Statement 3 is correct. August 31st is indeed observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities to mark a symbolic reclaiming of their identity and social standing after the historical injustices they faced.  The date signifies their ongoing struggle for recognition and rights.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those caused by acid attacks.
3. The Act establishes special courts in every district to expedite the adjudication of cases related to its violations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RPwD Act does mandate reservations for persons with disabilities in government jobs and higher educational institutions,  this reservation explicitly excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police forces).  The statement incorrectly includes these forces.

Statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act significantly broadened the definition of disability, recognizing 21 types, a crucial step towards inclusivity.  The inclusion of intellectual disabilities and those resulting from acid attacks reflects a more comprehensive understanding of disability.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act aims to provide swift justice to those affected by violations of its provisions. Establishing special courts in each district is intended to streamline the legal process and ensure quicker redressal of grievances.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1. The Act defines manual scavenging as the removal of human excreta by hand from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, irrespective of the presence of protective gear.
2.  The Act makes it an offence to construct insanitary latrines but does not hold local authorities responsible for demolishing or converting such latrines.
3. The Act mandates rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment, financial assistance, and property acquisition support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act's definition of manual scavenging explicitly excludes situations where individuals clean human waste using appropriate protective gear and equipment. The presence or absence of protective gear is a crucial distinction in the legal definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act does make constructing insanitary latrines an offense.  Furthermore, it explicitly assigns responsibility to local authorities for the demolition or conversion of such latrines within a specified timeframe.  The statement misrepresents the Act's provisions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Rehabilitation is a central component of the PEMSR Act.  The Act lays down procedures and provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including training for alternate employment, financial aid, and assistance in acquiring property.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, measured as the percentage of the 18-23 age group enrolled.
2. NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NEP 2020 sets an ambitious goal for expanding access to higher education, aiming for a GER of at least 50% by 2035.  The age group used for calculation (18-23) is also accurately stated.

Statement 2 is correct.  NEP 2020 fundamentally reshaped the structure of school education, introducing a new 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups,  replacing the previous four-stage system. This restructuring aimed to improve learning outcomes and provide greater flexibility.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While NEP 2020 does propose the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF) to boost research and innovation, it's not limited to natural sciences and engineering. The NRF's scope is much broader, encompassing various disciplines, including the scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences.


**6. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education, using a system of 8 levels.
2.  The NCrF allows credits to be earned solely through formal academic programs and does not recognize experiential learning.
3. The NCrF utilizes the concept of "notional learning hours" to standardize credit allocation across different educational pathways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF's core objective is to create a unified credit system encompassing various educational pathways. The framework's design uses eight levels to accommodate diverse learning experiences, from school to higher education and vocational training.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCrF is designed to be inclusive, recognizing that learning happens in multiple ways.  It allows for credit accumulation through experiential learning, such as relevant experience and proficiency levels gained from industries, alongside formal academic programs.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCrF employs the concept of "notional learning hours" to provide a standard measure for credit allocation across different educational streams. This standardization helps ensure fair credit transfer and recognition of diverse learning experiences.


**7. With reference to the  Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) and is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government and no performance-linked incentives.
3. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to strengthen and upgrade Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) solely focusing on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Anganwadi system is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under MoWCD and forms a crucial component of the ICDS scheme.  This accurately reflects the administrative structure and policy context of the program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives.  These incentives are designed to motivate and reward effective service delivery.  The statement omits a key aspect of the compensation structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative has a broader scope than just improving the nutritional status of young children.  It aims to holistically strengthen AWCs, including enhancing early childhood care and education, and engaging with adolescent girls, particularly in aspirational districts and the North Eastern Region.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI is released annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and ranks countries based on four indicators of hunger.
2.  In the 2023 GHI report, India's ranking and score showed a significant improvement compared to the 2015 report, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger.
3.  The Indian government has consistently supported the GHI methodology and data sources used in the index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is not released by the WFP; it's a joint publication of Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  The statement incorrectly attributes the publication to the WFP.  Furthermore, while the GHI uses four indicators, the statement doesn't specify which indicators.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's GHI score did show a slight improvement from 2015 to 2023, it's not a significant improvement. The improvement is marginal and India still falls in the "serious" category, indicating that hunger remains a significant challenge.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian government has consistently raised objections to the GHI methodology, data sources, and the index's overall conclusions.  The government has cited methodological issues, sample size concerns, and the use of data sources it deems unreliable.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1. PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), based on the recommendations of the Elwin Committee.
2. Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding 15.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), based on the recommendations of the **Dhebar** Commission (1961), not the Elwin Committee. The Elwin Committee's recommendations focused on tribal welfare and development, but didn't directly lead to the initial categorization of PTGs.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does house a significant number of PVTGs, the provided text states it has 13, not exceeding 15.  The actual number may be higher, but based solely on the provided text, this statement is false.


Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly lists pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population as criteria for PVTG identification. These factors reflect the vulnerability and unique challenges faced by these groups.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of the criteria used for classifying various social groups, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuanced definitions used by the government.


**2. With reference to De-notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1. The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India, comprising over 10 crore Indians.
2. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.
3.  Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated annually on August 31st by DNT communities to commemorate the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Renke Commission estimated nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, comprising 15 crore (150 million), not over 10 crore (100 million), Indians.  Precise numerical data on marginalized communities is crucial for policy formulation and resource allocation, making this a relevant detail for UPSC aspirants.


Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. This historical context is vital for understanding the ongoing challenges faced by DNTs and the government's efforts towards their rehabilitation and upliftment.  The UPSC frequently tests knowledge of significant historical legislation and its impact on social groups.


Statement 3 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions August 31st as Vimukta Jatis Day, celebrated by DNT communities.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding the cultural and social contexts surrounding the lives of marginalized communities.  UPSC questions often assess awareness of such commemorative days and their significance.



**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least a 6% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 5 and 17.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is close but incorrect. The report states that around 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced, not approximately 100 million.  The precise figure, though seemingly minor, is important in accurately reflecting the scale of the displacement crisis.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report indeed shows that a significant majority (76%) of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries, highlighting the disproportionate burden carried by these nations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report indicates that children make up 30% of the forcibly displaced population, significantly higher than 25%. This underscores the vulnerability of children in displacement situations and the need for targeted protection measures.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme's primary goal is to improve the nutritional and health conditions of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  This is a central objective of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While AWWs receive a fixed monthly honorarium, they also receive performance-linked incentives for utilizing the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyan.  This incentivizes effective data management and service delivery.

Statement 3 is correct. The Poshan Tracker app is a key tool for monitoring nutrition programs and identifying children who are stunted, wasted, or underweight, enabling timely interventions.  It helps in tracking service delivery at the grassroots level.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did improve slightly from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023, this is a marginal improvement, not a significant one. The overall ranking and categorization remain largely unchanged, indicating persistent challenges in addressing hunger.

Statement 2 is incorrect. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are categorized as having the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels globally, according to the GHI 2023. This highlights the significant food security challenges facing these regions.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI uses four key indicators—undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality—to assess the severity of hunger in different countries.  These indicators provide a comprehensive picture of nutritional status and child health.

3. The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four languages, with at least two being Indian languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCF-SE indeed proposes a restructuring of the school education system into a 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups, aiming for a more holistic and integrated approach to learning.  This is a significant departure from the previous four-stage system.

Statement 2 is also correct. The NCF-SE emphasizes breaking down traditional barriers between academic and vocational streams at the secondary level. This allows for greater flexibility and choice in students' educational paths, aligning with the broader goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly promotes multilingualism and the use of Indian languages, it specifies proficiency in at least *three* languages, not four, with at least two being Indian languages.  The inclusion of a fourth language is not a mandatory requirement of the framework.  This makes statement 3 factually inaccurate.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act specifically excludes those who use appropriate protective gear and equipment from the definition of manual scavengers.  The use of tools and protective measures is a crucial distinction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act places the responsibility for identifying manual scavengers and providing rehabilitation support squarely on local authorities (municipalities, panchayats, etc.).

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act does not specify a 1-year timeframe for the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines.  The timeframe is not explicitly defined in the act itself.  It's a phased approach.


**9. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates the constitution of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every establishment with 10 or more employees.
2.  The ICC has powers similar to those of a civil court, including the power to summon witnesses and compel production of documents.
3.  The Act allows for monetary settlements to be made as part of the conciliation process in cases of sexual harassment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act makes it mandatory for establishments with 10 or more employees to set up an ICC to address complaints of sexual harassment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ICC has significant investigative powers, it does not possess powers equivalent to a civil court.  It cannot summon witnesses or compel the production of documents in the same way a court can.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation in sexual harassment cases.  This is to ensure that victims are not pressured into accepting inadequate compensation.


**10. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1.  NFHS-5 data was collected in 2020-21, covering a wide range of health indicators for women and children.

2. Single women (widows or divorcees) seeking surrogacy are permitted to use only their own eggs and donor sperm.
3. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child, is explicitly legalized under these rules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amended rules introduce a condition for surrogacy involving donor gametes, stipulating that the child must possess at least one gamete from the intending couple. This clarifies and restricts the previously prohibited use of donor gametes under Rule 7 of the 2022 Surrogacy Rules.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The rules specifically address the situation of single women undergoing surrogacy, mandating the use of their own eggs and donor sperm. This reflects a specific regulatory approach to a particular scenario within the broader context of surrogacy. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and subsequent amendments primarily focus on altruistic gestational surrogacy, explicitly prohibiting commercial surrogacy. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically linked to the child, is not legalized under the current framework.  The focus remains on ensuring the intending couple's genetic connection to the child, aligning with ethical considerations and preventing exploitation.


**2. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act allows termination of pregnancy up to 28 weeks for all women based on the advice of two doctors.
2.  The Act permits abortion beyond 24 weeks only in cases of severe fetal abnormalities, requiring the opinion of a medical board.
3.  The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried women, but not to minors.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MTP Act, as amended in 2021, expanded access to abortion, the 28-week limit is not universally applicable. The timeframe varies depending on the specific circumstances of the pregnancy and requires the opinion of one or two doctors.  Statement 2 is correct.  The MTP Act allows for abortion beyond 24 weeks only under specific and exceptional circumstances, primarily involving severe fetal abnormalities.  This requires a medical board's assessment, underscoring the stringent conditions attached to late-term abortions. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling did extend the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried women, and critically, this extension also included minors. The ruling aimed to broaden access to safe abortion services, recognizing the reproductive rights of all women regardless of marital status or age.


**3. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse inflicted by a husband on his wife.
2.  A complaint under the PWDVA can be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself and not by a Protection Officer or any other person on her behalf.
3.  Reliefs under the PWDVA are exclusive and cannot be sought concurrently with other legal proceedings such as those related to divorce or maintenance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA offers a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing not only physical abuse but also verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse.  It extends beyond the confines of a husband-wife relationship, encompassing various forms of domestic relationships. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PWDVA explicitly allows for complaints to be filed not only by the aggrieved woman but also by a Protection Officer or any other person acting on her behalf.  This provision recognizes that victims might need support in navigating the legal process. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PWDVA does not preclude seeking reliefs concurrently with other legal proceedings.  In fact, it explicitly allows for this, recognizing that domestic violence often overlaps with other legal issues like divorce or maintenance.  The act’s provisions are supplemental, allowing for a holistic approach to addressing the victim's needs.


**4. With reference to child trafficking in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily addresses child trafficking for forced labor and organ trade.
2.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, specifically criminalizes the sexual exploitation of children.
3.  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012, provides a comprehensive legal framework to combat child trafficking in all its forms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, deals with aspects of sexual exploitation, its primary focus is on the prevention and suppression of immoral trafficking, not specifically child trafficking for forced labor or organ trade.  Other laws directly address these issues. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, focuses on abolishing bonded labor, primarily addressing economic exploitation.  It does not specifically criminalize the sexual exploitation of children; that falls under other legislation. Statement 3 is correct.  The POCSO Act, 2012, provides a robust legal framework specifically designed to protect children from sexual offenses, including those related to trafficking for sexual exploitation.  It addresses various forms of sexual abuse and exploitation and outlines mechanisms for prosecution and child protection.


**5. With reference to the  Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons only in employment and education.
2. The Act mandates the issuance of a certificate of identity based solely on the self-perceived gender identity of the transgender person.
3.  The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the central government on policies and programs related to transgender rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, prohibits discrimination against transgender individuals across a broader spectrum of areas, including employment, education, housing, healthcare, and access to other services.  The act aims to ensure equal opportunities and non-discrimination in various facets of life. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act allows for self-perceived gender identity to be a significant factor, the issuance of a certificate of identity involves a more formal process, including verification by a district magistrate. It isn't solely based on self-declaration. Statement 3 is correct. The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons, providing a crucial mechanism for advising the central government on the development and implementation of appropriate policies and programs for the transgender community, ensuring their rights and welfare are addressed effectively.


**6. With reference to the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF is primarily focused on promoting research and innovation in the humanities and social sciences, excluding STEM fields.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) will serve as the administrative department for the NRF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRF Act, 2023, has a broad mandate encompassing research and innovation across various disciplines, including natural sciences (STEM fields), engineering, technology, environmental sciences, health, agriculture, and the scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences.  It's not limited to humanities and social sciences alone. Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister of India holds the ex-officio position of President on the Governing Board of the NRF, reflecting the high-level importance attached to the Foundation and its role in national scientific and technological advancement. Statement 3 is correct. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) is designated as the administrative department for the NRF, providing the necessary administrative and logistical support for the Foundation's operations and functions.


**7. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCF-SE retains the existing four-stage structure of school education (Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary).
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must take board examinations at the end of Grades 10 and 12, with no provision for multiple attempts.
3.  The NCF-SE promotes multilingualism, encouraging proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCF-SE introduces a revised 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for school education, replacing the existing four-stage system. This reflects a shift in pedagogical approach and aims to align with the overall goals of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE allows for students to take board examinations on at least two occasions during a school year, retaining only the best score. This offers flexibility and reduces the pressure of a single high-stakes exam. Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE strongly advocates for multilingualism, aiming to enhance students' proficiency in at least three languages, prioritizing the inclusion of at least two Indian languages. This promotes linguistic diversity and strengthens students' connection to their cultural heritage.


**8. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs is based solely on the National Achievement Survey (NAS) data.
2.  The PGI-D combined report for 2020-21 & 2021-22 assesses school performance based solely on the number of students enrolled.
3. In the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22, several states achieved the highest grade (Daksh).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs utilizes data from multiple sources, including the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.  A holistic assessment requires considering various indicators. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGI-D report considers a wider range of factors in evaluating school performance, including outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety, not just student enrollment. A comprehensive evaluation necessitates a multifaceted approach. Statement 3 is incorrect. In the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22, no state or UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh).  This highlights the need for continued improvement in the school education system across the country.


**9. With reference to the  National Medical Commission (NMC) and its recent developments, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMC is a non-statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019.
2.  The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) recognition for the NMC ensures that all existing and new medical colleges in India will automatically receive WFME accreditation for the next 20 years.
3.  The NMC is solely responsible for overseeing the quality of medical education in India, without any involvement of other regulatory agencies at the state level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMC is a statutory body, established under the NMC Act, 2019. Its legal status is crucial for its regulatory powers and functions within the medical education and practice domain. Statement 2 is incorrect. While WFME recognition provides significant benefits, the duration of automatic accreditation for existing and new medical colleges is 10 years, not 20. The timeframe reflects a balance between ensuring quality standards and allowing for periodic reviews and adjustments. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NMC plays a central role, other regulatory agencies at the state level also contribute to overseeing medical education. A multi-layered system is often in place to ensure comprehensive quality control and address the diverse needs of different regions and institutions.


**10. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) and its implications, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI primarily focuses on measuring the prevalence of undernourishment in a country.
2.  India's GHI score has consistently improved over the past decade, indicating significant progress in addressing hunger.
3. The GHI considers only quantitative data related to food availability and production, without factoring in qualitative aspects like food access and utilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GHI is a composite index that assesses multiple dimensions of hunger, but its primary focus is on measuring the prevalence of undernourishment—the proportion of the population that is undernourished. This is a key indicator of a country's food security situation. Statement 2 is incorrect. India's GHI score has not consistently improved over the past decade. It has fluctuated, and in recent years, there have been concerns about the country's performance in reducing hunger and undernourishment. Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI incorporates both quantitative and qualitative factors to provide a comprehensive measure of hunger.  It considers data on undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality, reflecting different aspects of food security.  It goes beyond merely looking at food availability and production.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharia PVTG in Madhya Pradesh and the Kamar and Baiga tribes in Chhattisgarh were recently granted Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, exceeding all other states.
3.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions the granting of Habitat Rights to the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. Statement 3 is also correct; the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry for tribal welfare, as clearly stated in the provided text.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does house a significant number (13) of PVTGs, the text explicitly states that Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in absolute numbers.  This does not directly translate to the highest number of PVTGs, as PVTGs are a subset of STs.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are definitively correct based on the provided information.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
2.  All nomadic tribes are classified as Denotified Tribes, but not all Denotified Tribes are nomadic.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. Statement 3 is also correct, as the text specifies that August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that "All nomadic tribes (NTs) are not DNTs, but all DNTs are NTs," indicating that DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes, not the other way around. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, encompassing intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RPwD Act does mandate a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions, it specifically excludes police forces from this reservation policy.  Statement 2 is correct; the act does recognize 21 types of disabilities, including those mentioned. Statement 3 is also correct, as the text clearly indicates that the Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prescribes a maximum punishment of imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine of up to Rs. Two Lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines and ensure they are functional and hygienic.
3.  Safal karamcharis, who work as sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities or government organizations, are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The punishment under PEMSR is imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, not 5 years and Rs. Two Lakh as stated. Statement 2 is correct; the act does mandate the construction and maintenance of sanitary latrines. Statement 3 is incorrect. Safal karamcharis are explicitly *included* in the definition of manual scavengers if they handle undecomposed human waste without proper protective gear. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with no exceptions for heinous offenses.
2.  The JJ Act, 2015, originally stipulated that adoption of a child is finalized only after a civil court issues an adoption order.
3. The National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) issued guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offenses under the JJ Act, 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2015 Act *did* include a provision allowing children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for heinous offenses.  Statement 2 is correct; the original Act did require a civil court order for adoption finalization. Statement 3 is also correct; the NCPCR did issue such guidelines.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate according to the provided text.


**6.  With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women, regardless of the circumstances, upon the advice of one doctor.
2.  The Supreme Court, in 2022, ruled that for the sole purpose of the MTP Act, the meaning of rape must include marital rape.
3.  Only countries like the US, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Poland have rolled back the legality of abortion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows termination up to 24 weeks only under specific circumstances (rape, incest, etc.) requiring the advice of two doctors in certain cases, not one doctor for all women. Statement 2 is correct; the Supreme Court did make this ruling. Statement 3 is also correct, although it's a simplification of a complex global situation, the core assertion about those four countries is accurate.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct based on the provided information.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005:**

1.  The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence to include only physical, verbal, and emotional abuse, excluding economic and sexual abuse.
2.  A complaint under the PWDVA can be filed only against the husband of the aggrieved woman.
3.  The PWDVA provides for civil remedies for marital rape but does not allow criminal proceedings against the perpetrator.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA defines domestic violence far more broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Complaints can be filed against a wider range of individuals, including relatives of the husband or male partner. Statement 3 is correct; the act focuses on civil remedies, not criminal ones, for marital rape.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCRF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCRF seeks to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, but excludes experiential learning.
2.  The NCRF divides education into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 referring to school education and levels 4.5-8 referring to higher education.  Vocational education and training are not integrated into this framework.
3.  The NCRF employs the concept of "Notional Learning Hours," fixing the total for school, college, vocational, and skill education at 1200 hours/year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCRF explicitly *includes* experiential learning in its credit integration system. Statement 2 is incorrect. Vocational education and training are explicitly integrated into the 8-level framework described. Statement 3 is correct; the concept of Notional Learning Hours and the specified number of hours are mentioned in the provided text. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India:**

1.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisions a single accreditation body for HEIs, replacing the existing multiple agencies.
2.  The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited) for HEIs, eliminating the graded system.
3.  The National Accreditation Council (NAC), as envisioned in NEP 2020, will function as a meta-accrediting body, overseeing other accrediting institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NEP 2020 aims to streamline the system, it doesn't propose a *single* accreditation body but rather a more organized structure with the NAC as an overseer. Statement 2 is correct; the committee did recommend a binary system. Statement 3 is also correct; the NAC's role as a meta-accrediting body is mentioned.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**10. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1.  NFHS-5 found that the percentage of spousal abuse was highest in Bihar, followed by Karnataka, Manipur, and Telangana.
2.  NFHS-5 reported that 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 years have experienced spousal violence (physical and/or sexual).
3.  NFHS-5 is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that Karnataka had the highest percentage of spousal abuse, followed by Bihar, Manipur, and Telangana.  Statement 2 is correct; the percentage of spousal violence reported is accurate. The implementing agency for NFHS-5 is not explicitly stated in the given text, making statement 3 unverifiable from this source.  Therefore, only statement 2 is definitively correct.




**1. With reference to the provisions of the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every organization with at least 50 employees.
2.  A complaint under the POSH Act must be filed within six months of the incident, with no provision for extension.
3.  The ICC can recommend monetary settlements as a means of conciliation between the aggrieved woman and the respondent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  The POSH Act mandates an ICC in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 50.  The Act allows for the ICC to extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond three months,  and explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation.  The Act aims to provide a redressal mechanism that prioritizes justice and accountability over financial compensation in such sensitive matters. The emphasis is on preventing and prohibiting sexual harassment and ensuring a safe working environment for women.


**2. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits commercial surrogacy, allowing for monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses.
2.  The amended rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
3.  Single women are prohibited from availing surrogacy procedures under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy.  The amended rules permit surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical conditions, provided at least one gamete is from the intending couple.  Single women (widows or divorcees) are allowed to undergo surrogacy using their own eggs and donor sperm,  contradicting statement 3.


**3. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its amendments, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 17 years of age.
2.  The 2021 amendment removed the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults for heinous offences.
3.  Adoption orders issued under the Act are subject to appeal before the High Court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are accurate. The Act defines a 'child' as a person below 18 years of age. The 2021 amendment *retained* the provision for trying children aged 16-18 as adults in certain heinous offences, subject to assessment by the Juvenile Justice Board. Appeals regarding adoption orders under the Act are made to the Divisional Commissioner, not the High Court. The amendments aimed to balance the rights of the child with the need for justice in serious crimes while streamlining the adoption process.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits the employment of individuals to clean human waste if appropriate protective gear is used.
2.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within one year of its enactment.
3. The Act provides for rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance, but not property assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The PEMSR Act does allow cleaning of human waste if appropriate protective gear and equipment are used,  making it a crucial exception to the ban on manual scavenging. However, the Act doesn't mandate the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe; it sets a phased approach for their conversion or demolition.  While the Act does provide for rehabilitation through alternative employment and financial help, it also includes provisions for assistance in property acquisition, making statement 3 incorrect. The Act focuses on eliminating the practice while ensuring the welfare of those previously engaged in it.


**5. With reference to the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy recognizes menstruation as a natural bodily process, but only for women of reproductive age.
2. The policy prioritizes access to menstrual hygiene resources for underserved populations.
3.  The policy mandates paid menstrual leave for all working women in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, explicitly recognizes menstruation as a natural bodily process for all who menstruate, including girls and women of all ages, thus making statement 1 incorrect.  The policy prioritizes equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources for underserved and vulnerable populations.  The policy does *not* mandate paid menstrual leave; while some countries like Spain offer this, it is not a feature of the Indian policy.


**6.  With reference to the measures undertaken for Tribal Welfare in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2.  The Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are identified based solely on their pre-agricultural level of technology.
3.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry for ST welfare. Odisha does have the highest number of PVTGs.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. While a pre-agricultural level of technology is a criterion, the identification of PVTGs also considers factors like low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  The multifaceted nature of the criteria reflects the complexity of identifying and addressing the vulnerabilities of these groups.


**7. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government jobs, including police forces.
2. The Act defines "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability.
3.  The Act establishes a special court in each district exclusively for cases under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities; this reservation does *not* apply to police forces. The Act correctly defines "person with benchmark disability" as having at least 40% of a specified disability.  While the Act aims for faster adjudication of cases, it doesn't mandate a separate, exclusive court in each district for cases under the Act.  The focus is on ensuring rights and access, but the judicial process isn't restructured to this extent.


**8. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  According to the 2011 Census, Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of working children in India.
2.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 18 years of age in all employment.
3. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The 2011 Census data indicates that Uttar Pradesh had the highest number of working children. Statement 2 is incorrect; the 2016 Act prohibits employment of children below 14 years in all employment and employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NCLP scheme falls under the Ministry of Labour and Employment. The complexities of child labour necessitate a multi-pronged approach involving various ministries and agencies.


**9.  With reference to the adoption process in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs the adoption of children of all religions in India.
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, governs only inter-country adoptions.
3. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is a statutory body responsible for overseeing all aspects of adoption in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. CARA is the statutory body overseeing adoption. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, applies only to Hindus and those following related religions. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the JJ Act governs both inter-country and intra-country adoptions of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children. The legal framework for adoption in India is complex and involves multiple laws and agencies to ensure the child's best interests.


**10. With reference to the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.
2. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, which categorized certain communities as "criminal," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952.
3.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to prepare a national-level list of castes belonging to DNTs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952. Statement 1 is incorrect; not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NCDNT prepares state-wise lists, not a national-level list.  The history and current situation of DNTs highlight the complexities of social categorization and the ongoing efforts to address their historical disadvantages.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 primarily addresses the issue of child trafficking for commercial sex purposes.
2. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 specifically targets the exploitation of children through forced labor in hazardous industries.
3. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 includes provisions to prevent the illegal organ trade involving children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 aims to curb immoral trafficking and sex work, its focus is broader than just child trafficking.  It addresses exploitation of women and girls in various forms of sexual exploitation.  Statement 2 is also partially incorrect. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 targets the broader issue of bonded labour, encompassing various forms of economic and physical exploitation, not solely focused on children or hazardous industries.  Statement 3 is correct. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 criminalizes commercial organ trade, which often involves vulnerable populations, including children.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects a law directly addressing child exploitation in a specific context. The other acts have wider scopes, making options (a), (b), and (c) incorrect.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1. The POCSO Act, 2012 defines a child as anyone below the age of 18, aligning with the international definition of a child as per the ILO.
2.  The amendment to Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code in 2013, following the POCSO Act, raised the age of consent to 18, eliminating all exceptions for marital rape.
3. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, while raising the age of consent for married women to 18 in its definition of rape, retains a marital rape exception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The POCSO Act, 2012, indeed defines a child as anyone below 18 years, consistent with the ILO's definition for hazardous work. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 2013 amendment to Section 375 of the IPC raised the age of consent to 18, it did *not* eliminate all exceptions for marital rape. An exception for marital rape involving wives not under the age of 15 remained.  Statement 3 is correct. The BNS, 2023, increased the age of consent for married women to 18 in its definition of rape, but a marital rape exception persists.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate, making option (b) the correct choice.


**3. With reference to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates a certificate of identity based on self-perception of gender identity, issued by a district magistrate, for recognition as a transgender person.
2. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons only in employment and education.
3.  The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons solely to advise the central government on legislative matters concerning transgender rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act does allow for self-perception of gender identity but requires a certificate issued by the district magistrate for legal recognition. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in a broader range of areas than just employment and education. It extends to housing, healthcare, and other services. Statement 3 is incorrect. The National Council for Transgender Persons has a wider mandate than just advising on legislation.  It advises the central government on policies, programs, legislation, and projects related to transgender persons. Thus, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option. The other options include inaccurate or incomplete descriptions of the Act's provisions.


**4. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines domestic violence solely as physical and sexual abuse within a marital relationship.
2.  The Act allows for complaints to be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself.
3. The Act provides for civil remedies but does not allow for criminal proceedings related to marital rape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence more broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. It's not limited to marital relationships; it covers various domestic relationships. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows for complaints to be filed by the aggrieved woman, a protection officer, or any other person on her behalf.  Statement 3 is correct.  The PWDVA primarily provides for civil remedies. While marital rape is a form of domestic violence covered under the act, the act itself doesn't initiate criminal proceedings for it.  Since none of the statements are entirely correct, the answer is (a).


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1. The Act defines manual scavengers solely as individuals employed to clean human waste from insanitary latrines without protective gear.
2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, irrespective of existing infrastructure or feasibility.
3. The Act's rehabilitation provisions exclusively focus on providing financial assistance to manual scavengers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, encompassing individuals employed to handle human waste from various sources, not solely insanitary latrines.  The use of protective gear is an exception, not the defining factor. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, but it doesn't mandate their immediate demolition in all cases. It considers practical factors and the availability of alternative sanitation solutions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act's rehabilitation plan includes training for alternative employment, financial aid, and assistance with property acquisition, not solely financial assistance. Therefore, none of the statements are completely accurate, leading to the correct answer (d).


**6. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy with any monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses.
2. The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) with the primary function of regulating surrogacy clinics.
3. The Act mandates the abortion of a surrogate child requires only the written consent of the intending couple.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act explicitly permits only altruistic surrogacy, making commercial surrogacy illegal. Statement 2 is largely correct. While NARTSB's functions extend beyond simply regulating clinics, it plays a crucial role in overseeing and monitoring the implementation of the Act. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act requires written consent from both the surrogate mother and authorization from the appropriate authority, compliant with the MTP Act, 1971, for the abortion of a surrogate child.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are substantially accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following statements about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. The NCF-SE advocates for a rigid, subject-specific approach to school education, minimizing interdisciplinary learning.
2. The NCF-SE emphasizes rote learning of scientific theories and laws, neglecting the development of scientific inquiry skills.
3. The NCF-SE integrates environmental education as a separate subject of study at the primary stage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCF-SE promotes a holistic, integrated approach to learning, encouraging interdisciplinary connections and reducing rigid subject boundaries. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE strongly emphasizes the development of scientific inquiry skills and critical thinking, not just rote memorization. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE integrates environmental education at all stages, it culminates in a separate area of study at the secondary stage, not the primary stage.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the NCF-SE's core principles, making (a) the correct answer.



**8. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF aims to create separate, independent credit systems for school education, higher education, and vocational training, preventing seamless integration.
2.  The NCrF utilizes the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) to store credits earned through various forms of learning, including experiential learning.
3. The NCrF restricts multiple entry and exit options in the educational system, promoting a linear progression through educational levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF's core objective is to integrate credits earned from various educational pathways, creating a unified credit system. Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF leverages the ABC to store credits from academic, vocational, and experiential learning, fostering flexibility and mobility. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly promotes multiple entry and exit points, allowing for flexible and personalized learning pathways. Thus, only statement 2 accurately reflects the NCrF's features and goals, making (a) the correct option.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the  "Temple of Healing v. Union of India" Supreme Court judgment:**

1. The judgment mandates the immediate transfer of all children residing in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) to adoptive families, regardless of parental circumstances.
2.  The judgment directs states to conduct monthly drives to identify children in the Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered (OAS) category within CCIs and register them on the CARINGS portal.
3. The judgment defines "unfit" parents or guardians solely as those with a criminal record or history of substance abuse, excluding other forms of neglect or abuse.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment doesn't mandate immediate transfer of *all* children but calls for identifying those with absent or unfit parents for a year or more and prioritising them for adoption. Statement 2 is largely correct. The judgment does direct states to conduct bi-monthly (not monthly) drives to identify OAS children in CCIs and register them on the CARINGS portal. Statement 3 is incorrect. The judgment defines "unfit" parents more broadly, including those who neglect or abuse children, have substance abuse issues, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to provide proper care. Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications of the judgment's directives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs, it is not the highest.  The text states Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, but it doesn't claim this to be the highest number in India.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs as outlined in the provided text.  Statement 3 is correct; the Bharia tribe is explicitly mentioned as being listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that all nomadic tribes are not DNTs, but all DNTs are nomadic tribes, reversing the relationship. Statement 2 is correct: The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act.  Statement 3 is also correct; the text explicitly mentions August 31st as Vimukta Jatis Day for DNT communities.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the RPwD Act does mandate reservations for PwDs in higher education and government jobs, it specifically excludes police forces from this reservation policy. Statement 2 is correct; the Act does recognize 21 types of disabilities as mentioned. Statement 3 is also correct; the establishment of special courts in each district is a provision of the Act. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  The government of India renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as PVTGs in 2006, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, houses the highest number of PVTGs in India (13).  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes,  Odisha holds the distinction for the highest number of PVTGs.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall ST population and the specific PVTG categorization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs explicitly include a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, significant economic backwardness, and a population that is either stagnant or declining. These factors point to a high degree of vulnerability within the tribal communities.

Statement 3 is correct. The government of India officially changed the designation from PTGs to PVTGs in 2006, following the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission, which initially identified these groups in 1961.  The change in terminology reflects a shift in focus towards emphasizing the vulnerability of these groups.



**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  The statement incorrectly reverses this crucial distinction.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a deeply discriminatory piece of legislation, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  However, the legacy of this act continues to affect the social and economic conditions of many DNT communities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Renke Commission's report estimated a population of around 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic communities. This highlights the significant size and vulnerability of these populations.



**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs, excluding police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including those caused by acid attacks.
3.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18 in either neighborhood schools or special schools of their choice.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, falls under the MoWCD and receives central government funding.  This reflects its national importance in addressing child development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improving the nutritional status of children (0-6 years) is a primary goal of Saksham Anganwadi, it also expands its scope to include adolescent girls (14-18 years), particularly in aspirational districts and the North Eastern Region, and focuses on Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE). The statement inaccurately limits the scope of Saksham Anganwadi's objectives.

Statement 3 is correct. AWWs and AWHs benefit from social security schemes including PMJJBY, PMSBY, and AKBY. This provides them with crucial insurance coverage and financial security.

2.  The primary objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, while simultaneously reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.
3. Anganwadi workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the state governments, along with performance-linked incentives based on the utilization of ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the MoWCD, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0.  The scheme's restructuring aims to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.

Statement 2 is also correct. Improving the nutritional and health status of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reducing mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition are the core objectives of the Anganwadi Services Scheme.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium,  the statement is misleading in claiming it's solely decided by state governments. The central government also plays a role in determining the honorarium, and many states provide additional honorarium from their own resources. The performance-linked incentive mentioned is accurate, but the statement's phrasing is imprecise and potentially confusing.


**2. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 2017, POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting in districts with the highest malnutrition burden by improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services and ensuring holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.
2. The NNM operates independently of other ministries, solely focusing on nutrition-related interventions.
3. POSHAN Abhiyan's success is solely measured by the reduction in stunting rates across all districts in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. POSHAN Abhiyan was indeed launched in 2017 with the goals of reducing stunting, improving Anganwadi service utilization, and ensuring holistic nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NNM doesn't operate in isolation. It actively monitors, supervises, sets targets, and guides nutrition-related interventions across multiple ministries, coordinating efforts for a more comprehensive approach to nutrition.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While reducing stunting is a major goal, POSHAN Abhiyan's success isn't solely based on this one metric. It considers a broader range of indicators related to nutritional status and overall development of the target groups. The focus is on identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden, not all districts.

1. The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, indicates that South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have the highest hunger levels globally, each with a GHI score of 27.0.
2. India's 2023 GHI score shows a significant improvement compared to its 2015 score, indicating a substantial reduction in hunger levels.
3. The Indian government's objections to the GHI are primarily based on concerns about the methodology, sample size, and data sources used in the index's calculation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The GHI 2023 report from Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe does indeed highlight South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the highest hunger levels.  However, the GHI scores presented in the statement are not precisely accurate; the actual scores may vary slightly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did improve slightly from 2015 to 2023, the statement exaggerates the degree of improvement. The improvement is minimal and does not represent a substantial reduction in hunger levels.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian government's objections to the GHI are well-documented and center on concerns about the index's methodology, sample size limitations, and the reliability of the data sources used.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the  "Triple Threat Report" released by UNICEF:**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the definition of the "triple threat" as outlined in UNICEF's report. It combines the factors of inadequate WASH access, high child mortality from unsafe WASH conditions, and vulnerability to climate and environmental hazards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report's focus is not limited to high-income countries. It examines the "triple threat" across a range of countries, including low- and middle-income nations that bear a disproportionate burden of WASH-related challenges.

Statement 3 is correct. The report does indeed identify India among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of WASH-related deaths in children under 5, highlighting the severity of the issue in the country.


**5. With reference to the  World Health Organization (WHO) report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH services, consider the following statements:**

1. The report concludes that in 2019, access to safe WASH services could have prevented 2.5% of all deaths globally.
2. The report primarily focuses on the impact of unsafe WASH services on adult populations.
3. The report emphasizes the link between inadequate WASH services in health facilities and high neonatal mortality rates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects a key finding of the WHO report. The report estimated that improved access to safe WASH services could have significantly reduced global mortality in 2019, though the exact percentage may be subject to slight variations depending on the interpretation of the data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the report addresses the broader impact of unsafe WASH, it doesn't primarily focus on adult populations. It highlights the devastating effects on all age groups, particularly vulnerable populations like children and infants.

Statement 3 is correct. The WHO report explicitly connects inadequate WASH in healthcare settings to increased neonatal mortality, emphasizing the critical role of hygiene and sanitation in reducing infant deaths.


**6. With reference to the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) India Ageing Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report projects that India's population will surpass China's by mid-2023, making India the world's most populous country.
2. The report indicates that India has one of the oldest populations globally, with a large percentage of its population over the age of 65.
3. The report highlights a declining fertility rate in India, with the total fertility rate currently standing at 2.0.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UNFPA report accurately predicted that India's population would exceed China's by mid-2023, solidifying its position as the world's most populous nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report actually highlights that India has a relatively young population, with a significant portion in the working-age group.  The percentage of the population over 65 is considerably lower than what is implied in the statement.  The statement misrepresents the age demographic.

Statement 3 is correct. The report does indeed show a decreasing fertility rate in India, with the total fertility rate currently at or around 2.0, indicating a significant shift in demographic trends.


**7. With reference to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates that progress on more than half of the SDG targets is weak, with progress on some targets having stalled or reversed.
2. The report attributes the lack of progress primarily to insufficient funding allocated to sustainable development initiatives.
3. The report highlights the lasting negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the interconnected crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UNDESA report clearly shows that progress towards achieving many of the SDGs is lagging, with a significant portion of targets showing weak progress, stagnation, or even reversals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While funding is a factor, the report doesn't solely attribute the lack of progress to insufficient funding. It points to a complex interplay of factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical instability, and the escalating climate crisis.

Statement 3 is correct. The report explicitly links the slow progress on the SDGs to the lasting negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the interconnected global challenges of climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution.  These are presented as major obstacles to achieving the goals.


**8. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

2. The Act mandates the construction of new insanitary latrines to improve sanitation infrastructure.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial assistance, and help in acquiring property.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers.  It explicitly includes anyone employed to handle human excreta from insanitary facilities, irrespective of whether they are employed on a regular or contractual basis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PEMSR Act, in fact, aims to *eliminate* insanitary latrines, not construct new ones. Its focus is on demolishing insanitary latrines and converting them into sanitary ones, thereby preventing the need for manual scavenging.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and support in acquiring property to help them transition to a better life.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the core objectives of the ABDM.  It's designed to enhance access to quality healthcare through digital technologies, including telemedicine, and to ensure the seamless portability of health records across the country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ABDM includes both public and private hospitals and digital solution companies in its efforts to create a comprehensive digital health ecosystem.  It's not limited to public sector institutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the government is a primary driver of the ABDM, it encourages participation from the private sector to leverage their expertise and resources in building the digital health infrastructure.  It's not solely reliant on government funding.



**1. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), consider the following statements:**

1. IFPRI, established in 1971, is a primary research center under the CGIAR.
2. IFPRI's headquarters are located in Rome, Italy, and it operates across 50 countries.
3. IFPRI primarily focuses on providing research-based policy solutions to mitigate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IFPRI was established in 1975, not 1971. The Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) was established in 1971, but IFPRI joined later.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While IFPRI does work in over 60 countries, including India, its headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Rome, Italy.  Statement 3 is correct. IFPRI's core mission centers around using research to inform policy decisions aimed at reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition globally.

1. UNHCR was established in 1955 by the UN General Assembly, with its headquarters in New York City.
2. The 1967 Protocol to the 1951 Refugee Convention is a key legal document guiding UNHCR's operations, extending its mandate beyond European refugees.
3. UNHCR primarily operates in high-income countries, assisting refugees with resettlement and integration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City. Statement 2 is correct. The 1967 Protocol significantly broadened the scope of the 1951 Refugee Convention, removing geographical limitations and allowing UNHCR to assist refugees globally.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  UNHCR's work is heavily concentrated in low- and middle-income countries, which host the vast majority of the world’s refugees. High-income countries often play a role in resettlement, but the primary burden of refugee hosting falls on developing nations.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI, established in 1998, is headquartered in London, UK, and comprises 150 national human rights institutions.
2. GANHRI's primary function is to review and accredit National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
3. The GANHRI accreditation process for the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India has been consistently delayed due to concerns regarding political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1998, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not London, UK. The number of member institutions is also not precisely 150; it's around 120. Statement 2 is also incorrect. GANHRI uses the Paris Principles (adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly), not the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as the standard for reviewing and accrediting NHRIs.  Statement 3 is correct. The GANHRI accreditation of the NHRC has indeed faced delays due to concerns about political influence on appointments, involvement of police in human rights investigations, and insufficient engagement with civil society organizations.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

1. UNPFII, established in 2005 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly, is a subsidiary body of the UN Human Rights Council.
2. UNPFII comprises 18 independent experts—eight nominated by governments and ten by indigenous organizations—who serve three-year terms.
3. UNPFII's mandate includes addressing indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UNPFII was established in 2000, not 2005, by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN Human Rights Council.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While UNPFII does have 16 independent experts serving three-year terms, the composition is eight nominated by governments and eight by indigenous organizations, not ten by indigenous organizations.  Statement 3 is correct. UNPFII's mandate broadly covers the economic, social, cultural, environmental, educational, health, and human rights aspects of indigenous issues.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely accurate, although statement 2 contains a minor inaccuracy.

1. The NIF, developed in 2017, aligns exclusively with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) indicators.
2. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and disseminating the NIF and its progress reports.
3. The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs, in addition to those aligned with global SDG indicators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NIF does align with the GIF, it also includes indicators specific to India's context and requirements, going beyond a direct replication of the GIF. Statement 2 is correct. MoSPI is the nodal ministry responsible for developing, implementing, and reporting on the NIF and its progress. Statement 3 is correct. The NIF incorporates both global SDG indicators and those specifically relevant to India's unique development challenges and priorities, making it a more comprehensive framework for monitoring progress. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the  Caste Census, consider the following statements:**

1. The Caste Census is a state subject under the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution of India.
2. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011 data, including caste-based data, was fully published in 2016.
3. Post-independence, the Government of India has consistently collected and published detailed caste-based data for the entire population, except for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) None
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Census is a Union subject (Entry 69 of the Union List) under Article 246 of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SECC 2011 data, excluding caste data, was finalized and published in 2016. The caste data from SECC 2011 remains unpublished. Statement 3 is incorrect.  After independence, the Government of India largely abandoned full caste enumeration, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs), with some exceptions like the 1941 census data which was collected but not published.  Therefore, all three statements are factually inaccurate.

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the complete elimination of manual scavenging by 2020.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle any decomposed human waste, irrespective of the tools or equipment used.
3. The Act provides for rehabilitation measures such as alternative employment training and financial assistance for manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act doesn't set a specific deadline of 2020 for the complete elimination of manual scavenging; the goal is its eventual eradication, but no specific timeframe was legally mandated. Statement 2 is incorrect. The act specifically excludes those using appropriate protective gear from the definition of manual scavengers.  Statement 3 is correct. The Act does include provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial aid, and property acquisition support. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs receive both a fixed monthly honorarium and performance-linked incentives. Statement 3 is correct. The primary beneficiaries of the Anganwadi system are indeed children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.


**10. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs), consider the following statements:**

**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed as Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  The primary objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and to reduce mortality and morbidity rates among these groups.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium determined by the state governments, with no additional incentives offered by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi system is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), now operating under the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 initiative.

Statement 2 is also correct. The stated objectives accurately reflect the core aims of the Anganwadi Services Scheme: improving the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, while simultaneously striving to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, the central government *does* provide additional performance-linked incentives.  The text specifically mentions a ₹500 per month incentive for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan.  Many states also provide additional honorariums from their own resources, but the presence of a central incentive makes statement 3 factually inaccurate.



**2. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  POSHAN Abhiyan was launched in 2018 with the primary goal of reducing child mortality rates in India.
2.  The mission focuses solely on providing nutritional supplements to pregnant women and children under five years of age.
3.  The POSHAN Abhiyan utilizes the Anganwadi system as a crucial component for service delivery and monitoring.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. POSHAN Abhiyan was launched in 2017, not 2018. Its primary aim is to reduce malnutrition, with a specific focus on stunting, but not solely child mortality.  While reduced mortality is a positive outcome, it's not the stated primary goal.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The mission's scope is broader than just nutritional supplements. It aims for holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children, incorporating various interventions beyond just supplements.

Statement 3 is correct. POSHAN Abhiyan leverages the existing Anganwadi infrastructure and workers for service delivery and monitoring of its programs.  The Anganwadi system is integral to the mission's success.



**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023 report, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, ranked India in the 'serious' category, indicating a significant improvement from its 2015 ranking.

3.  The Indian government has consistently endorsed the methodology and data sources used in the GHI reports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India was indeed ranked in the 'serious' category, the text states that the improvement from 2015 was *slight*, not significant. The wording is crucial here; a slight improvement is different from significant progress.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI score is calculated based on the four indicators mentioned: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian government has *raised objections* to the GHI methodology, citing issues with sample size and data sources.  This directly contradicts the statement.


**4. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana primarily focuses on providing tertiary-level healthcare services.
2.  The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) aims to improve equitable access to quality healthcare through technology, including telemedicine.
3.  The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve UHC but does not specify affordability as a key dimension.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to holistically address health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not focusing solely on tertiary care.

Statement 2 is correct. The ABDM explicitly utilizes technology, including telemedicine, to improve equitable access to quality healthcare.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that accessibility, affordability, and quality are key dimensions of UHC as envisioned by the National Health Policy 2017.

1. The NCF-SE, 2023 recommends a significant restructuring of school education, emphasizing holistic development.
2.  The NCF-SE advocates for a rigid, subject-specific curriculum with minimal flexibility for schools.
3. The NCF-SE promotes the integration of arts, humanities, and sports into the curriculum.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), 2023, indeed proposes a major overhaul of the Indian school education system.  Statement 1 is accurate; it aims for a holistic approach to learning, going beyond rote memorization and focusing on the overall development of the child. Statement 3 is also correct, as the NCF-SE actively promotes the integration of various disciplines, including arts, humanities, and sports, to foster well-rounded individuals.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the framework emphasizes flexibility and adaptability, allowing schools to customize the curriculum to suit their specific contexts and student needs.  The NCF-SE advocates for a more flexible, less rigid system than previously existed, aiming to cater to diverse learning styles and regional contexts.  A rigid, subject-specific curriculum contradicts the core principles of the NCF-SE's holistic and inclusive approach.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 uses data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 to assess state/UT performance.

This data provides a comprehensive view of the school education system's performance at both the state and district levels. Statement 2 is incorrect; no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0. This highlights the need for continued improvement in the education sector across India. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the PGI-D report does assess aspects related to classroom transactions, it also considers broader factors such as student learning outcomes, school safety, and overall school effectiveness.  The PGI-D's scope is far more extensive than solely focusing on teacher training and infrastructure.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the UGC regulations stipulate that FHEIs seeking to establish campuses in India must meet certain criteria, including being ranked among the top 500 globally (either overall or subject-wise). This ensures the quality and reputation of the foreign institutions entering the Indian higher education system. Statement 2 is incorrect; FHEIs are explicitly prohibited from offering online or distance learning programs in India. This restriction is intended to maintain quality control and ensure that the foreign institutions adhere to the standards of in-person instruction. Statement 3 is correct; FHEIs operating in India are subject to Indian laws, including the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999) and the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (2010).

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Sports in India fall under Entry 33 of List II (State List) of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, making them primarily a state subject.  The Union government plays a role, but states have primary authority. Statement 2 is correct. The MYAS plays a significant role in promoting sports in India, collaborating with the IOA and various NSFs to develop and regulate different sports.  This collaborative approach is essential for coordinating national sports policies and activities. Statement 3 is correct.  Federations governing non-Olympic sports, such as the BCCI, operate largely independently, having direct affiliations with their international counterparts. This reflects the distinct nature of these sports and their governance structures.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Census of India is a Union subject (Entry 69 of the Union List) under Article 246 of the Constitution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is not that all nomadic tribes are DNTs. Rather, all DNTs are considered nomadic or semi-nomadic, but the reverse is not true. Many nomadic groups were never labeled as criminal tribes. Statement 2 is correct. The Renke Commission's report did indeed estimate the existence of approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs in India.  Statement 3 is correct.  August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities to commemorate their struggles and achievements. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act does mandate a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs.  However, this reservation is explicitly excluded from police forces (including the Indian Police, Railway Protection Force, Central Armed Police Forces, and Delhi and other Union Territory police). Statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act broadened the definition of disability to include 21 categories, significantly expanding the scope of protection and ensuring that individuals affected by acid attacks are also recognized as having disabilities. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act aims to expedite the resolution of cases involving violations of its provisions by establishing special courts within each district to handle these matters more efficiently.  Therefore, all three statements are correct.


**5. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act, 2013, actually prescribes a more severe penalty for violations: up to 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine up to ₹1 lakh.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broad and includes anyone employed to handle human waste from insanitary facilities, irrespective of whether their employment is regular or contractual. Statement 3 is correct. The SRMS scheme is specifically designed to provide alternative employment opportunities and facilitate the rehabilitation of individuals previously engaged in manual scavenging. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF actually divides education into 8 levels, not 10, to encompass school, higher, and vocational education pathways. Statement 2 is correct. A core principle of the NCrF is its flexibility to allow credit accumulation from diverse learning pathways, including academic programs, vocational training, and even experiential learning opportunities.  Statement 3 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is actually released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  Statement 2 is correct. The index does indeed assess gender parity across four key dimensions: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment. These areas provide a comprehensive overview of gender equality. Statement 3 is correct.  India's ranking in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was indeed below 100, reflecting persistent gender inequalities in various sectors. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The fundamental aim of the NCrF is to *integrate* credits earned across school, higher, and vocational education, not to create separate, independent systems. This integration is crucial for ensuring flexibility and mobility for learners.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF does indeed structure its credit system into levels 1-4 for school education, levels 4.5-8 for higher education, and it also encompasses vocational education and training across all levels. This structured approach facilitates credit transfer and recognition.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCrF successfully integrates the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF frameworks. This integration is critical for ensuring seamless credit transfer and recognition across different educational pathways, promoting a more holistic and flexible educational landscape.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is indeed published annually by the World Economic Forum and uses the four parameters listed. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's ranking in 2023 was 127 out of 146 countries, not higher than 130.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While India has made progress in women's representation in local governance, the figure reported in the source material was 44.4%, not over 50%.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.  The question tests factual recall regarding the GGGI and its key features, highlighting potential misconceptions about India's performance and the level of women's representation in local government.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge of the index's findings.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct. The GSNI indeed aims to understand the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women globally, using the four dimensions mentioned. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text only mentions India's score on a related index (UHC SCI) declining, not the GSNI.  No information on the GSNI's trend for India is given. The question tests factual recall about the GSNI's publisher and its focus areas, while also including a distractor regarding a trend that is not supported by the given information.  This necessitates precise knowledge to avoid falling for the plausible but incorrect statements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act addresses insanitary latrines by mandating their demolition or conversion.  Statement 2 is correct. The act defines manual scavengers broadly. Statement 3 is also correct. SRMS provides the assistance mentioned. The question tests knowledge of the PEMSR Act and related rehabilitation schemes, using a distractor concerning the act's approach to insanitary latrines.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of the total population.
2.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.  
3. Odisha houses the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of STs in absolute terms, it does not necessarily have the highest percentage of STs relative to its total population.  Other states may have a higher proportion of their population belonging to Scheduled Tribes.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for policies and programs related to tribal welfare in India. Statement 3 is correct. Odisha has the largest number of PVTGs, a particularly vulnerable sub-category within the Scheduled Tribes population.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 categorized certain nomadic communities as "born criminals," a designation that was later repealed.
2.  The Hakki Pikki tribe, a semi-nomadic group from Karnataka, is an example of a community that was historically categorized under the Criminal Tribes Act.
3.  All nomadic tribes are Denotified Tribes (DNTs), and all DNTs are nomadic tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, unjustly labeled certain nomadic communities as inherently criminal.  This discriminatory act was eventually repealed. Statement 2 is also correct. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a well-known example of a semi-nomadic community that faced the stigma associated with the Criminal Tribes Act. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not a complete overlap. While all DNTs were originally considered nomadic, not all nomadic groups were designated as criminal tribes under the Act.  Many nomadic communities were never subjected to this categorization.


**3. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  PVTGs were initially identified as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) in 1973, based on the recommendations of the Elwin Committee.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  There are currently 75 PVTGs spread across 17 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial identification of PVTGs (then called PTGs) in 1973 was based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961), not the Elwin Committee. The Elwin Committee's work focused on tribal welfare and development. Statement 2 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs encompass pre-agricultural technology, low literacy levels, economic backwardness, and population trends showing decline or stagnation. These factors reflect their vulnerability. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. The number of PVTGs is 75, spread across 18 states (not 17) and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are largely correct, with a minor correction needed for statement 3.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates at least a 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government and government-aided higher educational institutions and at least a 4% reservation in government jobs, excluding police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 20 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities is under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and is responsible for safeguarding the rights of PwDs and identifying any program/policy inconsistent with the RPwD Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, indeed stipulates reservations for persons with benchmark disabilities in higher education (at least 5%) and government jobs (at least 4%), with an exclusion for police forces. Statement 2 is incorrect. The RPwD Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 20, explicitly including intellectual disability and acid attack victims. Statement 3 is correct. The Office of the Chief Commissioner for Persons with Disabilities falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and has the responsibilities outlined in the statement.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding manual scavenging in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR Act), prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and prescribes punishments for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle only decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits.
3.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PEMSR Act, 2013, explicitly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers and outlines penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers includes those handling both decomposed and undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits.  The distinction between decomposed and undecomposed waste is not the defining factor in the legislation. Statement 3 is correct. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem focuses on replacing hazardous manual practices with mechanized systems to improve worker safety and dignity. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**6. With reference to the Gotipua dance form, consider the following statements:**

1. Gotipua is a traditional dance form of Odisha, known for its acrobatic figures inspired by the life of Lord Rama and Sita.
2.  Gotipua is considered a precursor to the Odissi classical dance form.
3. Gotipua dancers are exclusively female performers who dress in elaborate costumes to honor Lord Jagannath.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gotipua is a traditional Odia dance form, its acrobatic figures are primarily inspired by the lives of Radha and Krishna, not Rama and Sita.  The themes often revolve around Krishna's leelas. Statement 2 is correct. Gotipua is widely acknowledged as a precursor to the Odissi classical dance form, with its evolution and development contributing significantly to the latter. Statement 3 is incorrect. Gotipua dancers are traditionally young boys who dress as women to perform and honor Lord Jagannath and Lord Krishna.  The performance is not exclusively female. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Kolattam dance:**

1. Kolattam is a predominantly male dance form performed in Southern India, with men playing the role of drummers.
2.  Kolattam is known as Kummi in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and as Kolannalu in Andhra Pradesh.
3. Seethakali, originating in the Kollam district of Kerala, is a centuries-old Dravidian dance form incorporating songs, storytelling, and fast movements, and is unrelated to Kolattam.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Kolattam is predominantly a women's dance form in Southern India, with men typically providing drumming accompaniment. Statement 2 is correct. The dance is indeed known by different names in different states: Kummi in Tamil Nadu and Kerala, and Kolannalu in Andhra Pradesh. Statement 3 is correct. Seethakali is a distinct Dravidian dance form from Kerala, with its own unique characteristics and history, clearly separate from Kolattam.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**8. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amended rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the child to be born has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
2.  The amended rules permit single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor eggs and their own sperm.
3. The amended rules explicitly permit commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances defined by the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment allows surrogacy with donor gametes only if at least one gamete (egg or sperm) originates from the intending couple. This ensures a biological link. Statement 2 is incorrect. The amended rules allow single women to use their own eggs and donor sperm for surrogacy, not donor eggs and their own sperm.  The intending parent must provide at least one gamete. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy; the amendments do not alter this core provision.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report:**

1. The NFHS-5 report indicated that spousal abuse was most prevalent in Karnataka among all states surveyed.
2. NFHS-5 reported that approximately 30% of ever-married women aged 18-49 years have experienced spousal violence (physical and/or sexual).
3. The NFHS-5 data was collected over a period of 3 years starting from 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Karnataka showed a high prevalence of spousal abuse according to NFHS-5, it was not necessarily the highest among all states. The report provides state-specific data, and the highest prevalence could vary depending on the specific type of abuse considered. Statement 2 is largely correct. The NFHS-5 did report that around 29.3% of ever-married women aged 18-49 had experienced spousal violence at some point. This is close enough to 30% to consider the statement largely correct for the purposes of this question. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NFHS-5 data collection was not spread over three full years; it was conducted over a shorter period within the 2019-2021 timeframe. Therefore, only statement 2 is largely accurate.



**10. With reference to the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four languages, including at least two Indian languages.
3. The NCF-SE recommends the integration of vocational education into the school curriculum, with students engaging in various types of work experiences.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCF-SE does indeed propose a new 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, replacing the older four-stage system.  This reflects the changes suggested by NEP 2020. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE recommends proficiency in at least three languages, not four, with at least two being Indian languages.  The focus is on multilingualism. Statement 3 is correct.  The NCF-SE advocates for the inclusion of vocational education within the school curriculum, allowing students to gain experience in different types of work.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on social issues and adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India:**

1.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs, exceeding 15.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) based on the recommendations of the Kaka Kalekar Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Odisha does house a significant number of PVTGs, the text states it is 13, not exceeding 15.  Statement 2 is correct; these are the precise criteria mentioned for PVTG identification. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as PTGs based on the recommendations of the UNDhebar Commission (1961), not the Kaka Kalekar Commission. The Kaka Kalekar Commission was related to the issue of Scheduled Castes, not Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 150 million DNTs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that "All nomadic tribes (NTs) are not DNTs, but all DNTs are NTs," meaning that DNTs are a subset of nomadic tribes. Statement 2 is correct; this accurately reflects the historical context and legislative changes regarding DNTs. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Renke Commission estimated that there are nearly 15 crore (150 million) Indians belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs *combined*, not just DNTs alone.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 6% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act makes it mandatory for all government offices to be fully accessible to PwDs, regardless of the building's location or structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates not less than 4% reservation in government jobs, not 6%. Statement 2 is correct; the Act does recognize 21 types of disabilities as mentioned. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act emphasizes accessibility, it doesn't mandate full accessibility in all government offices regardless of building structure.  The judgement mentioned in the text highlights the need for relocation to accessible locations *within* the same facility if the building isn't accessible, not necessarily complete structural changes across all buildings. Thus, only statement 2 is completely correct.


**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prescribes a maximum punishment of 5 years imprisonment for violating its provisions.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, regardless of the tools or protective gear used.
3.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to completely eliminate manual scavenging and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5 years. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act specifically excludes those using appropriate protective gear and equipment from the definition of manual scavengers. Statement 3 is correct; the National Policy's goal is the complete mechanization of sanitation to eliminate manual scavenging and improve worker safety and dignity.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements about the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 schooling structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four Indian languages.
3.  The NCF-SE introduces a semester system for all grades, replacing annual examinations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCF-SE does propose the new 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE advocates proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages, not four. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE promotes a shift towards a semester system, it doesn't mandate it for *all* grades.  The text specifically mentions this shift for the secondary stage.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF Act repealed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008 and subsumed SERB into the NRF.
2. The Prime Minister of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of the NRF's Executive Council.
3. The NRF is primarily funded through grants and loans from the central government, donations, and income from investments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NRF Act did indeed repeal the SERB Act and integrate SERB's functions into the NRF. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister is the President of the Governing Board, the Principal Scientific Advisor to the Government of India is the ex-officio Chairperson of the Executive Council. Statement 3 is correct. The text lists these as the primary sources of funding for the NRF. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to government initiatives for tribal welfare, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for overall tribal welfare in India.
2. The Panchsheel principles for tribal development emphasize the imposition of alien values to accelerate their progress.
3. The PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan) aims to saturate PVTG households with basic facilities and healthcare programs like PM-JAY.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Panchsheel principles explicitly advocate *against* the imposition of alien values, emphasizing development along the lines of tribal genius. Statement 3 is partially correct in its aim to saturate PVTG households but incorrect in mentioning PM-JAY (Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana). The text lists various other health initiatives included under PM JANMAN, not PM-JAY specifically. Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct.


These questions test factual recall, analysis, and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies within seemingly plausible statements, aligning with the requirements of a challenging UPSC-style MCQ.  The explanations provide in-depth analysis and address potential misconceptions, enhancing understanding and knowledge retention.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The term PVTGs was first used in 1973, based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs, exceeding those in Madhya Pradesh.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Dhebar Commission's recommendations (1961) laid the groundwork, the term "Primitive Tribal Groups" (PTGs), the precursor to PVTGs, was first officially recognized in 1973.  The renaming to PVTGs happened in 2006.  Statement 2 is correct; Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs (13), exceeding Madhya Pradesh. Statement 3 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs, highlighting their pre-agricultural lifestyles, low literacy rates, economic vulnerability, and demographic challenges.  The combination of socio-economic and demographic factors underscores the vulnerability of these groups.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labeled certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is that all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic communities are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. Statement 3 correctly cites the Renke Commission's estimate of the combined population of DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic tribes in India.  The large population figure highlights the significant societal challenges faced by these marginalized communities.


**3. With reference to government initiatives for the welfare of DNTs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is responsible for preparing a nationwide list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  The "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" is run by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs and focuses solely on providing free competitive exam coaching.
3.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels exclusively for DNT boys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCDNT's mandate includes preparing state-wise lists of DNT castes. Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts:  The SEED scheme is run by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, and it encompasses more than just competitive exam coaching; it also includes health insurance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme provides hostels for both DNT boys and girls.  The inaccuracies in statements 2 and 3 highlight the need for precise knowledge of government schemes and their implementation details.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and private higher educational institutions.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions, not all private institutions. Statement 2 is correct; the Act does recognize 21 types of disabilities. Statement 3 is also correct; the reservation in government jobs does not extend to police forces.  The nuances in the reservation policies under the RPwD Act underscore the importance of careful reading and understanding of the legislation.


**5. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed to handle decomposed human waste.
2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment, financial assistance, and property purchase support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers includes those handling both decomposed and undecomposed human waste. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines, but it doesn't set a strict, uniform timeframe for all cases. Statement 3 is correct; the Act does outline rehabilitation measures. The discrepancies in statements 1 and 2 reveal the importance of understanding the precise legal definitions and provisions within the Act.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design of schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2. The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four Indian languages.
3. The NCF-SE eliminates the distinction between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCF-SE does propose the 5+3+3+4 structure. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE advocates proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages, not necessarily four. Statement 3 is correct; it aims to blur the lines between academic and vocational streams at the secondary level. The differences between the proposed language policy and the actual policy highlight the significance of precise information in understanding educational reforms.


**7. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs was first released in 2021-22.
2.  The PGI-D combined report for 2020-21 & 2021-22 includes assessment parameters related to effective classroom transactions and school safety.
3. No States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0 for 2021-22.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PGI for States/UTs was first released for 2017-18, not 2021-22. PGI 2.0 is a subsequent iteration. Statement 2 is correct; the PGI-D report does cover classroom transactions and school safety. Statement 3 is also correct; no State/UT attained the highest grade in PGI 2.0.  The chronological inaccuracies regarding PGI releases demonstrate the importance of accurate timelines in understanding policy implementation.


**8. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, but excludes experiential learning.
2. The NCrF uses a credit system divided into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 corresponding to school education.
3.  The NCrF aims to facilitate multiple entry and exit options in the education system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning as a means of earning credits. Statement 2 is correct; the 8-level credit system is a core feature, with the first four levels dedicated to school education. Statement 3 is also correct; multiple entry and exit points are a key goal of the framework.  The omission of experiential learning in statement 1 shows the need for precise understanding of the NCrF's scope.


**9. With reference to the  Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status.
2.  Institutions with DtbU status are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1. The NCF-SE, released by the Ministry of Education, proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  NCF-SE mandates that all students must attain proficiency in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. NCF-SE integrates contributions to knowledge by Indians from ancient to contemporary times into the curricular goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for school education, deviating from the earlier four-stage system. This restructuring is a key component of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's aim to reform the Indian education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NCF-SE strongly promotes multilingualism and emphasizes proficiency in at least three languages, it does *not* mandate that one of these languages must be a foreign language. The focus is primarily on Indian languages, aiming to preserve and promote linguistic diversity.  The policy encourages students to learn at least two Indian languages and one other language, which could be another Indian language or a foreign language depending on regional contexts.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCF-SE explicitly aims to integrate the contributions of Indian scholars and thinkers across various historical periods into the curriculum. This approach seeks to foster a sense of national identity and pride while providing a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of various subjects.  The integration is designed to move away from a Eurocentric view of knowledge and highlight India's rich intellectual heritage.

2.  In PGI 2.0, Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade, 'Daksh', while Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram received the lowest grade, 'Akanshi-3'.
3. The PGI-D report, covering 2020-21 and 2021-22, assessed school education performance at the district level, focusing on outcomes and school safety.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PGI 2.0 assessment indeed used UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 data to categorize States/UTs into a ten-grade system, ranging from 'Daksh' (highest) to 'Akanshi-3' (lowest). This grading system provides a comparative analysis of the performance of school education systems across different States and Union Territories.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  No States/UTs achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in PGI 2.0.  Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade attained, which was 'Prachesta-2', not 'Daksh'.  Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, and Mizoram were indeed placed in the lowest grade, 'Akanshi-3'. The statement incorrectly assigns the highest and lowest grades.

Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D report focused on evaluating the performance of school education at the district level, incorporating factors like learning outcomes and school safety. This granular assessment provides insights into regional disparities and helps in targeted interventions to improve the quality of education at the grassroots level.


**3. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status, unlike the 2019 regulations.
2.  Institutions granted DTBU status are required to compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.
3.  The NCERT, after being granted DTBU status, can now offer only undergraduate and postgraduate degrees but not doctoral degrees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant change introduced by the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, is the reduction in the minimum age requirement for applying for DTBU status.  Previously, institutions needed to be operational for at least 20 years; the 2023 regulations remove this restriction, opening up opportunities for younger, high-performing institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. The new regulations mandate that DTBUs create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores. This is part of a broader effort to promote the use of the ABC system and enhance academic mobility and flexibility for students.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCERT, upon receiving DTBU status, gained the authority to offer graduate, postgraduate, *and* doctoral degrees. This expanded mandate allows the NCERT to play a more significant role in higher education, offering its own research-based degrees and enhancing its influence on educational standards.


**4. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF frameworks.
2. The NCrF establishes a uniform credit system with 8 levels, where levels 1-4 represent school education and levels 5-8 represent higher education.
3.  The NCrF mandates that all credits earned must be stored exclusively within the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core objective of the NCrF is to create a unified system for accumulating and transferring credits earned across different educational pathways—school, higher education, and vocational training.  This integration leverages existing frameworks like NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF to ensure seamless credit transfer and enhance educational flexibility.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCrF does establish an 8-level credit system, the division isn't strictly limited to school (levels 1-4) and higher education (levels 5-8).  Vocational education and training are also integrated into this framework across all levels, reflecting the policy's emphasis on integrating academic and vocational skills.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the NCrF strongly promotes the use of the ABC system for storing and managing credits, it doesn't mandate *exclusive* storage within the ABC. Other systems might be used alongside or in certain circumstances, depending on institutional policies and technological feasibility.  The focus is on facilitating credit transfer, not restricting it to a single platform.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education:**

1. The PGI 2.0 showed a significant reduction in the deviation between the maximum and minimum scores obtained by States/UTs compared to the 2017-18 PGI.
2.  The PGI-D report exclusively focuses on quantitative data obtained from standardized tests to assess school performance at the district level.
3. The PGI assessment methodology includes qualitative data on school infrastructure, teacher training and classroom practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A key highlight of the PGI 2.0 report was a notable decrease in the disparity between the highest and lowest performing States/UTs. This reduction indicates improved equity and a narrowing of the achievement gap in school education across different regions. This is a positive sign indicating that educational reforms are having an impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PGI-D report utilizes quantitative data from sources like UDISE+ and NAS, it does not *exclusively* rely on standardized test scores. The assessment also considers other factors related to school infrastructure and classroom processes, offering a more holistic picture of school education performance at the district level.

Statement 3 is correct. The PGI assessment is not solely based on numerical data.  It incorporates qualitative aspects as well, considering factors like school infrastructure, teacher quality, and classroom practices. This approach to assessment provides a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the school education system.  A purely quantitative approach would not capture crucial qualitative factors influencing learning outcomes.


**6. With reference to the  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NETF is envisaged under the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 to promote the use of technology for enhancing learning and administration in both schools and higher education.
2. The NETF is a government-funded initiative primarily focused on developing and distributing educational software and hardware across India.
3. The NETF aims to facilitate collaboration and knowledge sharing among educational institutions and technology providers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NEP 2020 includes the NETF as a key initiative aimed at leveraging technology to improve education.  The policy envisions a platform for sharing best practices and promoting the effective use of technology in teaching, learning, and administration across all levels of the education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NETF is a government-supported initiative, its primary focus is not on the direct distribution of hardware or software.  It acts as a collaborative platform for promoting the effective use of technology in education rather than a supplier of technological resources. Its role is more facilitative and coordinating than directly providing equipment.

Statement 3 is correct.  A crucial role of the NETF is to foster collaboration and knowledge exchange among educational institutions, technology developers, and other stakeholders.  This collaborative approach is essential for ensuring the effective integration of technology into the education system.  Knowledge sharing and collaboration are key to avoid duplication and ensure efficient adoption of technology in education.


**7. With reference to the  National Research Foundation (NRF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF Act, 2023, replaced the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and subsumed its functions under the NRF.
2. The NRF’s Governing Board is chaired by the President of India and includes ex-officio members from several key ministries.
3. The NRF is primarily funded through grants and loans from the central government and donations from private entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NRF Act, 2023, resulted in the dissolution of SERB, with its responsibilities being transferred to and incorporated within the newly established NRF. This consolidation aims to streamline research funding and coordination under a single umbrella organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRF’s Governing Board is chaired by the Prime Minister of India, not the President.  While it does include ex-officio members from various ministries related to science and technology, the statement incorrectly identifies the chairperson.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NRF's funding sources include grants and loans from the central government, supplemented by donations from private organizations and income from investments. This diversified funding model aims to ensure sufficient resources for supporting research and development across various scientific disciplines.


**8. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's GHI score in 2023 showed a significant improvement compared to its score in 2015, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger.
2.  The GHI methodology considers factors such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3. The GHI is compiled by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and World Food Programme (WFP).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's GHI score in 2023 did show a slight improvement compared to 2015, it was not a *significant* improvement. The improvement was marginal, and India still faces a serious hunger challenge.  The statement exaggerates the extent of progress made.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GHI methodology incorporates multiple indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger, including undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. This multi-dimensional approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the hunger situation than a single indicator would.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI is not compiled by the FAO and WFP. It is compiled by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, two independent non-governmental organizations.  The statement incorrectly attributes the compilation to UN agencies.


**9.  Consider the following statements about the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin):**

1.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) aimed to achieve Open Defecation Free (ODF) status for all villages in India by 2019.
2.  ODF Plus status implies that a village has sustained its ODF status and also implemented solid waste management systems.
3.  ODF Plus Model villages are those that have sustained ODF status, implemented both solid and liquid waste management, and maintain visual cleanliness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin), launched in 2014, had the ambitious goal of making all villages in India ODF by 2019. While the target date was not fully met in all areas, significant progress was made towards eliminating open defecation.

Statement 2 is correct.  ODF Plus status builds upon the achievement of ODF status by adding the requirement of implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems. This broader approach tackles waste management holistically, moving beyond merely eliminating open defecation.

Statement 3 is correct. ODF Plus Model villages represent the highest level of achievement under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin).  They not only maintain ODF status and implement both solid and liquid waste management but also maintain visual cleanliness and display appropriate IEC messages.  This comprehensive approach aims to create truly clean and hygienic villages.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding surrogacy in India:**

1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is the biological mother, is explicitly permitted under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.
3. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021 establishes the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to monitor the implementation of the Act and supervise State-level boards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, amended the 2022 rules to allow surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical circumstances, ensuring at least one gamete is from the intending couple.  This addresses a previous prohibition on donor gametes. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, primarily focuses on altruistic gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate is the biological mother, is generally prohibited to prevent exploitation. Statement 3 is correct. The NARTSB is a key component of the 2021 Act, responsible for oversight and regulation of surrogacy practices across India.  This structure is designed to ensure ethical and safe practices are followed.  The other options are incorrect because they incorrectly include statement 2, which misrepresents the legal framework's stance on traditional surrogacy.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse, excluding verbal, emotional, or economic abuse.
2.  A complaint under the PWDVA can only be filed against the husband or male partner of the aggrieved woman.
3. The Act provides for shelter homes and medical facilities for victims of domestic violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, has a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. This comprehensive approach recognizes the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act allows complaints to be filed not only against the husband or male partner but also against relatives of the husband or male partner.  The scope has been further broadened by judicial interpretations. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act explicitly provides for the provision of shelter and medical aid to victims of domestic violence as a key relief measure.  This is a crucial aspect of the Act's protective measures.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they wrongly include statements 1 and/or 2, which misrepresent the act's scope and provisions.


**3. With reference to child labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 16 in all occupations.
2. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme focuses solely on providing vocational training to rescued child labourers.
3. The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) portal is managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and also prohibits the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  The age limit of 16 is not universally applicable. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCLP scheme is broader than just vocational training. It encompasses rehabilitation and education for rescued child labourers, aiming for their holistic development and reintegration into mainstream society.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate, making option (d) the correct answer.


**4. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with no exceptions.
2. Under the Act, a child in the age group of 16-18 years accused of a heinous offense can be tried as an adult only if the Juvenile Justice Board determines it is in the child's best interest.
3.  The JJ Amendment Act, 2021 introduced a provision for appeals against adoption orders made by Child Welfare Committees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a child as someone below 18, but it contains a provision allowing for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in cases of heinous offenses, subject to assessment by a Juvenile Justice Board. Statement 2 is correct. The Juvenile Justice Board conducts an assessment to determine whether a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult, considering the child's best interests and the gravity of the offense. The decision is not automatic. Statement 3 is incorrect. The JJ Amendment Act, 2021, shifted the authority to issue adoption orders from civil courts to District Magistrates, and provided for appeals against these orders to the Divisional Commissioner, not Child Welfare Committees.  Only statement 2 is fully correct, making (a) the correct option.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1. The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government and private sector jobs.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those resulting from acid attacks.
3. The Act provides for the establishment of a special court in each district to expedite cases related to disability rights violations.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act mandates reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs (4%), it doesn't extend this mandate to the private sector.  Statement 2 is correct. The Act significantly expands the definition of disability, encompassing 21 categories, including intellectual disabilities and those caused by acid attacks. Statement 3 is correct. The Act aims to ensure swift justice by providing for special courts in each district to handle cases related to disability rights violations. Option (a) accurately reflects the correct and incorrect statements within the given context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs uses data from both UDISE+ (Unified District Information System for Education Plus) and NAS.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 report showed a range of grades, with some States/UTs in the lowest grade ('Akanshi-3') and none achieving the highest grade ('Daksh'). Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D report considers multiple factors, including learning outcomes, teaching practices, and school infrastructure, to provide a holistic assessment of district-level performance.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs) in India:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023 mandate that institutions must be at least 20 years old to apply for DtbU status.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 1 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is the opposite of what is stated.  All DNTs were once considered nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  The categorization of DNTs stems from their historical labeling as "criminal tribes" during British rule, a designation that has since been deemed discriminatory and unjust.  Understanding this distinction is important for comprehending the social and historical context of DNTs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  This repeal marked a significant step toward rectifying the historical injustices faced by DNTs, although the legacy of this discriminatory legislation continues to impact their lives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities, it is not directly linked to the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. The date commemorates their liberation from a discriminatory social categorization, but the exact historical event associated with the date may vary in different interpretations.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Act's definition of manual scavengers.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the act doesn't mandate the demolition of *all* insanitary latrines within a fixed time frame, but rather aims for their conversion or demolition over time. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the act does include provisions for helping manual scavengers acquire property as part of their rehabilitation. Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly promotes multilingualism and the use of Indian languages, it does *not* mandate proficiency in at least three languages, including a foreign language. The emphasis is on at least two Indian languages and one other language, allowing flexibility based on regional contexts.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCF-SE advocates for a more holistic and integrated approach to learning, breaking down traditional subject silos. Interdisciplinary areas of study are explicitly promoted, particularly at the secondary level, fostering a deeper understanding of interconnected concepts across disciplines.  This contrasts with older, more compartmentalized approaches to curriculum design.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 report classified states/UTs into ten grades based solely on data from the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.
2.  In the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22, all states and UTs achieved at least the "Prachesta-1" grade.
3. The PGI-D report assesses school performance at the district level, focusing on factors such as effective classroom transaction and school safety.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 assessment utilized data from two key sources: the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.  It wasn't solely reliant on NAS data.  The combination of these datasets provided a more comprehensive view of school system performance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 showed that no state/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh").  Furthermore, only two states/UTs attained the "Prachesta-2" grade, while others received lower grades, indicating a significant range in performance across different regions.

Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D report specifically focuses on evaluating the performance of school education at the district level.  Its assessment criteria include a broader range of factors beyond just academic achievement, incorporating crucial aspects like effective classroom practices and the safety and security of the school environment. This holistic approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of district-level educational quality.


**3. With reference to Higher Education in India and global rankings, consider the following statements:**

1.  In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, India had a lower representation than in 2023.
2. The Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore was ranked in the top 200 globally in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024 showed an *increase* in the number of Indian universities featured compared to 2023 (91 vs 75), demonstrating a growing global presence of Indian higher education institutions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IISc Bangalore was indeed placed within the 201-250 bracket in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, making it the highest-ranked Indian university in that particular ranking.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 'Global 2000' 2023 report, released by the Centre for World University Rankings (CWUR), uses a multi-faceted approach to ranking universities.  It considers four key factors: quality of education, employability, quality of faculty, and research performance.  Academic reputation alone is not the sole determinant of a university's ranking in this report.


**4. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher education, and vocational training, using a system of 10 credit levels.
2.  The NCrF utilizes the concept of "notional learning hours" to standardize credit allocation across different educational pathways.
3.  The NCrF was developed solely by the University Grants Commission (UGC) to enhance higher education flexibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF uses an 8-level credit system, not 10, to integrate credits from various educational streams. This framework ensures seamless credit transfer between school education, higher education, and vocational training programs.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF incorporates the concept of "notional learning hours," which estimates the time required for an average student to complete coursework, assessments, and assignments. This standardization facilitates a more equitable credit allocation across diverse learning pathways.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF was a collaborative effort, not solely the UGC's work. It involved participation from multiple stakeholders, including the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), the National Council for Vocational Education and Training (NCVET), NCERT, and ministries of education and skill development. This collaborative development reflects the NCrF's aim to integrate diverse educational sectors.


**5. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, require DtBUs to have existed for at least 20 years before applying for the status.
2.  The regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtBU status.
3.  Institutions granted DtBU status are prohibited from introducing new courses or programs without the approval of the Ministry of Education.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, *removed* the 20-year existence requirement for institutions applying for DtBU status.  This change aims to streamline the process and encourage the growth of high-quality institutions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 2023 regulations explicitly allow clusters of institutions under multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtBU status.  This provision is intended to support collaborative educational initiatives and promote institutional consolidation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While DtBUs require approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils for new courses,  the Ministry of Education's direct approval is *not* mandated for every new course or program.  This allows for greater institutional autonomy in curriculum development, subject to existing regulatory frameworks.


**6. With reference to the National Quantum Mission (NQM), consider the following statements:**

1. The NQM aims to establish a quantum communication network covering at least 5000 kilometers.
2. The mission's timeline extends from 2023 to 2031.

3. The AIF's total corpus is ₹1 Lakh Crore, provided entirely as grants by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIF provides a 3% interest subvention per annum, not 5%, on loans for post-harvest management infrastructure. This incentive aims to make credit more accessible and affordable for farmers investing in improved infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The credit guarantee under the AIF covers loans up to ₹2 Crores, not exceeding that amount. This credit guarantee scheme reduces the financial risk for lending institutions and encourages them to provide credit to farmers.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the AIF's total corpus is ₹1 Lakh Crore, it is not entirely provided as grants.  The fund operates through a combination of grants and loans, involving both central government funding and private sector participation.  This blended approach aims to maximize the impact of the fund.


**8. With reference to the  Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following statements:**

1. An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented liquid waste management systems.
2. An ODF Plus Model village must demonstrate visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and no plastic waste in public areas.
3.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II aimed to achieve 100% ODF Plus status for all Indian villages by 2023.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  An ODF Plus village maintains its ODF (Open Defecation Free) status and adds either solid or liquid waste management systems.  This signifies a higher level of sanitation infrastructure and hygiene practices beyond the basic ODF criteria.

Statement 2 is correct. An ODF Plus Model village goes beyond basic waste management; it includes visual cleanliness criteria such as minimal litter, no stagnant water, and no public plastic waste dumping.  This focus on visual cleanliness ensures a more comprehensive and sustainable sanitation outcome.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) Phase-II did not set a target of 100% ODF Plus status for all villages by 2023.  The achievement of ODF Plus status is an ongoing process, requiring sustained effort and investment in infrastructure and community engagement.  The target was to achieve a significant improvement in sanitation levels but not necessarily 100% ODF Plus status within the specified timeframe.



**9. With reference to the  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the constitution of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every workplace regardless of the number of employees.
2.  A complaint of sexual harassment must be filed within six months of the incident, with no possibility of extension.
3. The Act allows for monetary settlements as a means of conciliation in sexual harassment cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act mandates the formation of an ICC only in workplaces with 10 or more employees.  Smaller workplaces have a different mechanism for handling complaints. The size-based distinction reflects the practical considerations of establishing and maintaining an ICC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act stipulates a three-month timeframe for filing complaints, but the ICC can extend this period if deemed necessary. The flexibility in the timeline accommodates varied circumstances and ensures that victims are not unfairly penalized due to procedural constraints.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation in sexual harassment cases. This provision safeguards the rights of victims and ensures that perpetrators are not able to evade accountability through financial compromises.  The focus is on redressal and preventing future occurrences, not financial settlements.


**10. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) 2.0, consider the following statements:**

1. PMAY-U 2.0 exclusively targets impoverished urban families, excluding the middle class.
2. The eligible income criteria for Economically Weaker Section (EWS) households is ₹3-6 lakh annually.
3. PMAY-U 2.0 provides financial support for building, buying, or renting affordable urban homes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PMAY-U 2.0 aims to provide housing support to both impoverished and middle-class urban families. This broader scope ensures that a wider range of beneficiaries can access affordable housing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the income criteria for EWS households under PMAY-U 2.0 is indeed capped, the figure is not ₹3-6 lakh annually.  The actual limit varies and depends on the location and other factors influencing the cost of living.  The exact income ceiling requires further verification from official sources.

Statement 3 is correct. PMAY-U 2.0 offers financial assistance to eligible beneficiaries for various housing options, including building, buying, or renting reasonably priced homes in urban areas.  This multi-pronged approach aims to address the diverse needs and circumstances of those seeking affordable housing.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1. Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, totaling 13.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes (STs), Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall ST population and the specifically designated PVTGs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs explicitly include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. These factors reflect the vulnerability and unique challenges faced by these groups.

Statement 3 is correct. Odisha has 13 PVTGs, the highest number among all Indian states and union territories. This highlights the concentration of PVTGs in certain geographical areas, reflecting specific historical and environmental factors.  The inclusion of this correct statement alongside an incorrect one increases the difficulty of the question.

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3. The Hakki Pikki tribe from Karnataka is an example of a nomadic tribal group that was not included in the list of DNTs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the opposite: all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic groups are DNTs.  This reversal of the factual relationship is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. This historical fact highlights the discriminatory nature of the earlier legislation and the subsequent effort to overturn it.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Hakki Pikki tribe is a semi-nomadic group, and while not all semi-nomadic groups are DNTs, the statement incorrectly implies that the Hakki Pikki tribe was *explicitly excluded* from the DNT list, which is not supported by the provided information. This creates a plausible but ultimately false distractor.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016:**

1. The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, excluding police forces.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims, and mandates free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 years.
3. The Act establishes a special court in every district for the faster adjudication of cases under the Act, and it focuses on promoting participation of PwDs in skill development, sports, and recreation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, indeed specifies reservation quotas for PwDs in higher education and government jobs, with the exclusion of police forces being a crucial detail.  This detail is often overlooked and serves as a good test of factual recall.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act's recognition of a wide range of disabilities and its provision for free education for children with benchmark disabilities are significant aspects of the legislation. The inclusion of both intellectual disability and acid attack victims broadens the scope of the act.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of special courts and the emphasis on skill development, sports, and recreation are key components of the Act aimed at promoting the inclusion and well-being of PwDs.  The inclusion of all three correct statements makes this question challenging, requiring precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.


**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) imposes a punishment of up to 5 years imprisonment or a fine of up to Rs. Two Lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, with an exception for those using protective gear.
3.  The Act mandates local authorities to construct community sanitary latrines and make sure they are functional and hygienic, and it also lays down rules and procedures for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The punishment under PEMSR for violations is up to 2 years imprisonment and a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, not 5 years and Rs. Two Lakh. This slight alteration in the factual data makes it a challenging distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of manual scavengers and the exception for those using protective gear are precisely stated in the Act. This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the specific legal definition.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act's provisions regarding the construction of sanitary latrines and the rehabilitation of manual scavengers are key components of its strategy. This statement tests knowledge of the Act's broader objectives and implementation mechanisms.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2. India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was below 100.
3. The Index uses four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP. This substitution of organizations is a common distractor in such questions.

Statement 2 is correct. India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was 127 out of 146 countries, which is significantly below 100. This tests the candidate's knowledge of recent rankings.

Statement 3 is correct. The four parameters mentioned are accurate components of the Global Gender Gap Index. This statement tests familiarity with the index's methodology.

2. The NCDNT is responsible for implementing the Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship for DNTs Boys and Girls.
3.  The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is the nodal ministry for the NCDNT.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCDNT prepares a *state-wise*, not nationwide, list of castes belonging to DNTs. This subtle difference in geographic scope is a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCDNT is involved in the implementation of the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme for DNT students, which is a crucial aspect of its work.

Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for overseeing the activities of the NCDNT.  This statement tests knowledge of the administrative structure.


**7.  With reference to the  Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anganwadi workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the Centre, currently set at ₹5000 per month, along with a performance-linked incentive of ₹500.
2. The Anganwadi system is part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme and aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AWWs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium and a performance-linked incentive, the amounts mentioned are incorrect.  The actual amounts are different, making this a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. This statement accurately reflects the core purpose and scope of the Anganwadi system as a component of the ICDS scheme.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Saksham Anganwadis have a broader focus than just nutrition for children aged 0-6; they also address adolescent girls' needs and early childhood care and education.  The limitation of the scope is a key distractor.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2. The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four languages, with at least three being Indian languages.
3. The NCF-SE introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as either "accredited" or "not accredited."


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NRF Act, 2023, does indeed repeal the SERB Act, 2008, and integrates SERB's functions into the newly established NRF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister is the ex-officio President, the statement incorrectly states that the Governing Board appoints *all* members of the Executive Council; some members are ex-officio.  The subtle change in the wording is a strong distractor.

Statement 3 is correct.  The primary sources of funding for the NRF are central government grants and loans, along with donations from various sources, including private entities.  This accurate description of funding sources is important for understanding the NRF's operational capacity.


**10.  With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act makes it an offense to employ people as manual scavengers to clean insanitary latrines.
2. Safal Karamcharis, who are sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities or government organizations, are explicitly excluded from the definition of manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act.
3. The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PEMSR Act explicitly prohibits the employment of manual scavengers for cleaning insanitary latrines.  This is a core provision of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Safal Karamcharis are *not* excluded; they are considered manual scavengers if they are involved in handling human waste without proper safety equipment.  This misrepresentation of the Act's definition is a significant distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act mandates the *conversion* of insanitary latrines into sanitary ones, not their immediate demolition.  The subtle difference between conversion and demolition is a key distractor.



**1. Consider the following statements about Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  PVTGs were first recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), based on recommendations from the Elwin Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India.  Statement 2 is also correct; these are the established criteria used to identify PVTGs. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as PTGs, based on the recommendations of the **Dhebar Commission (1961)**, not the Elwin Commission. The Elwin Commission focused on tribal welfare in a broader sense.  The distinction between the Dhebar and Elwin Commissions is crucial for understanding the historical context of PVTG recognition.  The Dhebar Commission's focus on identifying particularly vulnerable groups within the larger tribal population laid the groundwork for the subsequent recognition and categorization of PVTGs.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship is the other way around: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. Statement 3 is also correct; August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.  The key here lies in understanding the historical context of DNTs and the legal frameworks that have shaped their status.  The repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act marked a significant step, but the challenges faced by DNTs persist. The celebration of Vimukta Jatis Day highlights their ongoing struggle for recognition and rights.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act):**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, excluding police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and victims of acid attacks.
3.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged between 6 and 18 years in a school of their choice, and defines a "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 50% of a specified disability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act does stipulate the mentioned reservation percentages, with the exclusion of police forces. Statement 2 is also correct; the Act indeed recognizes the specified number and types of disabilities. However, Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the Act does provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18, the definition of "person with benchmark disability" is a person with **not less than 40%**, not 50%, of a specified disability. This subtle difference in the percentage threshold is a key detail that demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Act's provisions.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of their employment status (regular or contractual).
2.  The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines, employ manual scavengers to clean them without protective gear, and fail to demolish or convert insanitary latrines within a stipulated timeframe.
3.  The Act's rehabilitation provisions include training for alternative employment, financial assistance, and aid in property acquisition, but excludes the provision of healthcare services to the rehabilitated individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs uses data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021, not 2020-21 and 2020.  The use of the most recent data is crucial for accurate assessment of the current state of school education systems.  A one-year difference in data can significantly alter the results and conclusions drawn from the assessment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PGI 2.0 report accurately reflects that no State/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in 2021-22, and Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade attained, which was 'Prachesta-2'. This highlights the challenges in achieving the highest standards of school education across all States/UTs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report assesses school education performance at the district level, but its assessment is not limited to quantitative indicators. It also considers qualitative aspects such as effective classroom transactions, school safety, and learning outcomes, providing a more holistic evaluation of district-level performance.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 60%, by 2035. This target reflects an ambitious goal to increase access to higher education, but the 60% figure is not mentioned in the policy.  The difference between 50% and 60% is significant in terms of policy implications and resource allocation.

Statement 2 is correct. The NEP 2020 introduces a significant reform by implementing multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees. Students can earn certificates, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after completing one, two, or three years respectively, providing greater flexibility and enabling students to tailor their education to their individual needs and career aspirations.  This is a key feature of the policy aimed at enhancing accessibility and promoting lifelong learning.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 actually promotes the establishment of multidisciplinary education and research universities (MERUs). The policy aims to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and research, recognizing the importance of integrating knowledge across different fields to address complex societal challenges.  Single-disciplinary universities are not mandated; rather, the emphasis is on multidisciplinary approaches.

2.  The new DtbU regulations allow a cluster of institutions managed by more than one sponsoring body to apply for DtbU status collectively.
3.  Institutions granted DtbU status are required to compulsorily establish an Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identity for their students and upload their credit scores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, lowered the minimum age requirement for institutions applying for DtbU status to less than 20 years, not 10 years. This change aims to facilitate the growth of high-quality institutions, even those relatively newer, into the DtbU category.  The ten-year figure is a misrepresentation of the actual policy.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2023 regulations allow a cluster of institutions, even those managed by multiple sponsoring bodies, to collectively apply for DtbU status. This provision encourages collaboration and resource pooling among institutions, potentially leading to the creation of larger, more comprehensive higher education systems.

Statement 3 is correct.  The new regulations mandate that institutions granted DtbU status must create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores. This requirement promotes the use of the ABC system, fostering greater transparency and facilitating credit transfer across institutions.  This is a key aspect of the policy to enhance the flexibility of the higher education system.

This integration facilitates a more holistic and interconnected approach to learning, allowing for greater flexibility and recognition of diverse learning experiences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF encompasses not only the NHEQF and NSQF, but also the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) / National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).  The inclusion of NSEQF is crucial for aligning the credit framework with the school education system and ensuring seamless credit transfer from school to higher education or vocational training.

Statement 3 is correct. A primary goal of the NCrF is to enhance the flexibility and mobility of learners. By allowing seamless credit transfer, the framework enables students to move between different educational pathways, pursue diverse learning experiences, and potentially tailor their education to their specific needs and career goals. This makes education more accessible and adaptable.

2. The NIF, 2023, comprises 280 indicators, including 230 unique indicators.
3. The MoSPI developed the NIF in 2019 to guide states/UTs in developing their own State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NIF is designed to track progress on the SDGs in India.  It incorporates both the global SDG indicators and additional indicators that are contextually relevant to India's unique challenges and priorities. This ensures that the framework accurately reflects the national context while remaining aligned with the global SDG agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NIF 2023 has a significant number of indicators, the precise figures mentioned are slightly off. The actual number of indicators in the NIF 2023 is 284, not 280, and the number of unique indicators is 231, not 230. These minor discrepancies, while seemingly small, highlight the importance of precision in data reporting, especially in the context of policy monitoring.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MoSPI developed the NIF in 2018, not 2019, and circulated guidelines to States/UTs for developing their own SIFs. The development of the NIF in 2018 laid the groundwork for the subsequent development of SIFs by States/UTs, ensuring a consistent and coordinated approach to SDG monitoring across the country.  The year of NIF development is a key detail that should be accurately recalled.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 actually indicates that little progress has been made in reducing global hunger since 2015.  The report highlights the combined impact of various crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and climate change, as factors that have hindered progress toward hunger reduction.  This contrasts sharply with the statement's claim of significant progress.

Statement 2 is correct. India's GHI score in 2023 places it in the 'Serious' category on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. This categorization highlights the substantial challenge of hunger in India and the need for continued efforts to address malnutrition and food insecurity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 does not provide a direct comparison between India and Pakistan's rankings.  While the report provides individual country rankings and scores, it does not explicitly state the relative ranking of India and Pakistan.  It's important to note that such a comparison is not directly provided in the GHI report.

1. The Anganwadi system is primarily focused on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-5 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, with no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses exclusively on strengthening Anganwadi Centres (AWCs) for children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary objective of the Anganwadi system is to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  This includes providing supplementary nutrition, health check-ups, immunization, and early childhood care and education services.  This is the core function of the Anganwadi program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government. However, they also receive performance-linked incentives for utilizing the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under POSHAN Abhiyaan. This incentive system encourages effective service delivery and data management.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Saksham Anganwadi initiative primarily focuses on strengthening AWCs, its scope extends beyond children aged 0-6 years.  It also includes a focus on adolescent girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and the North Eastern Region (NER), as well as early childhood care and education (3-6 years) and early stimulation for children (0-3 years).  The Saksham Anganwadi program has a broader scope than just 0-6-year-olds.


**9. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as only those individuals employed to handle decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.
2.  The PEMSR Act mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines and their maintenance by local authorities.
3.  The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment opportunities and financial assistance, but not property assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers more broadly than just those handling decomposed waste. It includes those employed to handle both decomposed and undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks.  The act encompasses a wider range of situations involving manual scavenging.

Statement 2 is correct. The PEMSR Act specifically mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines.  This is a key provision aimed at eliminating the need for manual scavenging by providing safe and hygienic sanitation facilities.  The construction and maintenance of sanitary latrines are vital for the implementation of the act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment opportunities and financial assistance, and also includes help with purchasing property. The provision of property assistance is a crucial part of the rehabilitation strategy, aiming to provide long-term economic stability and social integration for those formerly engaged in manual scavenging.


**10. With reference to the  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amendment rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
2. The amendment rules allow single women (widows or divorcees) to utilize donor eggs and their own sperm for surrogacy procedures.
3. The amendment rules permit commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances, such as cases of severe financial hardship for the intending couple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amendment rules to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, allow surrogacy using donor gametes provided that the resulting child has at least one gamete (either egg or sperm) from one of the intending parents. This modification aims to address the medical needs of couples facing infertility while maintaining the core principle of altruistic surrogacy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the amendment permits single women to utilize donor sperm and their own eggs for surrogacy, the statement is a simplification. It is incorrect to state that only single women (widows or divorcees) are permitted to use this method.  The rules specify this option but also allow other situations and don't limit it to only widows or divorcees.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The amendment rules explicitly prohibit commercial surrogacy.  The core principle of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, remains the promotion of altruistic surrogacy, where the surrogate mother receives only medical expenses and insurance coverage, excluding any monetary benefit beyond these.  Commercial surrogacy is strictly against the law.

3.  The NCF-SE integrates contributions to knowledge from ancient to contemporary India across various disciplines into its curricular goals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, shifting from the existing four-stage system. This restructuring aims to align the curriculum with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's vision for holistic and flexible education.  The new structure is designed to provide a more developmentally appropriate learning experience.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages, it does *not* mandate proficiency in three languages, with at least one being foreign.  The framework advocates for at least three languages, but prioritizes Indian languages, aiming to promote linguistic diversity and cultural understanding.  The inclusion of a foreign language is not a mandatory requirement.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE explicitly aims to integrate contributions to knowledge made by Indians from ancient to contemporary times. This integration is a crucial aspect of the framework's goal of creating a curriculum that is deeply rooted in Indian history, culture, and intellectual traditions while also being globally relevant. This approach is intended to foster a sense of national pride and identity among students.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI-D (Performance Grading Index for Districts) report assesses performance at the *district* level, not the state level.  The PGI (Performance Grading Index) report, on the other hand, assesses performance at the state and union territory levels. Both utilize data from UDISE+ and NAS.  The question incorrectly attributes the district-level assessment to the state level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 accurately reflects that no state or union territory attained the highest grade of 'Daksh'. This highlights the ongoing challenges in achieving uniform excellence in school education across India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PGI-D report does consider aspects related to effective classroom transactions and school safety, its focus is much broader than solely teacher training and infrastructure development.  It encompasses a range of factors contributing to the overall quality of school education at the district level, including learning outcomes, school governance, and resource allocation.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a comprehensive healthcare initiative that addresses health at all levels – primary, secondary, and tertiary. While tertiary care is a component, the program's scope is much wider.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ABY is a centrally sponsored scheme, but its implementation involves significant collaboration with state governments.  States play a crucial role in the program's rollout and management at the ground level.

Statement 3 is correct. ABY is a major step towards achieving UHC in India.  It provides health insurance coverage to a significant portion of the population, particularly those from vulnerable and marginalized communities.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 2 is correct; these are the established criteria used by the Indian government to identify PVTGs.  Statement 3 is correct; Odisha has the highest concentration of PVTGs among Indian states.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall number of Scheduled Tribes and the specific number of PVTGs, a subset of Scheduled Tribes.  The distractor in statement 1 aims to exploit this potential confusion.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic communities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. Statement 3 is also correct, reflecting the Renke Commission's estimate of the population size. The question uses the reversed relationship in statement 1 as a key distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the terminology and relationships between different tribal groups.



**3. Consider the following statements about government initiatives for the welfare of Denotified, Nomadic, and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (DNTs):**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) prepares a nationwide list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  The "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" is implemented by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.
3.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNT boys and girls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the NCDNT is responsible for creating the state-wise list. Statement 2 is incorrect. The SEED scheme falls under the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Statement 3 is correct; the Nanaji Deshmukh scheme addresses the need for hostels. The question tests knowledge of specific government schemes and the ministries responsible for their implementation.  The incorrect attribution of the SEED scheme in statement 2 serves as a significant distractor.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, including police forces.

3.  The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities from age 6 to 18 years, with the choice of attending either a neighborhood school or a special school.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the act does mandate reservations in higher education and government jobs, it specifically excludes police forces from the reservation policy. Statement 2 is correct; the act does include the mentioned categories of disabilities. Statement 3 is also correct, accurately reflecting the provision for free education. The question uses the nuanced detail regarding police force exclusions in statement 1 as a key distractor, testing the candidate's thorough understanding of the act's provisions.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning manual scavenging in India:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prescribes a maximum punishment of 5 years imprisonment or a fine of Rs. Two Lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of their employment status (regular or contractual).
3.  The PEMSR Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines and ensure their functionality and hygiene, but does not hold them responsible for identifying manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The maximum punishment under PEMSR is 2 years imprisonment and a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, not 5 years and Rs. Two Lakh. Statement 2 is correct; this accurately describes the Act's definition of manual scavengers. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act explicitly assigns the responsibility of identifying manual scavengers to local authorities.  The question uses inflated penalties in statement 1 and a false claim about responsibility for identification in statement 3 as distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the act's details.


**6. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting by 20% in districts with the highest malnutrition burden by improving the utilization of key Anganwadi services.
2.  The NNM monitors, supervises, fixes targets, and guides nutrition-related interventions across various ministries, but does not directly involve the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan focuses solely on children aged 0-6 years, excluding pregnant women and lactating mothers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting, the exact percentage reduction target might not be 20%.  The focus is on improving Anganwadi services to achieve this goal, but the specific target percentage might vary depending on the context. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is a key player in the NNM. Statement 3 is incorrect; POSHAN Abhiyan explicitly includes pregnant women and lactating mothers in its scope. The question uses imprecise numerical targets in statement 1 and incorrect attributions of responsibilities in statements 2 and 3 to create effective distractors and test the candidate's precise understanding of the scheme's objectives and implementation.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system in India:**

1.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, with AWWs receiving ₹5000 and AWHs receiving ₹2500.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to digitally strengthen AWCs with smartphones for POSHAN tracking systems and monitoring devices, but does not include early childhood care and education.
3.  AWWs are covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY), Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), and Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided honorarium amounts are not entirely accurate; the actual amounts vary and are subject to change. Statement 2 is incorrect. Saksham Anganwadis explicitly include early childhood care and education as a key component. Statement 3 is correct; AWWs are covered under these insurance schemes. The question uses inaccurate figures for honorarium in statement 1 and a false claim about the scope of Saksham Anganwadis in statement 2 to create strong distractors.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, ranks India among the top 20 countries with the highest hunger levels.
2.  According to the GHI 2023, India's score shows a significant improvement compared to its score in 2015, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger.
3.  The Indian government has raised objections to the GHI methodology, citing issues such as inadequate sample size and inappropriate data sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's ranking in the GHI 2023 places it significantly lower than the top 20, indicating a serious hunger situation. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there might be a slight improvement from 2015, it's not a significant one, and the overall hunger situation remains serious. Statement 3 is correct; the Indian government has consistently raised objections about the GHI's methodology. The question employs incorrect ranking and exaggerated progress claims in statements 1 and 2 as key distractors.


**9.  Consider the following statements regarding Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in India:**

1.  An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented both solid and liquid waste management systems, but does not necessarily display ODF Plus IEC messages.
2.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to achieve ODF Plus status for 100% of Indian villages by 2024.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village is defined by the sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, and plastic waste), and the display of ODF Plus IEC messages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ODF Plus villages are required to display ODF Plus IEC messages. Statement 2 is incorrect. The target year for 100% ODF Plus status might differ from 2024. Statement 3 is correct; it accurately defines an ODF Plus Model village. The question utilizes incorrect requirements for ODF Plus villages in statement 1 and an inaccurate target year in statement 2 as strong distractors.


**10. With reference to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNFPA's mandate includes ensuring sexual and reproductive rights and choices for all, with a focus on achieving "three zeros" by 2030: zero unmet need for family planning, zero preventable maternal deaths, and zero gender-based violence and harmful practices.
2.  The UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023 projects that India will surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2024, and that India will be among the ten youngest countries in the world by 2030.
3.  The UNFPA collaborates primarily with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), but not with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) or the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. This accurately describes UNFPA's mandate and the "three zeros" goal. Statement 2 is partially correct. India did surpass China as the world's most populous country; however, the prediction of India being among the ten youngest countries by 2030 might require further verification. Statement 3 is incorrect. UNFPA actively collaborates with UNDP and UNAIDS alongside WHO and UNICEF. The question uses a slightly imprecise prediction in statement 2 and a false claim regarding collaborative partners in statement 3 to create strong distractors.  The emphasis on specific numerical targets and the list of collaborating agencies increase the difficulty level.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs, with 13 groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes (STs), Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.  Statement 2 is correct; these are the established criteria used by the Indian government to identify PVTGs. Statement 3 is also correct; Odisha officially lists 13 PVTGs. The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall number of STs and the specific number of PVTGs, a distinction crucial for understanding India's tribal demographics and policy approaches.  The inclusion of a seemingly correct but ultimately false statement (1) adds to the complexity and necessitates careful analysis.


**2. With reference to the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 150 million Indians belonging to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed, and this historical context is important for understanding the marginalization faced by DNTs.  Statement 3 is also correct regarding the Renke Commission's estimates. This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced terminology and historical context related to DNTs and nomadic communities in India. The incorrect statement (1) is designed to trap candidates relying on superficial knowledge.  The large number in statement 3 also makes the statement less easily remembered.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs and at least 4% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those caused by acid attacks.
3.  The Act establishes a special court in every district for the faster adjudication of cases under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The percentages are reversed; the act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions. Statement 2 is correct; the Act significantly broadened the definition of disability. Statement 3 is also correct.  The question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the reservation percentages and the breadth of disabilities covered under the RPwD Act. The deliberate inversion of percentages in statement 1 serves as a significant distractor. The inclusion of a seemingly minor detail (special courts in every district) adds to the difficulty.



**4. Consider the following statements concerning the National Policy on Biofuels (2018):**

1.  The policy aims for a 20% ethanol blend in petrol by 2025.
2.  The policy promotes the use of oxygenated fuels to reduce emissions and environmental pollution.
3.  The policy outlines targets for blending biodiesel with diesel fuel as well.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The National Policy on Biofuels (2018) sets a target of 20% ethanol blending in petrol by 2025.  The policy recognizes the environmental benefits of oxygenated fuels like ethanol.  While the emphasis is on ethanol, the policy also addresses other biofuels, including biodiesel. This question assesses the candidate's detailed knowledge of the policy's goals and scope.  The seemingly straightforward nature of the statements requires careful attention to detail to avoid overlooking any subtle inaccuracies.  Knowing the exact target percentage is key.



**5. With reference to the Manual Scavenging and its legal framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment or a fine of Rs. 1 lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste, irrespective of whether they use protective gear.
3.  The PEMSR Act mandates local authorities to construct only sanitary latrines and demolish insanitary ones within a specified timeframe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act makes an exception for those using protective gear. Statement 3 is correct. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavenging and its provisions for sanitation infrastructure. The deliberate inclusion of a partially correct statement (2) makes it challenging to identify the accurate combination.  The legal aspects and penalties involved demand precise knowledge.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and its accreditation:**

1.  The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) accredits the NHRC based solely on its adherence to the Paris Principles.
2.  GANHRI's deferral of the NHRC's accreditation has been related to concerns about political interference in appointments and the NHRC's engagement with law enforcement agencies.
3.  The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Human Rights Act aimed to address GANHRI's concerns about the NHRC's lack of diversity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Paris Principles are a key consideration, GANHRI's assessment involves broader criteria. Statement 2 is correct; these have been cited reasons for deferral. Statement 3 is also correct. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the NHRC's international standing and the factors influencing its accreditation. The partially correct statement (1) and the detailed nature of statements 2 and 3 increase the question's difficulty.  Understanding the interplay between national human rights institutions and international bodies is key.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; while related to sports promotion, the Khelo India movement wasn't launched specifically on National Sports Day. Statement 3 is correct. This question tests knowledge about National Sports Day, its purpose, and associated initiatives. The subtle inaccuracy in statement 2 and the need to recall the specific date make the question challenging.

Statement 3 is correct; the report generally uses a mixed methodology.  The question tests the candidate's awareness of such reports and their evaluation criteria. The deliberately misleading statements are designed to challenge the candidate's knowledge of the report’s scope and methodology.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1. The rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2. Single women (widows or divorcees) undergoing surrogacy must use their own eggs and donor sperm.
3. The rules explicitly permit commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances to address financial hardships of intending parents.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021,  modified the earlier prohibition on donor gametes.  Now, donor gametes are allowed only in cases where the intending couple has a medical condition requiring it, with the stipulation that the child must possess at least one gamete from the intending couple. This reflects a cautious approach towards assisted reproductive technologies while trying to balance the needs of infertile couples.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The rules stipulate that single women opting for surrogacy must utilize their own eggs and donor sperm. This is a key regulatory aspect aiming to maintain a degree of genetic connection between the child and the intending parent.  This provision addresses ethical concerns and regulatory aspects related to single parenthood through surrogacy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, emphasizing altruistic surrogacy.  The 2024 amendments do not alter this fundamental stance.  The Act aims to prevent exploitation of surrogate mothers and uphold ethical standards in reproductive healthcare.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with provisions for trying 16-18-year-olds as adults in heinous crimes.
2. The Act mandates that adoption orders issued by Child Welfare Committees are final and non-appealable.
3. The Act categorizes offenses committed by juveniles into three categories: heinous, serious, and petty offenses, based solely on the severity of the crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The JJ Act, 2015, defines a child as someone below 18, but includes a crucial provision allowing for the trial of 16-18-year-olds as adults in cases involving heinous crimes.  This provision reflects a complex balancing act between the rights of the child and the need for justice in serious offenses.  The assessment process to determine whether a child should be tried as an adult or juvenile is a critical aspect of the Act's implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2021 amendment to the JJ Act introduced provisions for appeals against adoption orders issued by District Magistrates, altering the earlier provision of finality.  This demonstrates the evolving legal landscape surrounding child adoption and the mechanisms for redressal.  The amendment reflects a greater emphasis on judicial oversight and the possibility of reviewing adoption orders under certain circumstances.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the Act does categorize offenses, the categorization isn't solely based on the crime's severity.  The assessment also considers the child's age, circumstances of the offense, and other factors.  The classification is a nuanced process, not a simple metric based on punishment length. The criteria for classifying offenses are more complex than simply the length of possible imprisonment.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 mandates a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of 100% in higher education by 2030.
3.  NEP 2020 proposes the establishment of a National Research Foundation (NRF) to enhance research and innovation in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NEP 2020 fundamentally reshapes the school education structure, proposing a 5+3+3+4 age-based design instead of the previous four-stage model. This restructuring aims to create a more holistic and developmentally appropriate learning pathway.  The shift emphasizes foundational learning and aligns with global best practices in early childhood care and education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NEP 2020 targets a 50% GER in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030. The policy aims for significant expansion of access to higher education, but this is a phased and ambitious goal, not a target achievable within the short timeframe mentioned.  The 50% target itself represents a substantial increase from the existing GER.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of the NRF is a cornerstone of NEP 2020's vision to foster a strong research ecosystem in India. The NRF aims to streamline funding, promote interdisciplinary research, and bolster India's global competitiveness in scientific and technological advancements.  The creation of the NRF is a significant policy initiative to address gaps in research infrastructure and funding.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI is jointly published annually by the World Food Programme (WFP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
2. The 2023 GHI ranked India among the countries with the highest hunger levels, categorized as "Serious" on the hunger severity scale.
3. The GHI methodology solely relies on data from national government sources to ensure objectivity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is not published by the WFP and FAO.  It is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe. The GHI is an independent assessment, not directly affiliated with UN agencies, although it utilizes data from various sources, including those from UN agencies.  It's crucial to understand the different organizations involved in hunger-related data and assessments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 2023 GHI indeed placed India among countries with high hunger levels, categorizing its hunger severity as "Serious".  While the ranking and classification are subject to ongoing debate and scrutiny regarding methodology, the core finding of the report remains that India faces substantial hunger challenges.  The GHI score provides a benchmark for measuring progress in tackling hunger.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI methodology incorporates data from multiple sources, not solely from national governments. This multi-source approach aims to provide a more comprehensive and robust assessment of hunger.  The inclusion of diverse data sources helps to mitigate potential biases from individual national reporting mechanisms.  The methodology is transparently explained, and the data sources are publicly available.



**5. Consider the following statements about the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE):**

1.  The NCF-SE, 2023, proposes a move to a semester system instead of an annual examination pattern for all grades.
2. The NCF-SE, 2023, mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.
3. The NCF-SE, 2023,  completely eliminates the distinction between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The NCF-SE does propose a move towards a semester system in higher grades, but it doesn't mandate it for all grades.  The transition to a semester system is a gradual process, and not immediately applicable to all grades. The framework outlines the desired shift, but implementation is likely to be phased.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCF-SE strongly advocates for multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian. This promotes linguistic diversity and aims to strengthen the use of mother tongues in education. This policy reflects a commitment to preserving and promoting India's rich linguistic heritage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE doesn't eliminate the distinction between academic and vocational subjects entirely. It aims to reduce the rigid separation between them, promoting greater flexibility and integration to allow students to explore various subjects and interests. The framework aims to create more integrated and flexible learning pathways, rather than a complete merger of academic and vocational streams.  The goal is to create more options and pathways.


**6. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a manual scavenger as anyone employed to handle any un-decomposed human waste, regardless of the tools used.
2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment opportunities, financial assistance, and property acquisition support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of a manual scavenger excludes those who handle human waste using appropriate protective gear and equipment.  The Act aims to prevent hazardous manual handling of human waste, not simply the act of waste removal itself. The use of appropriate safety measures is a crucial distinction in the legal definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act doesn't mandate the immediate demolition of all insanitary latrines.  It requires the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, allowing for a phased approach. The approach aims for a gradual elimination of insanitary latrines, acknowledging the practical challenges involved in a large-scale conversion.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act includes comprehensive provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  This includes providing training for alternate employment, offering financial assistance, and aiding in property acquisition. The rehabilitation aspect is a crucial component of the Act, aiming to empower manual scavengers and provide them with sustainable livelihoods.  The aim is to provide a pathway to dignity and a better life.


**7. With reference to the  Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the state governments, with no central guidelines.
2. The Anganwadi system is primarily concerned with improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used by AWWs to dynamically identify malnutrition prevalence among children and track nutrition service delivery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While state governments may provide additional honorarium, the central government sets a minimum fixed monthly honorarium for AWWs. The central guidelines establish a baseline, though states may supplement this amount.  The central government plays a key role in setting compensation standards for AWWs nationwide.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary goal of the Anganwadi system is to enhance the nutritional and health status of the target population.  The system aims to address malnutrition and improve overall health outcomes through a combination of nutritional supplements, healthcare services, and early childhood development initiatives.  The core objectives are focused on improving well-being.

Statement 3 is correct. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool used by AWWs for real-time monitoring and data collection related to nutrition.  The app facilitates dynamic identification of malnutrition cases and efficient tracking of services, improving the effectiveness of nutrition programs.  The app is a critical part of modernizing the Anganwadi system.


**8. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey (NFHS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NFHS is a large-scale, multi-round survey conducted every five years to collect data on various health indicators.
2. The NFHS is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) solely using its internal data collection mechanisms.
3. NFHS-5 data provides insights into various health indicators such as maternal and child health, nutrition, and family planning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NFHS is a large-scale, nationally representative survey conducted periodically to collect comprehensive data on health and related indicators.  The multi-round nature of the survey allows for tracking trends over time and assessing the effectiveness of health programs.  The survey's design and methodology are rigorous, ensuring data quality and reliability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NFHS is not conducted solely by the MoHFW using its internal mechanisms.  It involves a collaborative effort with various state health departments and external agencies to ensure data collection across different regions and settings.  The data collection process is complex and involves many partners.

Statement 3 is correct.  NFHS data provides valuable insights into a wide range of health indicators.  These include maternal mortality rates, child health outcomes, nutrition levels, and family planning practices. The data is used for evidence-based policymaking and program design. The data is widely used by researchers, policymakers, and other stakeholders.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, assesses the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women across four dimensions: political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
2. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), jointly released by the WHO and World Bank, tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes indicators related to reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access.  India's 2021 score was lower than its 2019 score.
3. The Path to Equal Report, jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, introduced the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI), focusing solely on women's power and freedoms, and the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI), evaluating women's status relative to men.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the described indices.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the four dimensions assessed by the Gender Social Norms Index. Statement 2 accurately describes the UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI), its purpose, the indicator categories it encompasses, and the fact that India's score declined between 2019 and 2021. Statement 3 correctly outlines the two indices introduced by the Path to Equal Report, the WEI and GGPI, and their respective focuses.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of recognized PVTGs in India.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively located in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The government uses these four criteria to identify PVTGs, reflecting their unique vulnerabilities and need for focused support. Statement 2 is also correct; Odisha has the largest number of recognized PVTGs. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating a geographical spread across these two states.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the specific criteria used to define PVTGs and their distribution across Indian states.  The inclusion of statement 3, which is partially incorrect, serves as a crucial distractor, requiring careful analysis of the provided information.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
2.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
3.  August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed, marking a significant shift in policy towards these marginalized communities. Statement 3 is also accurate; August 31st is commemorated as Vimukta Jatis Day. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The relationship is that all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are categorized as DNTs.  The question assesses factual recall of historical legislation and contemporary observances related to DNTs. The inclusion of the partially incorrect statement 2, along with the seemingly correct statements 1 and 3, makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between subtle nuances of information.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning government initiatives for the welfare of DNTs:**

Statement 2 is correct. The rules stipulate that single women opting for surrogacy must use their own eggs and donor sperm. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and subsequent rules strictly prohibit commercial surrogacy, promoting altruistic surrogacy instead. The correct option highlights the key changes introduced by the 2024 amendment, clarifying the permissible conditions for using donor gametes and the stipulations for single women seeking surrogacy.  The exclusion of commercial surrogacy underscores the ethical considerations governing the practice.


**9. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, consider the following statements:**

1. The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks for all women on the advice of one doctor.
2.  Termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks is permitted only in cases of foetal abnormalities, on the advice of a medical board.
3. The Supreme Court, in 2022, ruled that marital rape is not considered rape for the purposes of the MTP Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amended MTP Act allows termination up to 20 weeks for all women based on one doctor's advice;  beyond 20 weeks, specific criteria apply, and two doctors' opinions are needed in many cases. Statement 2 is correct.  Termination beyond 24 weeks is exceptionally permitted due to severe foetal abnormalities, requiring a medical board's assessment. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in 2022, explicitly stated that for the purposes of the MTP Act, marital rape *is* considered rape, expanding access to safe abortion. The correct option demonstrates an accurate understanding of the amended MTP Act's provisions concerning gestational limits and the Supreme Court's crucial clarification on the definition of rape within the context of the Act.



**1. With reference to ODF Plus villages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems but not necessarily liquid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus Model village necessitates visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater,  in addition to sustained ODF status and both solid and liquid waste management systems.
3. The ODF Plus Model village criteria include the display of ODF Plus Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) messages, but not necessarily visual cleanliness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While sustained ODF status is a requirement for ODF Plus villages, the definition explicitly states that *either* solid *or* liquid waste management systems must be implemented, not necessarily both.  The definition given in the source material clearly states both are needed to be an ODF Plus *Model* village.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately reflects the criteria for an ODF Plus Model village as described: sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, no plastic waste), and display of IEC messages.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Visual cleanliness is a crucial component of the ODF Plus Model village criteria, as explicitly stated in the provided text.


**2. With reference to the UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The report indeed projects India to surpass China's population by mid-2023,  with a population exceeding 1.4 billion (The exact figure provided in the text is 1,428.6 million).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report indicates that India's total fertility rate has *decreased* to 2.0 from 2.2 in 2015-16, showing a decline, not stagnation.

Statement 3 is correct. This accurately reflects one of the key findings of the report regarding the projected distribution of global population growth by 2050.


**3. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based schooling structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.

3. The NCF-SE introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as either "Accredited" or "Not Accredited."


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE does propose a shift to a 5+3+3+4 age-based schooling structure, a key feature of the NEP 2020.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least *three* languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  The number 4 is a distortion.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage describes a binary accreditation system for *Higher Education Institutions*, not schools.  The NCF-SE does not directly address school accreditation in this manner.


**4. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 representing higher education.
2.  The NCrF establishes a system where credits earned through experiential learning, such as industry experience, can be counted towards academic qualifications.
3. The NCrF mandates that all credits earned must be stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) system to ensure seamless transfer.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCrF divides education into eight levels, but levels 1-4 represent *school* education, not higher education.  Higher education is represented by levels 4.5-8.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the NCrF is its inclusion of credits earned through various forms of learning, including experiential learning from industries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCrF promotes the use of the ABC system, it doesn't mandate that *all* credits *must* be stored there.  The system is designed for flexibility and doesn't make storage compulsory.


**5. With reference to the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs, released in 2023, classified States/UTs into ten grades, with "Daksh" being the highest and "Akanshi-3" the lowest.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The PGI 2.0 report did indeed classify States/UTs into ten grades using the described grading system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGI-D report utilized data from both UDISE+ and NAS 2021, not solely UDISE+.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The report explicitly states that *no* States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") and that some were in the lowest grade ("Akanshi-3"), making it impossible for all to achieve at least "Prachesta-1".


**6. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBU) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The UGC (Institutions Deemed-to-be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to supply chain disruptions, the report highlights that the surge in food prices was also significantly influenced by the Russia-Ukraine war and other factors.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report does project a substantial increase in undernourishment due to climate change by 2050.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report explicitly states that food insecurity has *increased*, not decreased, during the period 2020-2022 due to multiple crises.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has a significant ST population, it does not hold the largest in absolute numbers.  The statement conflates the overall ST population with the PVTG population.  Odisha holds the distinction of having the highest number of PVTGs. Statement 2 is correct; Odisha houses the most PVTGs. Statement 3 is also correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs as listed are accurate and reflect the government's official guidelines.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; DNTs represent a subset of nomadic tribes.  The relationship is not reciprocal. Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  Statement 3 is also correct; August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**3.  With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

3. Safal karamcharis, working as sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities, are not considered manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act does not mandate the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe; it sets a timeline but allows for extensions and phased implementations.  Statement 2 is correct. The definition of manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act accurately reflects the description provided. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Safal karamcharis, depending on their tasks and the tools they use, can fall under the definition of manual scavengers if they handle human waste without appropriate safety equipment. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF aims to integrate credits across different educational streams using an eight-level system. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCrF promotes the use of the ABC, it does not mandate that *all* credits must be stored there; it provides a flexible system. Statement 3 is correct.

2.  The index includes parameters such as Economic Participation and Opportunity, Educational Attainment, Health and Survival, and Political Empowerment.
3. In 2023, India's rank was 147 out of 156 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is published annually, not biennially, by the World Economic Forum.  Statement 1 is therefore incorrect. Statement 2 accurately reflects the four key parameters used in the GGGI.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the provided text states India's rank was 127 out of 146 countries in 2023,  the question manipulates the numbers to create a distractor. The precise ranking can fluctuate slightly depending on the methodology and the number of countries included in a given year's report.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The other statements contain factual inaccuracies designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the index and their ability to identify misinformation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI) is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Bank, making statement 1 incorrect. The GSNI focuses on four dimensions (Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity), not five as suggested in statement 2, rendering statement 2 incorrect. While statement 3 correctly lists three of the four dimensions, the addition of "Social Participation" is incorrect. The question uses plausible but inaccurate information about the index’s source and composition to test the candidate's understanding of the GSNI. None of the statements are fully correct.

**3.  With reference to the UHC Service Coverage Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks SDG target 3.8.2.
2. The index includes indicator categories such as reproductive, maternal, and newborn health; infectious diseases; non-communicable diseases; and service capacity and access.
3.  India's score in 2021 was 62.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UHC Service Coverage Index (SCI) tracks SDG target 3.8.1, not 3.8.2, making statement 1 incorrect. Statement 2 accurately describes the four indicator categories included in the SCI. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the text states India's score in 2021 declined to 63 from 64 in 2019.  The question uses a slight alteration of the correct score to act as a distractor.  Only statement 2 provides entirely accurate information.  The other statements contain subtle, yet significant, factual errors designed to challenge the candidate’s understanding of the index and data interpretation skills.

**4. With reference to the Path to Equal Report, consider the following statements:**

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Path to Equal Report is a joint publication of UN Women and the UNDP, not the World Bank. Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the content of the report, which does indeed introduce the WEI and GGPI, and the GGPI's focus on comparing women's and men's status in human development.  The question uses the incorrect collaborating organization to mislead the candidate. Only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

**5. With reference to the Commission for Scientific and Technical Terminology (CSTT), consider the following statements:**

1. The CSTT was established in 1960 under Article 344(3) of the Constitution of India.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the CSTT's objective and its scope concerning Indian languages. Statement 3 is incorrect; the provided text does not specify the ministry under which the CSTT operates.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the CSTT's establishment details and its operational aspects. Only statement 2 is fully accurate.


**6. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups (3-8, 8-11, 11-14, 14-18), a departure from the previous four-stage system.  This restructuring aims to create a more holistic and flexible learning pathway.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The framework strongly emphasizes multilingualism, aiming to develop proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on including at least two Indian languages. This reflects a commitment to preserving and promoting India's linguistic diversity.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  NCF-SE explicitly advocates against rigid separations between academic and vocational streams at the secondary level.  Instead, it promotes flexibility and choice, allowing students to blend academic and vocational learning to suit their individual interests and aptitudes.  The aim is to create a more integrated and relevant educational experience.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGI-D report, combining data from 2020-21 and 2021-22, assesses school performance exclusively based on UDISE+ data.
2.  In the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, several states achieved the highest grade of 'Daksh'.
3.  PGI assesses school education system performance at the state and district levels, using data from UDISE+ and NAS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PGI-D report uses UDISE+ data, it also incorporates other crucial aspects like effective classroom transactions and school safety, demonstrating a more comprehensive evaluation than solely relying on UDISE+.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 report explicitly states that *no* states/UTs achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in 2021-22.  This highlights the challenges in achieving top performance across all assessed parameters.

Statement 3 is correct. The core function of PGI is to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both state and district levels.  This is achieved by utilizing data from two key sources: the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS).  These data sources provide a multi-faceted view of the educational landscape.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCrF explicitly includes credits earned through experiential learning, such as relevant experience and proficiency levels acquired from industries. This inclusive approach recognizes the value of diverse learning pathways.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCrF divides education into eight levels, but levels 1-4 specifically refer to school education, not higher education. Levels 4.5-8 represent higher education.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the framework's structure.

Statement 3 is correct. A key goal of the NCrF is to foster lifelong learning.  It achieves this by establishing a credit transfer mechanism that allows students to enter, exit, and re-enter the education system at various points in their careers, promoting flexibility and adaptability.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, mandate that institutions must be at least 20 years old to apply for DTBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DTBU status are prohibited from introducing new courses or programs without the approval of the Central Government.
3.  The UGC Act, 1956, empowers the Central Government to grant DTBU status to institutions other than universities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations *reduce* the minimum age requirement for applying for DTBU status; institutions less than 20 years old can now apply. This change aims to encourage the growth of high-quality institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Executive Council approval is necessary for new courses,  the statement incorrectly suggests that Central Government approval is always mandatory.  The regulations provide for flexibility depending on the nature of the course and relevant statutory council approvals.

Statement 3 is correct.  The UGC Act, 1956, provides the legal basis for the Central Government's authority to bestow DTBU status upon institutions that meet the specified criteria. This empowers the government to expand access to higher education through diverse institutional models.


**5. With reference to the  National Medical Commission (NMC) and related Acts, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, seeks to repeal the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, and aims to improve access to quality and affordable nursing education.
2. The National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023, introduces a National Exit Test for dentists, similar to the NEET for medical graduates, but does not seek to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948.
3. The NMC is a statutory body under the NMC Act, 2019, and its accreditation by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) ensures all existing and new medical colleges will be automatically accredited for the next 10 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NNMC Act, 2023, aims to replace the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, with a more modern and effective regulatory framework.  A key objective is to enhance access to high-quality nursing education and address the shortage of nurses in many parts of India.

Statement 2 is partially correct, but misleading. The NDC Act, 2023, does introduce a national exit test for dentists but it *does* seek to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948, replacing it with a new regulatory structure.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMC is indeed a statutory body under the 2019 Act.  The WFME accreditation provides a significant boost to the credibility of medical education in India, ensuring automatic accreditation for existing and new medical colleges for a 10-year period.  This simplifies the accreditation process and enhances international recognition.

1.  The GHI is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2.  The GHI considers four indicators: undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score has consistently improved over the past decade, reflecting significant progress in reducing hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is not released by the UNDP. It is published annually by the Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI uses four key indicators to assess the level of hunger in a country: undernourishment (the proportion of the undernourished population), child wasting (the percentage of children under five who are wasted), child stunting (the percentage of children under five who are stunted), and child mortality (the mortality rate of children under five).

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there might have been some improvements in certain years, India's GHI score has not consistently improved over the past decade.  The score often fluctuates and remains a cause for concern, indicating ongoing challenges in addressing hunger and malnutrition.


**7. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

2.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe after its enactment.
3.  The Act outlines procedures for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including providing alternative employment and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those handling waste from insanitary latrines without protection.  It includes anyone employed to manually handle human excreta from any source, regardless of the presence of protective gear. The exception for those using appropriate gear is crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their demolition within a fixed timeframe.  The process involves a phased approach, prioritizing construction of community sanitary latrines and gradually phasing out insanitary ones.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key component of the PEMSR Act is the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  The Act lays out a framework for providing alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and support in acquiring property, aiming to improve their livelihoods and social integration.


**8. With reference to the  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in all government and private higher educational institutions.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims, and defines 'person with benchmark disability' as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability.
3. The Act establishes special courts in every district to ensure faster adjudication of cases under the Act, and excludes police forces from the reservation mandate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in *government* and *government-aided* higher educational institutions.  The Act does not extend this reservation mandate to private institutions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act indeed recognizes 21 types of disabilities, encompassing a wide range of impairments.  The definition of 'person with benchmark disability' as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability is also accurate.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act provides for the establishment of special courts in every district to expedite the resolution of cases.  The exclusion of police forces from the reservation mandate is also a correct reflection of the Act's provisions.

2. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme, a central sector scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, focuses solely on providing financial aid to families of child labourers.
3. According to Census 2011, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh together account for a significant portion (approximately 55%) of the total working children in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, effectively prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in any occupation and also restricts adolescents (14-18 years) from working in hazardous occupations and processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCLP Scheme aims to rehabilitate child laborers, it does more than just provide financial aid. It also establishes Special Schools/Rehabilitation Centres to provide education and vocational training to rescued children, aiding their transition to a life free from child labor.

Statement 3 is correct. Census 2011 data indicates that these five states (Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh) collectively account for approximately 55% of the total number of working children in India, highlighting the concentration of child labor in specific regions.


**10. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with a provision allowing for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults for heinous offences.
2.  The 2015 Act originally stipulated that adoption of a child is finalized only after a civil court issues an adoption order, and there is no appeal process for orders made by a Child Welfare Committee.
3. The Act categorizes offences committed by juveniles into three types: heinous offences (minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment or more), serious offences (punishment of three to seven years imprisonment), and petty offences (maximum punishment of up to three years imprisonment).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age.  The provision regarding trying 16-18-year-olds as adults for heinous offenses was a significant aspect of the initial legislation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The original 2015 Act had the mentioned provisions regarding adoption finalization and the lack of appeal for Child Welfare Committee orders.  These aspects were later amended.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act did indeed categorize juvenile offences into these three categories based on the severity of the punishment prescribed under the Indian Penal Code or other relevant laws.  This categorization is significant in determining the legal processes involved.



**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage structure.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must achieve proficiency in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. The NCF-SE recommends the elimination of board examinations for Grades 10 and 12, replacing them with continuous comprehensive evaluation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This structure divides schooling into Foundational (ages 3-8), Preparatory (ages 8-11), Middle (ages 11-14), and Secondary (ages 14-18) stages.  This is a significant departure from the earlier structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages, it does *not* mandate proficiency in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.  The framework encourages proficiency in at least three languages, but these can all be Indian languages.  The focus is on preserving and promoting the diversity of Indian languages.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE does *not* recommend the elimination of board examinations for Grades 10 and 12.  Instead, it proposes reforms to make these examinations more flexible and less stressful, allowing students to take them multiple times within a school year and retaining only the best score.  The focus is on reforming the assessment system, not abolishing it entirely.  Continuous and comprehensive evaluation remains a crucial component, but board examinations are not eliminated.

3. The PGI-D report combines data from 2019-20 and 2020-21 and focuses primarily on teacher training and infrastructure assessment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 used data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021, not the previous year's data.  The index relies on the most recent available data to provide an up-to-date assessment of the school education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it's true that no state/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in PGI 2.0,  Punjab and Chandigarh achieved 'Prachesta-2', not 'Prachesta-1', which is a slightly lower grade.  The statement incorrectly states the highest grade achieved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report combines data from 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21.  Furthermore, while teacher training and infrastructure are considered, the PGI-D's focus is broader, encompassing outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety, among other crucial aspects. The statement misrepresents both the timeframe and the scope of the PGI-D report.


**3. With reference to Higher Education in India and the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 40% in higher education by 2035.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NEP 2020 does indeed advocate for a flexible four-year undergraduate degree structure with multiple exit options. Students can earn a certificate after one year, a diploma after two, a Bachelor's degree after three, and an Honours degree after four. This flexibility allows students to tailor their education to their needs and career aspirations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 actually promotes the establishment of *multidisciplinary* education and research universities (MERUs) across the country.  The aim is to foster interdisciplinary collaboration and research, not to restrict universities to single disciplines.  The statement directly contradicts the NEP's vision for higher education.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

**3. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. POSHAN Abhiyan was launched in 2017 with the primary objective of reducing malnutrition in all districts of India by improving the utilization of Anganwadi services.
2. The POSHAN tracker app, used by Anganwadi Workers (AWWs), facilitates real-time monitoring of nutrition service delivery and the identification of malnutrition prevalence among children, but doesn't contribute to overall program efficiency.
3.  The NNM solely focuses on improving the nutritional status of children and pregnant women and does not involve any inter-ministerial coordination or collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while reducing malnutrition is a key objective, the focus is on identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden, not all districts. Statement 2 is incorrect because the POSHAN tracker directly contributes to program efficiency through improved service delivery and targeted interventions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NNM actively involves inter-ministerial coordination and supervision to guide nutrition-related interventions across various ministries. Thus, none of the statements are completely accurate.


**4. With reference to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) aims to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and improved sanitation for all by 2030, but doesn't address hygiene practices.
2. A UNICEF report, titled 'Triple Threat Report', highlighted that India is among the top 20 countries with the highest burden of WASH-related deaths among children under 5, but  does not consider climate and environmental hazards.
3.  The WHO report on the burden of disease attributable to unsafe WASH services indicated that in 2019, improved WASH services could have prevented less than 1% of all deaths globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SDG 6 explicitly includes hygiene as a crucial component of WASH. Statement 2 is also incorrect because the 'Triple Threat Report' does consider climate and environmental hazards as a significant factor contributing to the WASH crisis. Statement 3 is incorrect; the WHO report indicated that improved WASH services could have prevented a significantly higher percentage of deaths (2.5%) globally.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, shows that India has significantly improved its ranking since 2015, indicating a substantial reduction in hunger levels.
2.  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are the regions with the lowest hunger levels according to the GHI 2023.
3.  The Indian government's objections to the GHI 2023 primarily stem from concerns about data accuracy and methodological issues, but not sample size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while India showed slight improvement, it's still categorized as "Serious" and hasn't seen a substantial reduction in hunger levels. Statement 2 is incorrect; South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are regions with the *highest*, not lowest, hunger levels. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Indian government's objections included concerns about sample size, in addition to data accuracy and methodology. Therefore, none of the statements are accurate.


**6. With reference to Open Defecation Free (ODF) status, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems, but not necessarily liquid waste management systems.
2.  To achieve ODF Plus Model village status, visual cleanliness is a mandatory criterion, but arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management are not required.
3.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aimed to achieve 100% ODF status in all Indian villages by September 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; ODF Plus villages require implementation of *either* solid or liquid waste management systems, not necessarily both. Statement 2 is incorrect; ODF Plus Model villages require arrangements for *both* solid and liquid waste management, along with visual cleanliness. Statement 3 is incorrect; the target was to achieve ODF status, not necessarily ODF Plus status, and the target completion date is not specified as September 2023.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**7. With reference to the  Anganwadi Workers' (AWWs) compensation and benefits, consider the following statements:**

1. The central government has enhanced the AWWs' monthly honorarium to ₹5000, and most states/UTs provide additional honorarium from their own resources.
2. AWWs are eligible for a performance-linked incentive of ₹500 per month for using ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan, and are covered under Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana (PMJJBY) and Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana (PMSBY), but not Anganwadi Karyakartri Bima Yojana (AKBY).
3. AWWs are entitled to paid leave and reservation in promotions, but not uniforms or other incentives and awards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the central government has increased the honorarium to ₹4500, not ₹5000.  Statement 2 is incorrect because AWWs *are* covered under AKBY in addition to PMJJBY and PMSBY. Statement 3 is also incorrect; AWWs receive uniforms and are eligible for various incentives and awards.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**8. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system, and mandates that all students must be proficient in at least four languages.
2. The NCF-SE introduces a semester system instead of an annual exam pattern, but doesn't allow for multiple attempts at board examinations.
3. The NCF-SE integrates contributions of Indian scholars from ancient to contemporary times into the curriculum, but doesn't emphasize interdisciplinary areas of study.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the 5+3+3+4 structure is correct, the language proficiency requirement is at least three, not four, languages. Statement 2 is incorrect because the NCF-SE *does* allow for multiple attempts at board examinations. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NCF-SE *does* emphasize interdisciplinary areas of study, particularly at the secondary level.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs, based on UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021, classified all States/UTs into the highest grade (Daksh).
2. The PGI-D combined report for 2020-21 & 2021-22 focuses on effective classroom transactions, but excludes school safety and outcomes as assessment parameters.
3. The reduction in deviation between the maximum and minimum scores obtained by States/UTs in PGI 2.0 indicates an improvement in the equity of educational outcomes across states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; no States/UTs achieved the highest grade (Daksh) in PGI 2.0. Statement 2 is incorrect; PGI-D includes school safety and outcomes as assessment parameters. Statement 3 is partially correct, the reduction in deviation suggests improvement in equity but doesn't directly equate to improvement in educational outcomes.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.



**10. With reference to Higher Education in India and global rankings, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education in India for the age group 18-23 years surpassed 30% in 2021-22.
2.  In the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2024, fewer than 90 Indian universities were ranked, and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore was not among the top-ranked Indian universities.
3.  The QS World University Rankings 2024 ranked IIT Bombay among the top 200 universities globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the GER in 2021-22 was 28.4%, not above 30%. Statement 2 is incorrect; more than 90 Indian universities were ranked, and IISc Bangalore topped the list of Indian universities. Statement 3 is incorrect; IIT Bombay's global ranking in QS World University Rankings 2024 was not in the top 200. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding ODF Plus villages:**

1.  An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems, but not necessarily liquid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus Model village demonstrates visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater, but may lack comprehensive IEC messaging.
3.  The ODF Plus Model village certification requires arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, along with visual cleanliness and ODF Plus IEC messaging.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because an ODF Plus village must have sustained ODF status *and* implemented either solid *or* liquid waste management systems.  The statement implies a stricter condition than what's required.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. While visual cleanliness is a component of the ODF Plus Model village, the statement omits the requirement for both solid and liquid waste management and the display of IEC messages, which are crucial for the Model village status.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the criteria for an ODF Plus Model village: sustained ODF status, arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and ODF Plus IEC messaging.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**2. With reference to the UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous country by late 2024, with a population exceeding 1.43 billion.
2.  India's fertility rate, according to the report, is projected to remain above replacement level (2.1) by 2030, contributing to continued population growth.
3. The report highlights that India's aging population, currently 7% above 65 years, is projected to increase significantly by 2050, posing challenges to social security systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The UNFPA report did indeed project India to surpass China's population, however the timing is slightly off; it happened in mid-2023, not late 2024.   Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report shows India's total fertility rate is *below* replacement level, currently at 2.0 and falling, indicating a slowing population growth rate. Statement 3 is correct. The report does highlight the growing elderly population in India as a demographic shift that will demand increased attention to healthcare and social security provisions in the coming decades. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are substantially accurate.


**3. With reference to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Progress Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates that progress on over 60% of SDG targets is weak, with approximately 40% showing stagnation or regression.
2. The report attributes the slow progress primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, without considering other factors such as climate change or geopolitical instability.
3. The report projects that under current trends, over 500 million people will still be living in extreme poverty by 2030.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is a close approximation but not entirely precise. The report actually states that progress on more than 50% of SDG targets is weak, with progress on 30% stalled or reversed. While not exactly 60%, it's close enough to be considered a plausible but inaccurate distractor.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The report explicitly mentions multiple factors hindering progress, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, biodiversity loss, pollution, and conflict. Statement 3 is largely correct; the report projects that 575 million people will still be in extreme poverty by 2030, a figure close to the statement's claim. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 reflect the report's findings with acceptable degrees of approximation, making them the most likely correct options.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Global Gender Gap Index:**

1. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index annually, assessing gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
2.  The 2023 Index ranked India below 130th out of 146 countries, highlighting significant gender inequality.
3. The Index solely focuses on the status of women, neglecting any comparison to men's status within the same parameters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The World Economic Forum does publish the Global Gender Gap Report annually, using the four parameters listed. Statement 2 is mostly correct; the report did place India below 130th, though the exact rank was 127th. This is a minor discrepancy, serving as a plausible but slightly incorrect distractor. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Index explicitly compares the status of women to that of men, revealing gender gaps across the four parameters.  Only statements 1 and 2 are fundamentally correct.


**5. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Matsya Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), consider the following statements:**

1.  PMMSY aims to increase fish production to 20 million metric tons by 2024, focusing solely on increasing aquaculture production.
2. PMMSY is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying.
3. The scheme includes investments in infrastructure development, such as modern fishing harbors and cold storage facilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMMSY aims to boost fish production, the target was not 20 million metric tons by 2024, and it encompasses both capture fisheries and aquaculture.  The statement provides an incorrect production target and a limited scope of the scheme.  Statement 2 is correct. PMMSY is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry, and Dairying. Statement 3 is also correct. The scheme includes substantial investments in infrastructure to modernize the fisheries sector.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular structure, dividing schooling into four stages based on age groups: Foundational (3-8), Preparatory (8-11), Middle (11-14), and Secondary (14-18).
2.  The framework emphasizes multilingualism, advocating for proficiency in at least three languages, with a minimum of one being a classical language like Sanskrit.
3. The NCF-SE integrates vocational education seamlessly into the curriculum, starting from the preparatory stage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the 5+3+3+4 structure proposed by the NCF-SE and the age groups corresponding to each stage. Statement 2 is partially correct regarding multilingualism, but the requirement is at least two Indian languages, not necessarily including a classical language.  The statement introduces an unnecessary and incorrect constraint. Statement 3 is incorrect. While vocational education is integrated, it is not introduced in the preparatory stage; it begins later in the curriculum. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Anganwadi system:**

1.  Anganwadi workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, with no additional incentives or allowances provided by state governments.
2.  The Anganwadi system primarily focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, excluding pregnant women and lactating mothers.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used by AWWs to monitor nutrition service delivery, but it does not include features for identifying children with malnutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AWWs receive a fixed honorarium from the central government, many state governments also provide additional incentives and allowances.  The statement falsely limits the compensation to only the central government's contribution. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system explicitly targets both children aged 0-6 years *and* pregnant women and lactating mothers. The statement falsely excludes a key beneficiary group. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Poshan Tracker app is designed to help identify children with malnutrition, besides monitoring service delivery. The statement falsely claims a key functionality is absent. Therefore, all three statements are incorrect.


**8. With reference to the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF is primarily funded through grants and loans from the central government, with no provision for private donations or investment income.
2. The NRF's Governing Board is chaired by the Prime Minister, and its members are exclusively drawn from government ministries and scientific institutions.
3. The NRF subsumes the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) and repeals the SERB Act, 2008.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRF Act explicitly allows for funding from various sources, including grants, loans from the central government, private donations, investment income, and existing funds from the repealed SERB Act.  The statement incorrectly limits the funding sources.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister chairs the Governing Board, it includes members from various sectors, including industry, academia, and non-governmental organizations. The statement incorrectly restricts membership to only government entities. Statement 3 is correct. The NRF Act does indeed subsume SERB and repeals the 2008 Act.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines manual scavengers as only those individuals employed to handle un-decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, excluding those working in sewers or septic tanks.
2. The Act mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines but does not hold local authorities accountable for their maintenance and functionality.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and property acquisition but does not include skill development programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers includes those handling human waste from insanitary latrines *and* those working in sewers or septic tanks without proper safety equipment. The statement incorrectly restricts the definition. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act holds local authorities responsible not only for constructing community sanitary latrines but also for ensuring their proper maintenance and functionality. The statement omits a crucial aspect of the Act's provisions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act includes provisions for skill development programs as part of the rehabilitation process for manual scavengers.  The statement omits a key component of the rehabilitation plan. Therefore, all statements are incorrect.


**1. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  UHC aims to ensure that all individuals have access to a comprehensive range of high-quality health services without facing financial hardship, encompassing health promotion, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and palliative care.
2.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana focuses solely on tertiary healthcare interventions, aiming to improve the quality of specialized medical care.
3.  The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC by prioritizing affordability while ensuring equitable access to quality healthcare services for all citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. UHC's core principle is to provide comprehensive, quality healthcare to all, regardless of their ability to pay. This includes the entire spectrum of healthcare services, from preventative measures to end-of-life care.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana (PM-JAY) is a significant initiative towards UHC but doesn't limit its scope to only tertiary care. It aims to address health issues holistically at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  

Statement 3 is correct. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve UHC, emphasizing both affordability and quality of healthcare for all citizens.  The policy recognizes that access to healthcare must be within the financial reach of everyone while maintaining high standards of care.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 2.


**2. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system, a cornerstone of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme, primarily focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme, while expanding upon the Anganwadi system's goals, excludes adolescent girls (14-18 years) from its purview.
3.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, with no additional performance-based incentives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the primary objectives of the Anganwadi system. It’s a crucial component of ICDS, designed to enhance the nutritional and health outcomes of young children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme explicitly *includes* a focus on adolescent girls (14-18 years), particularly in aspirational districts and the North Eastern Region (NER), expanding the scope of services beyond the original Anganwadi program.

Statement 3 is also incorrect.  AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, but they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives, as detailed in the provided text.  The existence of additional incentives from state governments further refutes statement 3.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 2017, POSHAN Abhiyan's primary aim is to eradicate malnutrition completely across India within a decade.
2. The mission primarily utilizes Anganwadi services to achieve its objectives, focusing on improving the utilization of these services to reduce stunting in high-burden districts.
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan operates independently of other government ministries, focusing solely on nutrition-related interventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While POSHAN Abhiyan aims to significantly reduce malnutrition, it doesn't claim complete eradication within a specific timeframe.  The complexity of malnutrition necessitates a long-term, multi-pronged approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  POSHAN Abhiyan heavily relies on Anganwadi services to deliver its interventions and track progress.  Improving the utilization of existing Anganwadi services is a key strategy for reducing malnutrition, especially stunting, in high-burden districts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. POSHAN Abhiyan is designed to coordinate and monitor nutrition-related initiatives across various ministries. It doesn't operate in isolation but works collaboratively with other government bodies to achieve its goals.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) aims to ensure universal access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation services by 2030.
2.  According to UNICEF, inadequate WASH services in healthcare facilities are a significant contributor to India's high neonatal mortality rate.
3.  The ‘Triple Threat Report’ by UNICEF defines the “triple burden” of WASH-related threats as encompassing less than 50% access to basic water or sanitation services, and the highest burden of WASH-attributable deaths among children under five, but excludes environmental hazards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SDG 6 targets universal access to safe and sustainable water and sanitation for all by 2030.  While affordability is a crucial aspect of access, it is not explicitly stated in the core goal of SDG 6.

Statement 2 is also correct.  UNICEF reports have consistently highlighted the link between inadequate WASH services in healthcare facilities and high neonatal mortality rates in India. Poor hygiene and sanitation contribute significantly to infections and complications during childbirth and in newborns.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "triple threat" defined by UNICEF includes not only limited access and high mortality but also high risk from climate and environmental hazards as a significant factor influencing the overall WASH-related burden on children. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully accurate.


**5.  With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023 report indicates that South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa have consistently shown the greatest improvements in reducing hunger levels since 2015.
2.  India's GHI score in 2023 showed a significant improvement compared to its score in 2015, reflecting substantial progress in addressing hunger.
3.  The Indian government's objections to the GHI are based solely on concerns about the data sources used in the index, without considering methodological issues or sample size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 report actually highlights that little progress has been made in reducing hunger in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa since 2015, contrasting with the statement's claim of significant improvements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did improve slightly from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023, this is a marginal improvement, not a "significant" one as the statement suggests.  The improvement is also not reflective of substantial progress in addressing hunger.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian government's objections to the GHI are multifaceted, encompassing concerns about methodological issues, sample size adequacy, and the appropriateness of data sources. The statement oversimplifies the nature of these objections.  Because all three statements are incorrect, the correct option is (a).


**6. With reference to Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF village is defined by the complete absence of visible faeces in the environment and the use of safe sanitation technologies by every household and public/community institution.
2.  ODF Plus status necessitates the sustained ODF status along with the implementation of comprehensive solid and liquid waste management systems.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village, in addition to maintaining ODF status and having arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, must also demonstrate visual cleanliness and display IEC messages, but doesn't require the absence of plastic waste.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the criteria for an ODF village. It emphasizes the absence of visible faeces and the universal adoption of safe sanitation practices across all households and public institutions.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Achieving ODF Plus status demands not only maintaining the ODF status but also implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems, showing a commitment to broader sanitation improvements.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While an ODF Plus Model village does require visual cleanliness and the display of IEC messages, it explicitly mentions the absence of plastic waste dumps in public places as a criterion.  The statement's claim that plastic waste is not a requirement is therefore inaccurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. With reference to the Anganwadi system's digital inclusivity, consider the following statements:**

1.  All Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) are equipped with smartphones and monitoring devices for real-time tracking and efficient service delivery.
2.  The 'Poshan Tracker' app, used by AWWs, facilitates dynamic identification of malnutrition prevalence among children and real-time monitoring of service delivery.
3.  The digital strengthening of AWCs under Saksham Anganwadis primarily aims to improve data collection and monitoring, with minimal focus on enhancing the quality of early childhood care and education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the goal is to digitally strengthen AWCs, the provided text doesn't state that *all* AWCs are currently equipped with smartphones and monitoring devices. The initiative is ongoing and aims to equip two lakh AWCs over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The 'Poshan Tracker' app is designed to assist AWWs in identifying malnutrition and tracking service delivery efficiently.  This dynamic monitoring capability is a key feature of the app.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The digital strengthening of AWCs under Saksham Anganwadis is not solely focused on data; it aims to improve overall efficiency and effectiveness, including enhanced early childhood care and education.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**8. With reference to community health workers at the grassroots level in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) primarily focus on providing curative care and supplies, while Auxiliary Nurse Midwives (ANMs) concentrate on promoting maternal and child health.
2.  ASHA workers' incentives are solely based on a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the central government, with no additional activity-based incentives.
3.  ANMs receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, and their additional incentives are solely determined by state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AWWs focus on early childhood care and development, while ANMs are primarily concerned with promoting maternal and child health, including immunizations. The statement reverses their primary roles.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ASHA workers receive task/activity-based incentives *in addition* to a fixed monthly incentive.  The statement incorrectly states that their incentives are limited to a fixed monthly honorarium.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ANMs receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, but additional incentives can come from both central and state governments, depending on the specific schemes and programs.  The statement incorrectly limits the source of additional incentives to only state governments.  Since all three statements are incorrect, the answer is (a).


**1. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) and is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the state governments, with the Centre enhancing the AWW honorarium to ₹4500 per month.
3. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to digitally strengthen AWCs with smartphones for POSHAN tracking, but excludes early childhood care and education (ECCE) for children aged 3-6 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme under the MoWCD and forms a crucial part of the ICDS program.  Its objective is to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition.

Statement 2 is partially correct but requires clarification. While the central government has increased the AWW honorarium to ₹4500 per month,  the total compensation includes both the central government's contribution and additional honorarium provided by many state/UT governments from their own resources.  Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate in its claim of the *sole* determinant of honorarium being state governments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative explicitly aims to enhance the overall efficiency and effectiveness of AWCs, including strengthening Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children aged 3-6 years, along with early stimulation for children aged 0-3 years.


**2. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is designed to holistically address health needs at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  It's not limited to tertiary care.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ABDM is designed to improve equitable access to quality healthcare by leveraging technology like telemedicine and enabling national portability of health services.  Its scope explicitly includes both public and private healthcare providers.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve UHC and deliver quality healthcare services to all at an affordable cost. This is a central tenet of the policy.


**3. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. POSHAN Abhiyan was launched in 2017 to solely monitor nutrition-related interventions across various ministries, without directly implementing any programs.
2.  The primary objective of POSHAN Abhiyan is to completely eradicate malnutrition in India by improving the utilization of Anganwadi services.
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan aims to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While POSHAN Abhiyan does involve monitoring and supervision of nutrition-related interventions across ministries, it also actively guides and supports the implementation of nutrition-related programs on the ground. It's not purely a monitoring initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The objective of POSHAN Abhiyan is to *reduce*, not completely eradicate, stunting in districts with the highest malnutrition burden.  Complete eradication is an extremely ambitious goal.

Statement 3 is correct.  The mission explicitly aims to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children. This is a core objective clearly stated in its mandate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's GHI score has shown a slight improvement since 2015, it still remains categorized as "serious" in the 2023 report, indicating that hunger levels are still a major concern.  The statement misrepresents the severity of the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WHO and UNICEF.  These are different organizations.

Statement 3 is correct.  South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently feature among the regions with the highest GHI scores, reflecting persistent challenges in hunger reduction.


**5. With reference to Open Defecation Free (ODF) status in India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the absence of visible faeces and the use of safe sanitation technologies are part of the definition, an ODF Plus village also involves implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems. The statement is incomplete.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ODF Plus Model villages require the display of ODF Plus Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) messages as a key criterion.  The statement omits this crucial element.

Statement 3 is correct.  The provided text states that by September 2023, 75% of Indian villages had achieved ODF Plus status under Phase II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).  This fact is accurately reflected.


**6. With reference to the  National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE, released in 2023, maintains the existing four-stage structure of schooling (Foundational, Preparatory, Middle, and Secondary) without any modifications.
2. The NCF-SE recommends that all students be proficient in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. The NCF-SE advocates for increased flexibility and choice at the secondary stage, eliminating rigid separations between academic and vocational subjects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCF-SE introduces a new 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the older four-stage model.  The statement incorrectly asserts the continuation of the old structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE recommends proficiency in at least three languages, but emphasizes that at least two should be Indian languages.  The inclusion of a foreign language is not mandatory.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE promotes flexibility and choice at the secondary level, reducing the rigid distinctions between academic and vocational streams and different subject areas.  This is a core principle of the framework.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NRF does encompass humanities and social sciences, its scope is much broader, including natural sciences, engineering, technology, environmental sciences, health, and agriculture.  The statement significantly underrepresents the NRF's range of disciplines.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister serves as the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board, providing high-level leadership and guidance.

Statement 3 is correct. The NRF Act, 2023, did indeed repeal the SERB Act, 2008, and integrated SERB's functions into the newly established NRF.  This consolidation streamlines research funding.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of manual scavengers in the PEMSR Act is broader, including those employed to handle human waste from various sources such as sewers, septic tanks, and railway tracks.  The statement is too narrow.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act mandates the conversion or demolition of insanitary latrines, but it doesn't set a specific timeframe of one year for this process. The implementation timeline is more flexible.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PEMSR Act explicitly addresses the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training, financial assistance, and support for alternative employment.  This is a key component of the legislation.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act explicitly allows only altruistic surrogacy, strictly prohibiting commercial surrogacy to prevent exploitation. The statement incorrectly permits commercial surrogacy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act does establish the NARTSB to monitor and regulate the surrogacy process.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the ban on surrogacy for foreign nationals was in place before the 2021 Act, the Act continues this prohibition, ensuring that the practice remains within national boundaries.  The statement accurately reflects the Act's stance.


**10. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, by the UN General Assembly.  Its headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents that guide UNHCR's work and define its mandate and responsibilities regarding refugees.  Statement 3 is largely correct.  The UNHCR does operate in over 130 countries (the provided text mentions 137), including India, and its mandate accurately reflects its core functions of protecting refugees' rights and building a better future for displaced populations.  While the phrasing might be slightly different from the source material, the core idea remains true.  Only statement 3 is fully correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act *increased* the gestational age limit for abortion to 24 weeks for *specific categories of women*,  not lowered it to 20 weeks for all women.  The amendment broadened access to safe abortion services for vulnerable groups.

Statement 2 is correct. The MTP Act, as amended in 2021, allows for abortion up to 20 weeks based on the advice of a single registered medical practitioner. This simplification aimed to streamline the process and improve access.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act allows for abortion beyond 20 weeks under specific circumstances, primarily involving substantial foetal abnormalities diagnosed by a medical board. This provision balances the woman's right to choose with the need to protect foetal life in cases of severe medical conditions.  The medical board's assessment ensures a thorough evaluation of the situation before permitting late-term abortion.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP.  While the WFP is a significant player in combating hunger globally, it is not the organization responsible for compiling and releasing the GHI.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score showed a slight improvement from 2015 to 2023, it was not a significant improvement, and India's ranking remained in a concerning range.  The improvement was marginal and doesn't reflect a substantial reduction in hunger.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI methodology incorporates four key indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. These indicators provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger levels in a country.  The weighting of these indicators reflects their relative importance in assessing the nutritional status of a population.

The text does not explicitly state a specific timeframe for the demolition.  The statement adds a detail not present in the source.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly prohibits the employment of individuals for manual scavenging without providing them with the necessary protective gear and equipment. This is a crucial provision aimed at protecting the health and safety of sanitation workers.

Statement 3 is correct. The text confirms that a government report indicates that over 700 districts have declared themselves free from manual scavenging. This reflects the progress made in addressing this issue, though the exact number might be subject to further verification.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Though the NNM also includes pregnant women and lactating mothers, the primary focus is on reducing malnutrition among children aged 0-6 years. This age group is particularly vulnerable to malnutrition, and the program is designed to address their nutritional needs effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly mentions that the Poshan Tracker mobile application is a key tool used by AWWs to monitor nutrition service delivery and identify children who are stunted, wasted, or underweight.  This technology-driven approach is vital to the program's effectiveness.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that the NNM was launched in 2017 to monitor, supervise, and guide nutrition-related interventions across various ministries.  It does not explicitly mention a joint initiative between the two ministries mentioned, suggesting its oversight is broader than that indicated in the statement.  The statement assumes an organizational structure not explicitly confirmed in the source.

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect IFPRI's location, global reach (including its work in India), and its core research mission focused on poverty, hunger, and malnutrition reduction.  The mention of a recent report on rising food insecurity further supports the accuracy of statement 3.  The key takeaway is to carefully examine the founding dates of organizations and their specific mandates.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is also correct.  The NCF-SE emphasizes multilingualism, aiming for proficiency in at least three languages, with a strong preference for at least two Indian languages. This reflects a commitment to preserving and promoting India's linguistic diversity within the education system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE does advocate for a shift towards a more flexible and continuous assessment system, it does *not* mandate a semester system for *all* grades nor does it eliminate annual examinations for Grades 10 and 12 completely. The framework encourages a move away from solely relying on high-stakes annual exams, promoting a more holistic approach to assessment, but it doesn't eliminate annual exams entirely.  The examination pattern for Grades 10 and 12 remains flexible, allowing students multiple attempts, with the best score being retained.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs, released by the Ministry of Education, uses data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021.
2.  In PGI 2.0, all States/UTs achieved at least the 'Prachesta-1' grade, indicating significant progress in school education.
3. The PGI-D report focuses solely on infrastructure development in schools across districts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The PGI 2.0 assessment for States/UTs indeed leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) for the year 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021. These datasets provide crucial information on various aspects of school education, enabling a comprehensive performance evaluation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 report explicitly states that *no* State/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').  Furthermore, while some States/UTs performed well, achieving grades like 'Prachesta-2',  it's inaccurate to claim that *all* States/UTs reached at least 'Prachesta-1'. The index showcases a range of performance levels across different States/UTs.

Statement 3 is false. The PGI-D report's scope is much broader than just infrastructure. While infrastructure is a component, the report also examines crucial aspects like learning outcomes, effective classroom teaching practices, and school safety measures.  It assesses the holistic performance of the school education system at the district level.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.
2.  The policy introduces a rigid, inflexible undergraduate degree structure with no exit options.
3. NEP 2020 proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NEP 2020 sets an ambitious target of achieving a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035. This signifies a significant expansion of access to higher education opportunities, aiming to cater to a larger segment of the eligible population.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 is designed to be flexible.  It explicitly promotes *multiple exit options* within undergraduate programs, allowing students to obtain certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after completing one, two, or three years of study, respectively.  This flexibility caters to diverse learning pathways and individual circumstances.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NEP 2020 advocates for the establishment of MERUs to foster multidisciplinary learning and research.  These universities are intended to integrate different fields of study, encouraging interdisciplinary collaborations and addressing complex challenges across various domains.


**4. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status can automatically start any new course without seeking further approvals.
3.  The NCERT was recently granted DtBU status, enabling it to offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant change introduced by the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, is the reduction of the minimum age requirement for applying for DtBU status from 20 years to less than 20 years.  This opens up opportunities for younger, high-performing institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While DtBUs enjoy greater autonomy, they are *not* permitted to start new courses or programs arbitrarily.  They still require the approval of their Executive Council and, where applicable, relevant statutory councils before introducing new academic offerings.  This ensures that the quality and relevance of the programs are maintained.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCERT's recent acquisition of DtBU status is a landmark event.  This allows the NCERT to expand its role beyond curriculum development, enabling it to directly offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs, thereby significantly enriching the higher education landscape.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, facilitating seamless transfer.
2.  The NCrF operates independently of the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and National Curriculum Framework (NCF).
3. The NCrF aims to create a rigid, inflexible system of credit accumulation and transfer, thereby limiting student choices.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. A core objective of the NCrF is to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across different educational pathways—school, higher education, and vocational/skill training.  This allows for greater flexibility and mobility in a student's educational journey.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF is explicitly designed to *integrate* with the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF.  It aims to create a unified meta-framework that harmonizes the credit systems of these different frameworks, enabling a more cohesive and transferable credit system.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCrF is designed to enhance *flexibility* and *choice* for students. By facilitating credit transfer, it allows individuals to customize their learning paths, enabling them to pursue diverse educational and vocational opportunities throughout their lives.  It aims to create a more dynamic and responsive education system.


**6. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF is primarily focused on research in the humanities and social sciences, excluding STEM fields.
2. The Prime Minister of India serves as the President of the NRF's Governing Board.
3. The Act repeals the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB) Act, 2008, and subsumes SERB into the NRF.

1.  An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems.
2. An ODF Plus Model village must demonstrate visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and no plastic waste in public areas.
3. Achieving ODF Plus status automatically qualifies a village for funding under the National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of an ODF Plus village explicitly includes the maintenance of ODF status alongside the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems. This signifies a higher level of sanitation and hygiene compared to just achieving ODF status.

Statement 2 is also correct.  An ODF Plus Model village goes beyond basic waste management. It requires the demonstration of visual cleanliness, including the absence of significant litter and plastic waste in public spaces. This visual aspect emphasizes a holistic approach to cleanliness and community hygiene.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NAMASTE scheme promotes mechanized sanitation, achieving ODF Plus status doesn't automatically guarantee funding.  The availability of funds and eligibility criteria for specific schemes like NAMASTE are subject to separate guidelines and processes.  ODF Plus status is a significant achievement but not a direct prerequisite for funding under all sanitation schemes.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, shows significant progress in reducing global hunger since 2015.
2.  India's GHI score in 2023 places it in the 'Serious' category on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.
3. The GHI methodology is universally accepted and free from any criticism regarding data sources or sample size.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 report actually highlights *limited* progress in reducing global hunger since 2015.  Several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and climate change impacts, have hindered progress and, in some cases, even reversed gains made in reducing hunger.

Statement 2 is correct. India's GHI score in 2023 indeed places it in the 'Serious' category, indicating a significant challenge in addressing hunger and malnutrition within the country.  The score reflects the prevalence of undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI methodology and data sources have faced criticism from various sources, including the Indian government.  Concerns have been raised regarding the sample size, data sources used, and the methodology's overall applicability to diverse contexts.  These criticisms highlight the need for ongoing refinement and improvement in the GHI methodology.

1.  NCrF aims to integrate credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, ensuring flexibility and mobility.
2.  The NCrF divides education into 10 levels, with levels 1-5 dedicated to school education and levels 6-10 to higher education.
3.  Credits earned through experiential learning, like industrial experience, can be integrated into the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF's core objective is to create a seamless credit transfer system across different educational pathways, enhancing flexibility and student mobility.  This allows students to move between school, higher education, and vocational training programs without losing previously earned credits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 10.  Levels 1-4 represent school education, levels 4.5-8 represent higher education, and vocational education and training span all 8 levels. This structured approach facilitates credit accumulation and transfer across diverse educational streams.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning as a means of earning credits.  Relevant experience and proficiency acquired from industries can be documented and stored in the ABC, adding value to non-traditional learning paths.  This recognition of diverse learning experiences promotes inclusivity and acknowledges the skills gained outside formal educational settings.  The ABC acts as a central repository for all accumulated credits, regardless of their source, making it a crucial component of the NCrF's integrated approach.



**2. With reference to the accreditation of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The University Grants Commission (UGC) is the sole accrediting body for all HEIs in India, granting recognition under the UGC Act, 1956.
2.  The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited), replacing the existing 8-point grading system.
3.  The National Accreditation Council (NAC), envisioned in the NEP 2020, is proposed as a meta-accrediting body, overseeing other accrediting institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UGC plays a significant role in recognizing HEIs, it is not the sole accrediting body. Multiple agencies at the Union and State levels are involved in periodic approvals, assessments, accreditations, and rankings of HEIs.  This highlights the complex and multi-layered nature of the Indian HEI accreditation landscape.

Statement 2 is correct. The K. Radhakrishnan Committee indeed proposed a shift from the existing 8-point grading system used by the NAAC to a binary system of "Accredited" or "Not Accredited." This simplification aims to streamline the accreditation process and provide clearer assessments of HEI quality.  The committee also suggested sub-categories within the "Not Accredited" category to provide more nuanced feedback.

Statement 3 is correct. The NEP 2020 envisions the NAC as a meta-accrediting body.  It would act as an overarching authority, supervising and ensuring the quality and consistency of the independent accrediting institutions. This structure aims to create a more robust and reliable accreditation system for Indian HEIs.  The NAC is one of four verticals of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI).


**3. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC) and related developments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMC is a statutory body under the NMC Act, 2019, and has received WFME recognition for 25 years, ensuring all existing and new medical colleges will automatically receive WFME accreditation for that period.
2.  The NNMC Act, 2023, aims to improve the quality of education in the nursing and midwifery sectors, addressing the shortage of nursing colleges in many Indian districts.
3.  The NDC Act, 2023, seeks to repeal the Dentists Act, 1948, and establish a National Dental Commission to regulate dental education and practice, introducing an exit test for dentists.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMC has received WFME recognition, but for 10 years, not 25.  This recognition from the World Federation for Medical Education is significant, as it ensures that medical colleges in India meet international standards. The automatic accreditation applies only to existing and newly established medical colleges within the 10-year period.  The timeframe is crucial in understanding the extent and duration of the impact of this recognition.


Statement 2 is correct. The NNMC Act, 2023, directly addresses the issue of inadequate access to quality nursing education in India.  The act aims to improve standards, increase the number of nursing colleges, and enhance the overall quality of nursing and midwifery care. The severe shortage of nursing colleges in many districts is a major concern, and this act attempts to rectify the situation.


Statement 3 is correct. The NDC Act, 2023, is a comprehensive reform aimed at modernizing the regulation of dental education and practice. The act introduces a National Exit Test for dentists, similar to the NEET for medical students, ensuring a standardized assessment of competency.  The repeal of the Dentists Act, 1948, indicates a significant overhaul of the existing regulatory framework.



**4.  With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report and related aspects of healthcare in India, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 is conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and provides comprehensive data on various health indicators, including maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate and total fertility rate.
2. The Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India aims to ensure that all individuals have access to quality healthcare services without facing financial hardship, covering the entire continuum of health services.
3. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a flagship scheme under UHC focusing on providing financial protection to the poor and vulnerable for availing secondary and tertiary level of healthcare services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While NFHS-5 does provide data on maternal mortality rate, infant mortality rate, and total fertility rate, it's conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not solely by the ministry.  This collaborative effort ensures the credibility and scope of the survey's data.


Statement 2 is correct. The definition of UHC accurately reflects the global understanding of the concept.  It aims for comprehensive coverage of healthcare services, from prevention to palliative care, without imposing undue financial burden on individuals.  This aligns with international standards and goals for equitable healthcare access.


Statement 3 is correct.  Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a crucial component of India's efforts towards achieving UHC.  It primarily aims to provide financial protection to vulnerable populations, enabling them to access secondary and tertiary healthcare services that might otherwise be unaffordable.  This financial safety net is a key element in improving healthcare access for the poor.


**5. With reference to  the  Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels, using data from UDISE+ and NAS, classifying states/UTs and districts into 12 grades.
2. In the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22, no state/UT achieved the highest grade (Daksh), with Punjab and Chandigarh achieving the topmost grade of Prachesta-2.
3.  The PGI-D report focuses on effective classroom transactions, school safety, and learning outcomes, with all districts in 2020-21 and 2021-22 achieving at least the grade of Prachesta-1.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI uses UDISE+ and NAS data, but it classifies states/UTs and districts into ten grades, not twelve. The grading system reflects a performance scale ranging from the highest grade (Daksh) to the lowest (Akanshi-3).  The number of grades is a crucial detail in understanding the assessment framework.


Statement 2 is correct. This accurately reflects the key findings of the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22, highlighting the absence of any state/UT achieving the highest grade and identifying the top performers. This information is essential for understanding the performance variations across different states/UTs.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report does indeed focus on classroom transactions, school safety, and learning outcomes. However, it's inaccurate to state that all districts achieved at least the grade of Prachesta-1.  In fact, no districts attained the top two grades (Daksh and Utkarsh).  This underscores the significant variations in performance across different districts.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index and other gender-related indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index, released annually by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender equality across four parameters: economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.
2. The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, measures the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women across four dimensions: political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
3. The UHC Service Coverage Index tracks SDG 3.8.1, focusing on reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access, and India's score increased to 63 in 2021 from 64 in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  This accurately describes the Global Gender Gap Index's scope and methodology. The four parameters provide a comprehensive assessment of gender equality across various aspects of life.  Understanding these parameters is key to interpreting the index's findings.


Statement 2 is correct. The description of the Gender Social Norms Index accurately reflects its purpose and scope.  The four dimensions provide a nuanced understanding of the societal factors contributing to gender inequality.  This index provides valuable insights into the root causes of gender-based disparities.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the UHC Service Coverage Index does track SDG 3.8.1 and includes the mentioned categories, India's score *declined* to 63 in 2021 from 64 in 2019, not increased. This indicates a slight worsening in the service coverage related to Universal Health Coverage in India.  The direction of the change is crucial for accurate interpretation.


**7. With reference to the  Vidya Samiksha Kendras (VSKs) and the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR), consider the following statements:**

1. VSKs, housed in the NCERT campus, leverage data and technology to improve learning outcomes, acting as a data repository for various MoE schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NDEAR is indeed under the Ministry of Education and MeitY, the establishment of a centralized helpdesk for grievance redressal is a function of the VSKs, not NDEAR itself. NDEAR provides the technological infrastructure, but the helpdesk is a specific service delivered through VSKs.


Statement 3 is correct.  This accurately reflects the core objectives of VSKs. Real-time monitoring, tracking of student progress, and empowering educators with data are key features of this initiative.  These functions are vital for improving the quality and efficiency of the school education system.  The integration of various data sources enables a comprehensive view of the educational landscape.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  The first recognition of PVTGs was in 1973, under the nomenclature of Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), based on the recommendations of the Elwin Commission.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding 15.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, high literacy rates, and a rapidly growing population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The initial recognition of PVTGs was in 1973 as PTGs, but this was based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961), not the Elwin Commission.  The Elwin Commission focused on tribal welfare more broadly.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs, it is not more than 15; the correct number is 13. Statement 3 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, Odisha holds the distinction of having the highest number of PVTGs.  Statement 2 is correct; these are the established criteria used by the Indian government to identify PVTGs. Statement 3 is accurate, reflecting the official count of PVTGs in Odisha.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall number of Scheduled Tribes and the specific number of PVTGs, a distinction often overlooked. The inclusion of Madhya Pradesh as a high-population state for Scheduled Tribes is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of PVTG distribution.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the key provisions of the PEMSR Act.  The definition of a manual scavenger is broad, encompassing various employment situations.  The Act explicitly addresses the issue of insanitary latrines, mandating their removal and replacement.  Rehabilitation measures, including alternative employment and financial support, are also central to the Act's objectives. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework designed to eradicate manual scavenging.  The multifaceted nature of the Act's provisions and the specific details regarding rehabilitation create a challenging scenario for those with superficial knowledge.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy. Statement 2 is also correct; the NARTSB is a key institutional mechanism established under the Act. Statement 3 is incorrect;  the initial rules under the act did not allow surrogacy for single women using donor gametes, though subsequent amendments might have changed this.  The question tests knowledge of the Act's provisions and its institutional framework.  The incorrect statement regarding single women's access to surrogacy provides a strong distractor, emphasizing the need for precise understanding of the legislation's details.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has a very large ST population, it does not hold the largest *relative* number.  Odisha houses the highest *number* of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), a special category within STs.  The statement incorrectly conflates absolute numbers with relative proportions within the overall ST population across all states.  The text explicitly states that Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in *absolute* numbers, but does not claim it to be the highest in relative terms.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is explicitly identified as the nodal ministry for tribal affairs in India.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GHI does indeed measure undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality, it is released by **IFPRI**, not WFP.  This is a key detail that differentiates correct and incorrect options.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement is vague about the classification scale and incorrect about India's consistent improvement.  The text does not provide enough information to verify this.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI's composite nature and its use in policy-making are accurately described in the text.  This question tests factual recall of the organization associated with the index and avoids making assumptions about trends not supported by the provided text.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, and economic backwardness.
3.  The government of India renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as PVTGs in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, houses the highest number of PVTGs in India (13). While Madhya Pradesh has a significant ST population,  the number of PVTGs within the state is lower than Odisha's.  This is a crucial distinction often missed, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct.  The identification of PVTGs relies on several key criteria, including a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. These factors collectively indicate a high degree of vulnerability requiring specific governmental support.

2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  August 31st is celebrated as Vimukta Jatis Day in India by DNT communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is not that straightforward. While all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, the reverse is not true.  Many nomadic tribes were never designated as "criminal tribes" under the colonial legislation. This highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the historical context and the complexities of tribal classifications.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory law, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  However, the complete removal of the stigma associated with the earlier act has been a long and ongoing process, illustrating the persistent challenges in addressing historical injustices.

Statement 3 is correct.  August 31st is observed as Vimukta Jatis Day by DNT communities.  This specific date is important for demonstrating awareness of the cultural practices and commemorations related to this vulnerable group.  Remembering this date is a test of factual recall.



**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act provides for free education for all children with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18, regardless of the percentage of disability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act does mandate at least 4% reservation in government jobs and 5% in higher educational institutions,  this reservation is explicitly *not* applicable to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs).  This exception demonstrates a critical detail often overlooked, testing the candidate’s ability to grasp the specifics of the legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, significantly expands the definition of disability, recognizing 21 categories, including those resulting from acid attacks.  This inclusive approach reflects a shift towards a more comprehensive understanding of disabilities and the need for inclusive policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act provides free education for children with *benchmark* disabilities (defined as at least 40% of a specified disability) between 6 and 18 years of age.  The specification of "benchmark disability" is a key element often missed, testing the candidate's ability to understand the precise stipulations of the law.  This detail underscores the need for careful reading and precise recall.



**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prescribes a maximum punishment of one year imprisonment or a fine of Rs. 50,000, or both, for violations.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines.
3.  The NAMASTE scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act actually prescribes a significantly harsher penalty for violations: imprisonment up to two years, a fine up to Rs. one lakh, or both.  The discrepancy in the stated penalty demonstrates the importance of precise factual recall regarding the legal framework for combating manual scavenging.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of manual scavengers under PEMSR is broader than just handling undecomposed waste from insanitary latrines. It also includes those employed to clean sewers and septic tanks without proper protective gear, and those working as sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities or other organisations (safal karamcharis).  This broader definition highlights the complexities and varied forms of manual scavenging that the legislation aims to address.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem (NAMASTE) scheme is indeed a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  This collaborative approach reflects the multi-faceted nature of the problem and the need for coordinated governmental action.  Knowing the collaborating ministries is crucial for understanding the policy landscape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE does propose a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing system. This structural change is a core element of the framework, reflecting a shift in pedagogical approaches and aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE advocates for proficiency in at least three languages, not five, with at least two being Indian languages.  The number of languages is a key detail that distinguishes the correct answer from the distractor.  This shows the need for careful reading and attention to numerical information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE does move towards a semester system for grades 10 and 12,  it doesn't mandate this for *all* grades from 1st to 12th. The statement overgeneralizes the scope of the semester system, creating a plausible but ultimately inaccurate distractor.  Understanding the nuances of implementation is vital for a correct response.


**6. With reference to the National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The NRF will be primarily financed through grants and loans from the state governments.

3.  The GHI considers factors such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Bank and the United Nations.  This demonstrates the importance of knowing the precise source of the index, which is frequently tested in UPSC exams.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India’s GHI score showed a slight improvement from 2015 to 2023, it was not a significant improvement.  The term "significantly" is a subjective qualifier that makes this statement incorrect.  This type of question tests the candidate's ability to critically assess the magnitude of change.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI does indeed incorporate indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to assess the severity of hunger in a country.  These are key components of the index, and their understanding is necessary for interpreting the GHI data.



**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1. The principles emphasize the importance of preserving tribal cultures and avoiding the imposition of alien values.
2.  The principles advocate for complete assimilation of tribal communities into mainstream society.
3. The principles strongly recommend against any form of government intervention in tribal affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Panchsheel Principles strongly emphasize respecting tribal cultures and avoiding the imposition of external values. This principle reflects a commitment to cultural preservation and self-determination.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Panchsheel Principles do *not* advocate for complete assimilation; rather, they emphasize respecting tribal identities and autonomy.  This is a crucial distinction, highlighting the need for careful understanding of the underlying philosophy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The principles do not recommend against *all* government intervention but rather caution against over-administration and overwhelming tribal communities with numerous schemes.  A nuanced understanding of the principles is required to avoid this misconception.  The word "any" makes the statement factually incorrect.

2. The NCrF is based on a 10-level credit system, with levels 1-5 representing school education and levels 6-10 representing higher education.
3.  The NCrF mandates that all credits earned must be stored exclusively in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF's primary objective is to create a unified system for accumulating and transferring credits earned across different educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational, and skill-based learning). This promotes flexibility and mobility within the education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF uses an 8-level credit system, not 10.  Levels 1-4 correspond to school education, levels 4.5-8 to higher education, and vocational education and training span all levels. The number of levels is a crucial detail of the framework's structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the ABC is a significant component of the NCrF, designed to store academic credits, it is not the *exclusive* repository.  Other methods of credit storage and transfer may also be used depending on the specific context and institutional arrangements.  The statement oversimplifies the system's flexibility.

1. NFHS-5 data revealed a significant increase in the total fertility rate across all states in India.
2. NFHS-5 data is collected by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and is used to monitor various health indicators.
3. NFHS-5 data includes information on maternal and child health, family planning, and nutrition, but excludes data on sanitation practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While specific fertility rates vary across states, NFHS-5 data generally showed a *decrease* in the total fertility rate in many regions of India, indicating a trend towards smaller family sizes. The statement presents the opposite of the general trend observed.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is responsible for conducting and utilizing the data from the NFHS surveys. The data is crucial for monitoring the health status of the population and informing policy decisions.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 actually placed India in a concerning position, not among the countries with the lowest hunger levels.  India's ranking and score indicate a significant hunger burden.  The statement misrepresents the key findings of the report.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GHI methodology relies on the four indicators mentioned (undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality) to provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger. These indicators are widely recognized as key measures of nutritional status.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there might have been some minor improvements in certain years, India's GHI score hasn't shown consistent improvement since 2015, and the overall trend remains a cause for concern. The statement incorrectly suggests a consistently positive trajectory.


**10. With reference to the  National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF includes only indicators aligned with the global SDG indicators, excluding any India-specific indicators.
2.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and releasing the NIF progress reports.
3.  The NIF and the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) are static frameworks that do not evolve over time.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NIF is designed to incorporate both indicators aligned with the global GIF and additional indicators tailored to India's specific context and needs. This ensures that the framework addresses the country's unique challenges and priorities.

Statement 2 is correct. The MoSPI plays a central role in developing and releasing the NIF progress reports. This reflects the ministry's responsibility for collecting and analyzing data related to the SDGs in India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Both the NIF and the GIF are dynamic frameworks that evolve over time. This evolution is necessary to reflect changing data collection methods, evolving understanding of the SDGs, and emerging policy priorities.  The statement misrepresents the adaptable nature of these frameworks.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs).
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-industrial level technology, high literacy rates, and economic prosperity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, not Madhya Pradesh.  Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, but this doesn't translate to the highest number of PVTGs.  The distinction between Scheduled Tribes and PVTGs is crucial; PVTGs represent a particularly vulnerable subset within the broader Scheduled Tribe population.

Statement 2 is correct. PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961). The name was later changed to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups in 2006.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are exactly the opposite. They include a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, and economic backwardness, not prosperity.  A declining or stagnant population is also a key criterion. These factors highlight the significant vulnerability and challenges faced by these groups.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which designated certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, comprising a total of 150 million Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Many nomadic communities were not labeled as "criminal tribes" and therefore do not fall under the DNT classification.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a deeply discriminatory law, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  However, the social stigma and marginalization associated with the Act continue to affect DNTs even after its repeal.

Statement 3 is correct regarding the Renke Commission's estimates.  It's important to note that these are estimates, and the exact figures might vary depending on the methodology used. The large number indicates the significant population affected by this historical categorization.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act provides for free education only for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-12 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act mandates a 4% reservation in government jobs, this reservation is explicitly *not* applicable to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs).  This exclusion highlights a specific challenge in ensuring inclusive representation within these crucial sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act significantly expanded the definition of disability, recognizing 21 types, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims. This broader definition reflects a move towards greater inclusivity and recognition of diverse needs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities aged 6-18 years, not just 6-12 years.  The extension to age 18 ensures access to secondary education, a crucial step towards empowerment and social inclusion.


**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) prohibits manual scavenging but does not prescribe any punishment for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines and ensure they are functional and hygienic.
3.  Safal karamcharis, who work as sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities, are not considered manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act does prescribe punishments for violations, including imprisonment up to two years, a fine up to one lakh rupees, or both.  The penalties aim to deter the continued practice of manual scavenging, a hazardous and dehumanizing occupation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act emphasizes the crucial role of local authorities in providing safe and hygienic sanitation facilities. This responsibility includes the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines, a key step towards eliminating manual scavenging.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Safal karamcharis, even if working in seemingly safer conditions, are still considered manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act if they handle undecomposed human waste without appropriate protective gear and equipment.  The definition focuses on the nature of the work, not the employment status.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1.  NEP 2020 proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  NEP 2020 aims to increase the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education to 50% by 2040.
3.  NEP 2020 recommends the establishment of a National Assessment Centre, PARAKH, to assess the performance of the school education system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NEP 2020 proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system, moving from a four-stage system to a 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups. This aims to create a more holistic and integrated approach to learning.

1.  The GHI 2023 ranks India among the countries with the lowest hunger levels globally.
2.  The GHI 2023 uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  The Indian government has not raised any objections regarding the methodology or data sources used in the GHI 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 ranks India relatively low, categorizing it as having a "serious" level of hunger.  This ranking reflects concerns about the prevalence of malnutrition and food insecurity in the country.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI uses these four key indicators to provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger levels.  These indicators capture different aspects of malnutrition and its impact on child health and survival.

1.  Anganwadi Centers (AWCs) are digitally strengthened with smartphones for POSHAN tracking systems.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium per month but are not eligible for any performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The digitalization of AWCs through smartphones and the Poshan Tracker app is a key element of modernizing the Anganwadi system.  This technology improves data collection, monitoring, and service delivery.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, *and* they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives. These incentives are designed to motivate and reward effective service delivery.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years is a core objective, Saksham Anganwadis also expand their focus to include adolescent girls (14-18 years) in specific districts and the North Eastern Region, along with early childhood care and education (3-6 years).  This broader approach recognizes the interconnectedness of various aspects of child and adolescent well-being.




**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs (13), not Madhya Pradesh.  While Madhya Pradesh has a significant ST population, the highest number of PVTGs resides in Odisha.  This highlights the importance of differentiating between the overall ST population and the specific categorization of PVTGs within that population.

Statement 2 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs as outlined by the Government of India accurately reflect the characteristics mentioned: pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. These factors signify a high degree of vulnerability and the need for targeted interventions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating its presence across multiple states.  This underscores the complexities of tribal distribution and the need for policies to consider geographical spread when addressing the needs of specific PVTGs.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are Denotified Tribes, but not all Denotified Tribes are nomadic.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labeled certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic communities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between nomadic tribes and DNTs is the reverse: all DNTs were originally nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  The DNT categorization stems from the historical misclassification under the Criminal Tribes Act. This distinction is crucial in understanding the unique vulnerabilities and historical context of DNTs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory piece of legislation, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  However, the social stigma and marginalization associated with the Act continue to affect DNT communities. This highlights the lasting impact of historical injustices on marginalized communities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Renke Commission (2008) did estimate the combined population of DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic communities to be around 15 crore Indians. This substantial figure underscores the significant scale of the issue and the need for comprehensive policies to address their needs.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Act mandates local authorities to construct and maintain community sanitary latrines and demolish insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment, financial assistance, and help with property purchase.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, including those handling human waste from various sources (insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, railway tracks) regardless of whether protective gear is used or not.  The absence of protective gear is a key factor in determining the hazardous nature of the work but is not the sole criterion for defining manual scavenging.

Statement 2 is correct.  PEMSR explicitly mandates local authorities to take proactive steps to improve sanitation infrastructure, including the construction of community sanitary latrines and the demolition of insanitary latrines. This is a crucial aspect of preventing manual scavenging.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act prioritizes the rehabilitation of manual scavengers by providing support for alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and assistance in acquiring property. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a sustainable pathway out of manual scavenging.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2025.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 2025. This reflects a long-term vision for expanding access to higher education.  The timeline is crucial in understanding the phased implementation of the policy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The flexible undergraduate degree structure with multiple exit options is a key feature of NEP 2020, designed to cater to diverse learning pathways and career aspirations.  This flexibility is intended to improve the relevance and accessibility of higher education.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While NEP 2020 advocates for the establishment of MERUs, it does not mandate their establishment across all states by 2025.  The establishment of MERUs is a gradual process, depending on resource allocation and institutional readiness.  This highlights the realistic approach to implementing large-scale educational reforms.



**6. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  The regulations mandate that all DtBUs must create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.
3.  Institutions granted DtBU status can start new courses or programs without any prior approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The term 'PVTGs' replaced 'Primitive Tribal Groups' (PTGs) in 2006, based on the recommendations of the Elwin Committee.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding 15.
3.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-industrial technology, high literacy rates, and a rapidly growing population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The term PVTGs replaced PTGs in 2006, but this was based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961), not the Elwin Committee. The Elwin Committee focused on tribal welfare in a different context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs, it is not more than 15. The correct number is 13.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, *low* literacy rates, and a *declining or stagnant* population, indicating economic backwardness and vulnerability.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual criteria.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1951.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 1,200 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 200 DNTs in India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship is the opposite: All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  DNTs represent a specific subset of nomadic tribes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952, not 1951.  Even a one-year difference in the date makes the statement factually inaccurate for UPSC-level precision.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Renke Commission (2008) estimated nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, not the figures mentioned in the statement.  The numbers provided are close but deviate enough to be considered wrong.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 6% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 20 types of disabilities, excluding intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act guarantees free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 5 and 17.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only

2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed to handle decomposed human waste.
3.  The Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines but does not specify their functionality or hygiene standards.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment and a fine of ₹One Lakh, or both, for violations, not the figures mentioned in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act defines manual scavengers to include those employed to handle *undecomposed* human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, as well as those working as sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities.  The statement limits the definition too narrowly.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines and explicitly states that these should be functional and hygienic. The statement omits this crucial detail.


**5. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report, consider the following statements (Note: This question is hypothetical as the provided text does not contain details of NFHS-5):**

1.  NFHS-5 shows a significant increase in the total fertility rate compared to NFHS-4.
2.  NFHS-5 reveals a decline in the percentage of women using any modern method of contraception.
3.  NFHS-5 highlights a significant rise in institutional deliveries across all states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)  *(This answer is hypothetical and depends on the actual NFHS-5 data;  all statements are likely incorrect based on general trends, but a specific NFHS-5 report would be needed to confirm.)*

**Explanation:**

This question is designed to highlight the importance of consulting the actual NFHS-5 report for accurate data.  Generally, total fertility rates tend to decrease over time,  contraceptive use tends to increase, and institutional deliveries also increase. Therefore, without access to the specific NFHS-5 data, it's safe to assume that all three statements are likely to be incorrect based on overall global and Indian trends.  The question serves as a reminder to rely on verified data sources rather than making assumptions.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

3. The index assesses four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was 127 out of 146, which is indeed below 130.

Statement 3 is correct. The four parameters listed accurately reflect the components of the Global Gender Gap Index.


**7. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCrF divides education into 9 levels, with levels 1-4 referring to school education and levels 5-9 to higher education.
2.  Credits earned through vocational education and training are not integrated into the NCrF framework.
3.  The NCrF does not incorporate the concept of notional learning hours.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 9, with levels 1-4 for school education and levels 4.5-8 for higher education.  The number of levels is a key detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education to ensure flexibility and mobility.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCrF does incorporate the concept of notional learning hours, fixing the total at 1200 hours/year for all educational pathways.  This is a central aspect of the framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, not 6+3+3+4. A single number change makes the statement factually wrong.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE proposes proficiency in at least three languages, not four, with at least two being Indian languages.  The number of languages is a key detail.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE advocates for greater flexibility and choice, it does not completely eliminate the separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary stage; it aims to blur the lines, not completely erase them.


**9. With reference to the  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 targets a GER of 50% in higher education by 2035, not 100% by 2030.  The 100% target is for preschool to secondary levels.

Statement 2 is correct. The NEP 2020 does indeed propose a new 5+3+3+4 structure, reorganizing the schooling system to better align with cognitive development stages.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While NEP 2020 advocates for improved assessment methods, it does not mandate a single national board for all school examinations.  The policy allows for a degree of flexibility and autonomy at the state and local levels.

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using a system of eight levels.
2.  The NCrF allows for the accumulation of credits through experiential learning, such as industry experience.
3. The NCrF mandates that all credits earned must be stored exclusively within the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) digital platform.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCrF's core aim is to create a unified system for credit accumulation and transfer across different educational pathways.  This is accurately reflected in statement 1, which correctly identifies the eight-level structure for credit integration.  Statement 2 is also true; the NCrF explicitly acknowledges and incorporates credits earned through various forms of experiential learning, including industry experience and other forms of practical skill development. This flexibility enhances the framework's inclusivity and real-world applicability.  Statement 3, however, is false. While the NCrF aims to integrate credits from various frameworks like NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF, it does not mandate the exclusive use of any single digital platform.  The Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) is a key component for storing and managing these credits, but it's not the sole repository as implied in statement 3. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs):**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DTBU status.
2.  The new DTBU regulations mandate that all DTBUs must offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in all disciplines.
3.  The regulations require DTBUs to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; the 2023 regulations relaxed the age requirement, enabling younger institutions to seek DTBU status.  Statement 3 is also correct; the regulations mandate the creation of ABC identities and the uploading of credit scores, promoting credit transferability and student mobility.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The regulations don't impose a requirement for DTBUs to offer programs across *all* disciplines.  DTBUs retain a degree of autonomy in deciding their program offerings, subject to relevant approvals and adhering to quality standards. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct.


**5. With reference to the accreditation of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Dr. K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited) for HEIs.
2. The committee proposed a composite assessment system (CAS) that merges program and institutional accreditation.
3.  The National Accreditation Council (NAC), envisioned in NEP 2020, will be responsible for accrediting individual HEIs, not overseeing other accrediting bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations for HEI accreditation indeed included a shift towards a binary system, simplifying the process and enhancing clarity. This supports statement 1. The committee also advocated for a composite assessment system (CAS) integrating program and institutional accreditation for a more streamlined and holistic evaluation. This is consistent with statement 2.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NAC is envisioned as a meta-accrediting body, responsible for overseeing and supervising the entire accreditation ecosystem, not just accrediting individual institutions directly.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the committee's recommendations.


**6. With reference to the  National Medical Commission (NMC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NMC is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019, and is responsible for overseeing medical education and practice in India.
2. The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) recognition granted to the NMC ensures that all existing and new medical colleges in India will automatically receive WFME accreditation for the next 10 years.
3. The NMC's primary function is to conduct entrance examinations for medical colleges, ensuring uniform standards across the country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the NMC's role and legal basis.  Statement 2 is also largely accurate in that the WFME recognition significantly streamlines the accreditation process for Indian medical colleges, providing a pathway for automatic accreditation for both existing and newly established institutions for a 10-year period. However, the statement oversimplifies the process; it doesn't imply completely automatic accreditation without any further requirements.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the NMC sets standards, it doesn't directly conduct entrance examinations for all medical colleges.  Entrance exams are largely managed by individual colleges or other designated bodies.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fundamentally correct, though statement 2 needs a nuanced understanding.


**7. Consider the following statements about the  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR):**

1. NDEAR is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).

3. The VSKs leverage data and technology to improve learning outcomes and provide a centralized helpdesk for grievance redressal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; NDEAR is a collaborative effort between MoE and MeitY.  Statement 3 is also accurate; VSKs utilize data and technology for improved learning outcome monitoring and establish a centralized helpdesk system for addressing grievances within the school ecosystem.  Statement 2 is incorrect; VSKs are not solely focused on financial tracking; their role is broader, encompassing monitoring various projects, tracking student enrollment and learning outcomes, and facilitating data-driven decision-making at the state level.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately depict the functions and structure of NDEAR and VSKs.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2023 NIRF rankings did indeed introduce a new category for Agriculture & Allied Sectors, reflecting the growing importance of this sector.  This confirms statement 1.  Statement 3 is also correct; the innovation ranking was integrated into the NIRF framework. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While NIRF uses quantitative data, it also incorporates qualitative aspects and perception-based metrics in its assessment, creating a more holistic ranking system than simply relying on numerical data.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) Report:**

1. NFHS-5 data revealed that the total fertility rate in India has decreased significantly since the previous survey.
2. NFHS-5 data showed a substantial increase in the prevalence of stunting among children under five years of age compared to previous surveys.
3. NFHS-5 collected data on various health indicators, including maternal mortality rate, immunization coverage, and access to sanitation facilities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NFHS-5 data did indicate a decline in the total fertility rate, reflecting progress in family planning initiatives. This supports statement 1.  Statement 3 is also correct; NFHS-5 covered a wide range of health indicators, providing valuable insights into various aspects of the health landscape.  However, statement 2 is generally incorrect. While NFHS-5 did provide data on child stunting, it did not show a *substantial increase* compared to previous surveys; the trend varies across regions and requires a more nuanced interpretation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are broadly accurate.


**10. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GGGI is released annually by the World Economic Forum.
2. The GGGI measures gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
3. India's ranking in the 2023 GGGI reflects a significant improvement in gender equality compared to the previous year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the publisher of the GGGI. Statement 2 also accurately lists the four key parameters used in the index's calculation.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the exact ranking fluctuates annually,  India's GGGI ranking typically does not show significant year-on-year improvements; it often remains relatively stagnant or fluctuates within a narrow range, indicating the persistent challenges in achieving gender equality.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are consistently accurate.


**1. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all organizations with more than 50 employees.
2.  A complaint under the POSH Act must be filed within six months of the incident, with no provision for extension.
3.  The ICC can recommend monetary settlements as a means of conciliation between the aggrieved woman and the respondent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 50.  The Act allows for the ICC to extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond three months, depending on the circumstances.  Crucially, the POSH Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation.  The focus is on redressal through disciplinary action against the perpetrator and measures to prevent future occurrences, not financial compensation.  This highlights the legal framework's emphasis on justice and preventing recurrence rather than simply offering monetary appeasement.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 16 years of age.
2.  The Act categorizes offences committed by juveniles into heinous offences, serious offences, and petty offences based solely on the potential punishment under the Indian Penal Code.
3.  Appeals against orders made by a Child Welfare Committee under the Act are always allowed to the High Court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The Juvenile Justice Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, not 16. While the Act does categorize offenses, the categorization is not solely based on the IPC punishment; other factors might be considered.  Furthermore, the appeal process for Child Welfare Committee orders varies depending on the nature of the order and may not always lead to the High Court.  The amendment Act of 2021 introduced some changes to the appeal process, making it more complex.  This underscores the evolution of the legal framework and the importance of understanding its current provisions.



**3. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act permits commercial surrogacy for both Indian and foreign nationals.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to regulate surrogacy practices.
3.  The Act mandates the mandatory involvement of a surrogate mother in the abortion decision of the surrogate child irrespective of gestational age.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, strictly prohibits commercial surrogacy and restricts it to altruistic surrogacy for Indian couples only.  The establishment of the NARTSB is a core feature of the Act, aimed at overseeing and regulating the surrogacy process. However, the statement that a surrogate mother's involvement in abortion decisions is mandatory regardless of gestational age is incorrect.  The Act allows for abortion only under specific conditions and with the consent of the surrogate mother, but not necessarily for the entire pregnancy.  Understanding the nuances of surrogacy legislation requires careful attention to the definitions and restrictions imposed by the Act.


**4. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

3.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through training and financial assistance but not property assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those employed to clean insanitary latrines; it includes those working in sewers and septic tanks as well. The Act mandates the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines in both urban and rural areas to prevent the practice of manual scavenging.  The Act also provides for rehabilitation, which includes not only training and financial help but also assistance in acquiring property.  The comprehensive nature of the Act aims at both preventing the practice and rehabilitating those affected, demonstrating a commitment to both preventive and remedial measures.


**5. With reference to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a transgender person as someone whose gender identity matches their assigned sex at birth.
2. The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the central government on policies and programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Act defines a transgender person as someone whose gender identity differs from their assigned sex at birth, not the same. The establishment of the National Council for Transgender Persons is a key provision of the Act.  The Act mandates inclusive education and also includes opportunities for sports, recreation, and leisure activities for transgender persons in educational institutions. The Act's provisions reflect a comprehensive approach to protecting the rights and ensuring the inclusion of transgender individuals in various aspects of society.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** NFHS-5 was conducted during 2019-2021, not just 2019-2020. While the precise increase in spousal violence needs to be checked against prior surveys, NFHS-5 did reveal concerning figures on spousal abuse.  Importantly, NFHS-5 data does indicate that the total fertility rate in India is approaching or is below the replacement level fertility, signaling a demographic shift. Understanding the trends revealed in NFHS-5 is crucial for policymaking related to women's health and well-being.


**7. With reference to the  Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The policy primarily focuses on providing free sanitary napkins to all menstruating women.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, is not solely focused on providing free sanitary napkins; its scope is broader, encompassing awareness, education, and access to hygiene products.  The policy explicitly recognizes menstruation as a natural process and aims to eliminate stigma. However, the policy does *not* mandate paid menstrual leave; this is a separate issue being debated in various countries.  Understanding the scope and limitations of the policy is critical for evaluating its potential impact.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The GHI is not released by the World Bank; it's published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe.  While India's GHI score improved slightly in 2023 compared to 2015, the improvement was not significant.  The GHI report does indeed focus on the indicators mentioned: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.  Understanding the methodology and limitations of the GHI is important for interpreting its findings accurately.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Credit Framework (NCrF) explicitly aims to create a seamless system for credit transfer across different educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational training). This improves flexibility and allows students to move between these levels more easily.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCrF does utilize the concept of "Notional Learning Hours," the total number of notional learning hours per year is defined as 1200, not 1000 hours, across school, college, vocational, and skill education.  The discrepancy between the stated and actual number is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF divides education into eight levels, not nine. Levels 1-4 represent school education, and levels 4.5-8 encompass higher education and vocational training. The introduction of a ninth level is a fabricated detail to mislead the examinee. The slight alteration in the number of levels acts as a significant distractor, requiring precise recall of the NCrF details.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations for HEI accreditation included a transition to a binary system (Accredited/Not Accredited), moving away from the previous multi-point grading scale used by NAAC. This is a significant reform in the accreditation process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NAC, as per NEP 2020, is a component of the Higher Education Commission of India (HECI), not under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. The statement deliberately misplaces the organizational affiliation of the NAC to confuse the candidate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UGC does grant recognition to HEIs under the UGC Act of 1956, the statement incorrectly asserts that accreditation is handled solely by the NAAC.  Multiple agencies at both the Union and State levels are involved in the assessment, accreditation, and ranking of HEIs. The exclusivity assigned to NAAC is a false assertion designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the multifaceted nature of HEI evaluation.



**3. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NMC Act, 2019, established the NMC as a statutory body under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, responsible for regulating medical education and practice.

3. The NMC is solely responsible for accrediting all medical colleges in India, without any involvement of other national or international bodies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NMC was indeed established under the NMC Act, 2019, and functions under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, overseeing medical education and practice in India. This is a foundational fact about the NMC's role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WFME recognition granted to the NMC ensures accreditation for the next 10 years, not 20, for existing and new medical colleges.  The alteration of the timeframe is a deliberate attempt to create confusion. The candidate needs to remember the exact duration of the WFME accreditation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NMC's role in accrediting medical colleges is not exclusive. While it plays a central role, other national and international bodies are involved in the overall process of quality assurance and recognition of medical institutions. The assertion of sole responsibility by the NMC is designed to test the examinee's understanding of the complexities of the medical accreditation landscape.  The statement presents a false sense of exclusivity.


**4. With reference to the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR) and Vidya Samiksha Kendras (VSKs), consider the following statements:**

1.  VSKs are data repositories under NDEAR, primarily focused on monitoring projects under the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. VSKs, as part of NDEAR, function as data repositories, primarily tracking the progress of projects under Samagra Shiksha. This is a core function of the VSKs within the broader NDEAR framework.

Statement 2 is correct. NDEAR is indeed a collaborative effort between the MoE and MeitY. However, it is designed to improve learning outcomes at all levels of education, not solely higher education. The limitation of the scope to higher education is a misleading detail.  The candidate must understand the overall objective of NDEAR.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the MoE has encouraged the establishment of VSKs, it hasn't mandated their presence in every district. The statement wrongly asserts a nationwide mandatory deployment of VSKs, testing the candidate's understanding of the actual implementation strategy.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system based on age groups.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE does propose a revised 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, shifting from the earlier age-based four-stage system. This is a major structural change recommended by the NCF-SE.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE recommends proficiency in at least three languages, not four, with at least two being Indian languages. The addition of a language creates a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall the precise number of languages recommended.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE explicitly advocates against a rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects at the secondary level, promoting flexibility and integrated learning. The statement presents the opposite of the actual recommendation, acting as a strong distractor.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AWWs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, supplemented by performance-based incentives. This is a key aspect of their compensation structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improving the nutritional status of children (0-6 years) is a core objective, the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme also extends its focus to adolescent girls (14-18 years) in certain regions and early childhood care and education (3-6 years).  The limited scope presented in the statement is a misleading detail.

Statement 3 is correct. Many Anganwadi centers are indeed equipped with smartphones and digital tracking systems (like the Poshan Tracker app) to enhance service delivery and monitoring. This reflects the increasing digitalization of the Anganwadi system.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP and FAO. This is a crucial detail that differentiates the organizations involved in the GHI report.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's GHI score in 2023 did indeed place it in the "Serious" category of the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. This is a factual detail from the GHI report.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI primarily utilizes indicators related to undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to assess hunger levels.  These are the core parameters used in calculating the GHI score.


**8. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.
2.  The rules explicitly allow commercial surrogacy for infertile couples who meet specific medical criteria.
3. The rules prohibit single women from availing surrogacy services under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amended rules allow surrogacy with donor gametes only if at least one gamete originates from the intending couple. This is a key restriction introduced by the amendment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rules strictly prohibit commercial surrogacy; only altruistic surrogacy is permitted. The allowance of commercial surrogacy is a false statement designed to test knowledge of the regulations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the rules place restrictions on single women undergoing surrogacy, they don't impose an outright ban.  Single women can use their own eggs and donor sperm. The complete prohibition presented is a misleading detail.


**9. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR defines manual scavenging to include cleaning of human waste from insanitary latrines without appropriate protective gear.
2. The PEMSR mandates that all local authorities must provide alternative employment and financial assistance to all identified manual scavengers.
3. The PEMSR makes it an offense to construct new insanitary latrines, but it does not address the issue of existing insanitary latrines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PEMSR's definition of manual scavenging explicitly includes the cleaning of human waste from insanitary latrines without adequate safety measures. This is a central aspect of the Act's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PEMSR mandates rehabilitation efforts, it doesn't guarantee alternative employment and financial assistance to *all* identified manual scavengers. The scope of the rehabilitation provisions is not absolute.  The statement presents an overly broad interpretation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PEMSR addresses both the construction of *new* insanitary latrines and the demolition or conversion of *existing* ones within a specified timeframe.  The statement incorrectly limits the Act's reach to only new constructions.


**10. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a "child" as a person below the age of 16 years.
2. The Act categorizes offenses committed by children into heinous offenses, serious offenses, and petty offenses.
3. The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to handle cases involving children in conflict with the law, but it does not provide for any appellate mechanism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a "child" as a person below the age of 18 years. The statement provides an incorrect age limit, acting as a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does categorize offenses committed by children into heinous, serious, and petty offenses. This categorization is a key element of the Act's framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act does establish Juvenile Justice Boards and also provides for an appellate mechanism. The denial of an appellate mechanism is a false statement intended to test the examinee's knowledge of the Act's provisions.


**1. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF mandates a rigid, linear progression through eight educational levels, with no flexibility for students to switch paths.
2.  Credits earned through vocational training are not integrated into the NCrF's credit system.
3. The NCrF aims to establish a total notional learning hour of 1200 hours per year across school, college, vocational, and skill education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCrF explicitly seeks to *integrate* credits earned through various educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational, and skill education), promoting flexibility and mobility between them.  The framework allows for multiple entry and exit points, enabling lifelong learning and a non-linear educational journey.  The eight levels are a framework, not a rigid structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A core feature of the NCrF is the integration of credits earned from vocational education and training into the overall credit system. These credits are stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC), allowing for seamless transfer between different educational and training programs.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCrF establishes a standardized total notional learning hour of 1200 hours per year across all educational and training pathways to ensure consistency and comparability of credit accumulation. This considers classroom attendance, tests, and assignments.


**2. With reference to the accreditation of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The K. Radhakrishnan Committee recommended a transition to a binary accreditation system (Accredited/Not Accredited), eliminating the existing graded system.  
2. The National Accreditation Council (NAC), envisioned in the NEP 2020, is proposed as a meta-accrediting body, responsible for overseeing all HEI accreditation agencies.  
3. The University Grants Commission (UGC) is the sole agency responsible for the accreditation and ranking of all HEIs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The K. Radhakrishnan Committee's recommendations for HEI accreditation include a shift from the existing graded system (e.g., the 8-point NAAC system) to a binary system of "Accredited" or "Not Accredited," with potential subdivisions within the "Not Accredited" category to indicate the degree of shortfall.

Statement 2 is correct. The NEP 2020 envisions the establishment of the NAC as a meta-accrediting body. This body would not directly accredit HEIs, but it would oversee and supervise the work of independent accrediting agencies, ensuring consistency and quality across the accreditation landscape.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UGC plays a significant role in recognizing HEIs under the UGC Act, 1956, it is not the sole agency responsible for accreditation and ranking. Multiple agencies at both the Union and State levels are involved in these processes, including the NAAC, and the future NAC.


**3. With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC) and its recent recognition by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME), consider the following statements:**

2. The NMC Act, 2019 established the NMC as the regulatory body overseeing medical education and practice in India.
3. The WFME recognition automatically accredits all existing and future medical colleges in India for the next 10 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the WFME granted the NMC recognition for 10 years, not 5.  The duration of the recognition is crucial for understanding its impact on the long-term quality assurance of medical education in India.

Statement 2 is correct. The NMC Act, 2019, established the NMC as India's regulatory body for medical education and practice, replacing the Medical Council of India (MCI). This is a key piece of information in understanding the context of the WFME recognition.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the WFME recognition benefits all existing (706) medical colleges and those established in the next 10 years, it doesn't automatically grant accreditation. The recognition applies to the NMC itself, which in turn facilitates the accreditation of medical colleges under its purview.  The recognition streamlines the process but doesn't replace the need for individual college accreditation.


**4. With reference to the National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, and the National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. Both Acts aim to improve the quality of education and increase access to affordable healthcare in their respective fields by establishing regulatory bodies similar to the NMC.
2. The NNMC Act repeals the Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, while the NDC Act repeals the Dentists Act, 1948.
3. The NNMC Act introduces a national exit test for nurses and midwives, similar to the National Exit Test for medical graduates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Both the NNMC Act and NDC Act follow the model of the NMC, aiming to improve the quality of education and increase access to affordable healthcare within their respective sectors. They establish regulatory bodies to standardize education and professional practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The NNMC Act explicitly repeals the outdated Indian Nursing Council Act, 1947, while the NDC Act repeals the Dentists Act, 1948. This signifies a major restructuring of the regulatory framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage mentions an exit test for dentists under the NDC Act, but it does not mention a similar exit test for nurses and midwives under the NNMC Act.  While the Acts aim for improved standards, they do not necessarily include identical mechanisms such as national exit tests.


**5. With reference to the Samagra Shiksha Kendras (VSKs) and the National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR), consider the following statements:**

1. VSKs are decentralized data repositories designed to monitor and track the performance of various educational projects and schemes at the state level,  improving the efficiency of the school ecosystem.
2. NDEAR is a collaborative initiative between the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) to improve the quality of learning outcomes in schools.
3. VSKs primarily use paper-based records to collect data on student enrollment, learning outcomes, and dropout rates.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text clearly indicates that VSKs are designed to utilize data and technology to bring a leap in learning outcomes, acting as a digital data repository which will have data from all schemes run by MoE.  Paper-based records are not the primary method of data collection.


**6. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 data is collected by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) every five years.
2.  NFHS-5 provides comprehensive data on various health indicators, including maternal and child health, nutrition, and family planning.
3. NFHS-5 data is collected only from urban areas in India, providing a focus on urban health challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While NFHS surveys are conducted periodically, it is not explicitly stated that it is every five years in the given text. The frequency is implied but not definitively stated. The MoHFW is involved in the process, but not solely responsible for data collection.

Statement 2 is correct. NFHS-5 surveys collect comprehensive data on many health indicators, covering maternal and child health, nutrition, family planning, and other relevant aspects.  This makes it a valuable resource for policymakers and researchers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NFHS surveys cover both rural and urban areas in India, providing a comprehensive picture of health indicators across the entire country.  The data is not limited to urban areas alone.

1.  The report is jointly prepared by UN Women and the World Bank, and it introduces a single index to measure women's empowerment and gender equality.
2. The 'Women's Empowerment Index (WEI)' focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities in life.
3. The 'Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI)' compares the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human development, highlighting gaps in parity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 'Path to Equal' report is jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP (United Nations Development Programme), not the World Bank.  Furthermore, the report introduces *two* indices—the WEI and the GGPI—not a single index.

Statement 2 is correct. The WEI, as described in the text, focuses exclusively on women, assessing their agency and opportunities.

Statement 3 is correct. The GGPI, as described, compares women's status to men's in key human development areas, revealing disparities between genders.

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2. The index uses four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
3. In 2023, India was ranked below the 100th position among the countries included in the index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP.  This is a crucial detail for understanding the source of the data and its methodology.

Statement 2 is correct.  The four parameters used in the Global Gender Gap Index are accurately listed in the statement.  These parameters provide a multi-dimensional assessment of gender equality.

Statement 3 is correct. India's 2023 ranking in the Global Gender Gap Index was 127 out of 146 countries, which is indeed below the 100th position.  This highlights India's relative position in terms of gender equality compared to other nations.


**9. With reference to the Gender Social Norms Index, consider the following statements:**

It's a comprehensive assessment encompassing various aspects of the school education system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A key highlight of the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22 explicitly states that *no* State/UT attained the highest grade ('Daksh').  This indicates a need for further improvements in the school education systems across the country.

Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D (District) report integrates data from both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years, providing a more comprehensive analysis of performance at the district level.

3. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) will digitally store academic credits earned only from Indian institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NEP 2020 does aim for a significant increase in GER, the target year is 2035, not 2025.  This ambitious goal requires substantial investment and reforms in the higher education sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 proposes both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate degree programs.  Crucially, it also introduces *multiple* exit options, allowing students to earn certificates, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees depending on their progress and career aspirations. This flexibility enhances accessibility and caters to diverse learning pathways.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Madhya Pradesh actually has one of the *highest*, not lowest, populations of STs in India.  This highlights the significant tribal population residing in the state and the need for focused welfare initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for formulating and implementing policies and programs related to tribal welfare.  This centralized approach aims to coordinate efforts and ensure effective resource allocation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a pre-agricultural level of technology is a factor, the identification of PVTGs considers multiple criteria, including low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNHCR report states that around 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced in 2022, a 21% increase compared to 2021, not a 20% increase.  The exact percentage increase is crucial for accuracy.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The report shows that 76%, not 75%, of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.  A small difference in percentage can significantly alter the interpretation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report states that 30%, not 40%, of forcibly displaced people are children. This is a significant difference and makes the statement inaccurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is largely correct, although with a minor numerical inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While AWWs do receive ₹4,500 per month as a central honorarium, the amount for AWHs is not a fixed national amount,  but rather determined by the government and can vary.  The statement oversimplifies the compensation structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Poshan Tracker application is a broader tool for monitoring various aspects of nutrition, including the nutritional status of children from 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers. It's not limited to just the 0-3 age group.  The statement wrongly restricts the application's scope.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a comprehensive initiative that addresses health at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels, not just tertiary care. The statement incorrectly limits its scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve UHC by providing accessible, affordable, and quality healthcare services for all citizens.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on improving immunization coverage among children aged 0-5 years and pregnant women, not on their nutritional status.  Nutritional aspects are addressed through other programs.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA 2005 defines domestic violence comprehensively, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, and economic abuse.  The statement erroneously restricts the definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PWDVA 2005 primarily provides for civil remedies, it doesn't preclude criminal prosecution.  Criminal charges can be filed separately under other relevant laws. The statement incorrectly suggests that criminal prosecution is excluded.

Statement 3 is correct.  Judicial interpretations have expanded the definition of "domestic relationship" to encompass same-sex couples, recognizing their vulnerability to domestic violence.


**8. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 prohibits the employment of children below the age of 18 in all occupations.
2. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to families of child labourers, without addressing their rehabilitation.
3.  The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) portal is a government initiative aimed at rescuing and rehabilitating child labourers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2016 amendment prohibits employment of children below 14 years in *all* occupations and employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  The statement incorrectly states a blanket prohibition for all children below 18.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCLP scheme focuses on both providing financial assistance and addressing the rehabilitation of child labourers through education and skill development.  The statement wrongly states that rehabilitation is not addressed.

3.  The Act mandates that all adoption orders must be issued by a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a child as a person below 18 years of age. The statement gives an incorrect age limit.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does include a provision for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in cases of heinous offences, subject to assessment by a Juvenile Justice Board.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The amendment to the Act in 2021 changed this, allowing District Magistrates to issue adoption orders.  The statement reflects an outdated procedure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for the welfare of STs, while the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment handles SC welfare. The statement incorrectly assigns responsibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The population of SCs is not uniformly distributed; their concentration varies significantly across different states and union territories. The statement is factually incorrect.

Statement 3 is correct.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs accurately include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a stagnant or declining population.  These indicators reflect their vulnerability.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE, released by the Ministry of Education, proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. The NCF-SE advocates for the integration of vocational education at the secondary stage, blurring the lines between academic and vocational streams.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This structure aims to provide a more holistic and flexible approach to school education.  The existing four-stage system is replaced to better cater to the developmental stages of children.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE promotes multilingualism and emphasizes the importance of Indian languages, it doesn't mandate proficiency in *at least three languages*, including a foreign language.  The framework encourages proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages. The focus is on preserving and promoting India's linguistic diversity.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE strongly advocates for integrating vocational education into the mainstream curriculum, particularly at the secondary level.  This integration aims to break down the traditional barriers between academic and vocational streams, providing students with a broader range of skills and opportunities. The framework envisions a more flexible and inclusive education system that caters to diverse interests and career aspirations.

3. The PGI-D report focuses solely on quantitative data related to infrastructure and resource allocation in schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PGI does indeed assess performance at state and district levels using UDISE+ and NAS data, the years mentioned are incorrect. PGI 2.0 used UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021 data.  The use of accurate data sources is crucial for the reliability and validity of the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect. No state/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in PGI 2.0, which is true. However, Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the grade 'Prachesta-2', not 'Utkarsh'.  The grading system in PGI 2.0 has specific categories, and it's important to accurately identify the grade achieved by different states/UTs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report considers a broader range of factors than just quantitative data on infrastructure and resource allocation. It also incorporates qualitative aspects of school performance, such as effective classroom transactions and school safety.  A holistic assessment requires analyzing both quantitative and qualitative indicators to provide a comprehensive evaluation.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, facilitating seamless transfer across these levels.
2. The NCrF establishes a system where credits earned through various forms of learning, including experiential learning, are recognized and stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A core objective of the NCrF is to create a unified credit framework that allows for the seamless transfer of credits earned across different levels of education—school, higher education, and vocational training. This increased flexibility benefits students who may switch educational paths or pursue further learning later in life.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF recognizes that learning occurs in various settings. It allows for the accumulation of credits through academic programs, vocational training, and experiential learning. These accumulated credits are digitally stored in the ABC, creating a comprehensive record of a learner's achievements regardless of the educational pathway.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCrF does not mandate a uniform, nationally prescribed curriculum for all vocational training programs.  It aims to recognize and integrate a diverse range of vocational skills and training programs.  A standardized curriculum would stifle innovation and limit the diversity of vocational opportunities.  The framework focuses on credit accumulation and transfer, not curriculum standardization.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, mandate that institutions seeking DtBU status must have been in existence for at least 20 years.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status are permitted to start new courses or programs without any external approval.
3.  The NCERT, after being granted DtBU status, can now offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, *removed* the 20-year existence requirement for institutions seeking DtBU status.  This change aims to streamline the process and allow newer institutions to achieve DtBU status based on merit.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While DtBUs have greater autonomy, they are not permitted to start new courses or programs *without any external approval*.  They require the approval of their Executive Council and, where applicable, relevant statutory councils.  This regulatory oversight ensures quality control and adherence to established standards.

Statement 3 is correct.  The granting of DtBU status to the NCERT has indeed empowered it to offer its own graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees. This increased autonomy allows the NCERT to play a more significant role in shaping higher education in India.  This reflects the broader shift towards greater autonomy within the higher education sector.


**5. With reference to the  National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 data indicated a significant increase in the total fertility rate (TFR) across all states of India compared to NFHS-4.
2. NFHS-5 findings revealed improvements in several key health indicators, including maternal mortality rate (MMR) and institutional deliveries.
3. NFHS-5 data collection involved a nationally representative sample of households across urban and rural areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NFHS-5 data showed a *decrease* in the total fertility rate (TFR) in India compared to NFHS-4. While the decrease wasn't uniform across all states, the overall trend reflected a decline in fertility rates.  This decline is a significant indicator of progress in family planning and reproductive health.

Statement 2 is correct. NFHS-5 did indeed indicate improvements in several crucial health indicators.  Reductions were observed in both the maternal mortality rate (MMR) and an increase in institutional deliveries.  These improvements reflect enhanced access to healthcare services and improved maternal health outcomes.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NFHS-5 data collection methodology employed a nationally representative sample of households, ensuring the data's generalizability to the entire Indian population.  The sample included both urban and rural areas, providing a comprehensive picture of health indicators across various geographic contexts.


**7. With reference to the Ayushman Bharat Yojana, consider the following statements:**

2. Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to cover all citizens of India, regardless of their socioeconomic status, under a single health insurance scheme.
3. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM) is a supplementary initiative to Ayushman Bharat Yojana, aimed at improving access to healthcare services through technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) adopts a holistic approach to healthcare, addressing primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of care. While ABY primarily focuses on providing financial protection for secondary and tertiary care through its health insurance scheme, it also promotes and supports primary healthcare initiatives.  A comprehensive healthcare system requires a multi-level approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ABY aims to provide comprehensive health insurance coverage to a significant portion of the Indian population, it doesn't cover *all* citizens.  It targets specific socioeconomic groups, primarily those below the poverty line and those lacking adequate health insurance. The scheme's coverage is substantial but not universal.

Statement 3 is correct. ABDM is indeed a supplementary initiative that leverages technology to improve access to and efficiency of healthcare services within the broader framework of ABY.  The integration of technology plays a vital role in creating a more efficient and interconnected healthcare system.  The ABDM is a crucial component in modernizing India's healthcare infrastructure.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Anganwadi workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government, with no provision for performance-based incentives.
2. The Anganwadi system is primarily focused on providing supplementary nutrition to children aged 0-6 years, neglecting other aspects of child development.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to upgrade and strengthen Anganwadi centers across India, incorporating digital technologies for improved service delivery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government. However, they are also eligible for performance-based incentives.  These incentives encourage better service delivery and improved outcomes. The performance-linked incentives are a crucial part of motivating and rewarding frontline workers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system's scope is far broader than just supplementary nutrition.  It plays a crucial role in providing early childhood care and development services, including health check-ups, immunizations, and pre-school education.  A holistic approach is vital in addressing the multifaceted needs of young children.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative is specifically designed to upgrade and strengthen Anganwadi centers across the country, including the integration of digital technologies.  This modernization aims to improve service delivery, enhance monitoring, and strengthen data management within the Anganwadi system.  The use of technology is a key component of this initiative.


**9. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, ranked India among the countries with the lowest levels of hunger globally.
2. The GHI uses four indicators—undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality—to assess the severity of hunger.
3. The Indian government has consistently endorsed the GHI methodology and its findings regarding India's hunger levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 ranked India relatively low, indicating a *serious* hunger situation, not among the lowest levels globally.  India's ranking highlights the ongoing challenges in addressing hunger and malnutrition within the country.  The ranking reflects the urgency to improve nutritional outcomes.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI's methodology utilizes four key indicators—undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality—to provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger levels.  These indicators capture different aspects of malnutrition and its impact on child health and development.  The multi-indicator approach provides a nuanced understanding of the hunger situation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian government has expressed reservations and disagreements with the GHI methodology, citing concerns about data sources and the overall approach.  The government's critique highlights the ongoing debate and differences in perspectives on assessing hunger levels.  The lack of consensus underscores the complexity of measuring hunger accurately.



**10. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act criminalizes the employment of individuals for manual scavenging, regardless of whether protective gear is used.
2. The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, regardless of their location or ownership.
3. The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PEMSR Act criminalizes the employment of individuals for manual scavenging, even if protective gear is used. The act aims to completely eradicate this hazardous practice.  The use of protective gear does not legitimize the inherently dangerous nature of manual scavenging.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PEMSR Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their demolition within a specified timeframe regardless of location or ownership. The process is more nuanced, involving surveys, planning, and phased implementation. The phasing reflects the practical challenges involved in eliminating insanitary latrines.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PEMSR Act includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  This includes providing alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and other support mechanisms to help them transition to safer and more dignified livelihoods.  Rehabilitation is a crucial aspect of the Act's overall goal of eliminating manual scavenging.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy rates, and economic backwardness.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is recognized in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. Odisha does indeed house the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India. The criteria for identifying PVTGs encompass pre-agricultural technology levels, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Finally, the Bharia tribe is explicitly mentioned as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correctness of all three statements. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one true statement.


**2. With reference to the measures undertaken for Tribal Welfare, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
2.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to prepare a nationwide list of castes belonging to Denotified Tribes (DNTs).
3.  The "Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED)" focuses solely on providing free competitive exam coaching to DNT students.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  Statement 2 is also correct; the NCDNT's mandate includes creating a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While the SEED scheme does offer free competitive exam coaching, it also encompasses other initiatives like providing health insurance to DNT families.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement or omit a true one.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, including police forces.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and victims of acid attacks.
3.  The Act establishes a special court in every district for the faster adjudication of cases under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The RPwD Act does recognize 21 types of disabilities, as stated, and it also aims to establish special courts in each district for quicker case resolution. However, Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Act does mandate reservations for PwDs in higher education and government jobs, it explicitly excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs police) from this reservation policy.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully correct, leading to option (a) as the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the partially false statement 1.


**4. Consider the following statements about Manual Scavenging in India:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a year of the Act coming into force.
2.  Under the PEMSR Act, employing individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without appropriate protective gear is a punishable offense.
3. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) solely focuses on providing financial assistance to identified manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The PEMSR Act does indeed criminalize employing individuals for sewer and septic tank cleaning without proper safety equipment. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act does not mandate the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe but rather aims for their gradual conversion or demolition. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the SRMS scheme aids in rehabilitation through vocational training and other support mechanisms beyond just financial aid. Therefore, option (b) is the correct choice as it identifies the single completely true statement. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one false statement.


**5. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education System, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for the year 2021-22 classified States/UTs into ten grades, with "Daksh" being the highest and "Akanshi-3" being the lowest.

3. The PGI-D report focuses solely on the assessment of infrastructure and resource availability in schools.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The PGI 2.0 report did indeed classify States/UTs into ten grades, as described. Statement 2 is false; no State/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0; Punjab and Chandigarh reached "Prachesta-2".  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the PGI-D report assesses various aspects of school education, including outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety, not just infrastructure. Therefore, option (a) is correct because it pinpoints the single true statement. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one false statement.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for Higher Education, consider the following statements:**

2. The NEP mandates a 4-year undergraduate degree program with only one exit option at the end of the fourth year.
3. The NEP proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are accurate. The NEP does aim for a 50% GER by 2035 and proposes the creation of MERUs.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The NEP advocates for 3 or 4-year undergraduate programs *with multiple exit options* after each year of study (certificate, diploma, bachelor's, and honors degree). Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely correct, leading to option (a) as the right answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the false statement or omit true ones.


**7. Consider the following statements about Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs) in India:**

(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The 2023 regulations did lower the age requirement for DtbU applications, and the NCERT did receive DtbU status, granting it the authority to offer its own degrees.  However, statement 2 is false. While DtbUs have significant autonomy, they still require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils before introducing new courses or programs.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are fully true, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one false statement.


**8. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. FHEIs in India do require prior Central Government approval for foreign donations. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while top 500 ranking is a criterion, outstanding expertise in a specific area is also considered. Statement 2 is also false; the regulations explicitly prohibit online or distance learning programs for FHEIs in India.  Therefore, only statement 3 is completely accurate, making option (c) the right answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one false statement.


**9. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, but excludes experiential learning credits.
2. The NCrF divides education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 representing school education and levels 4.5-8 representing higher education.
3.  The NCrF utilizes the concept of "notional learning hours" to standardize the credit allocation across different educational pathways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The NCrF does use an eight-level framework as described, and it employs the concept of notional learning hours for credit standardization. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly *includes* credits earned through experiential learning. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely true, making option (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one false statement.


**10. With reference to the  Global Gender Gap Index and related indices, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. The description of the Gender Social Norms Index and its dimensions is accurate. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the description of the Global Gender Gap Index is accurate, India's ranking fluctuates and is often below 100.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the UHC SCI includes a broader range of health indicators beyond just maternal and child health.  Therefore, only statement 2 is completely true, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one false statement.

**1. Consider the following statements about the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:**

1.  The rules allow surrogacy using donor gametes only if the intending couple has a medical condition necessitating it, and the child has at least one gamete from the couple.
2.  Single women (widows or divorcees) can use donor sperm and their own eggs for surrogacy.
3.  The rules explicitly permit commercial surrogacy under specific circumstances,  provided the surrogate mother receives adequate compensation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, relaxed the earlier prohibition on donor gametes, allowing their use only when a medical condition necessitates it, and ensuring at least one gamete is from the intending couple.  This modification aims to balance ethical concerns with the needs of infertile couples.

Statement 2 is also correct. The amendment specifically addresses the situation of single women (widows or divorcees), allowing them to utilize their own eggs and donor sperm for surrogacy.  This provision reflects an expansion of access to assisted reproductive technologies for a broader range of individuals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments strictly prohibit commercial surrogacy.  The focus remains on altruistic surrogacy, where the surrogate mother receives only medical expenses and insurance coverage, not financial compensation beyond these essential costs.  Commercial surrogacy is considered unethical and exploitative.


**2. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Act allows for the filing of complaints only by the aggrieved woman herself, excluding any other person acting on her behalf.
3.  Reliefs provided under the PWDVA are exclusive and cannot be sought in conjunction with other legal proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PWDVA, 2005, offers a comprehensive definition of domestic violence, encompassing not only physical and sexual abuse but also emotional, verbal, economic, and other forms of abuse that inflict harm on the aggrieved woman.  This broad definition is crucial for addressing the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows for the filing of complaints not only by the aggrieved woman but also by a Protection Officer or any other person on her behalf, particularly in situations where the woman may be unable to act independently due to fear, intimidation, or other constraints. This provision ensures access to justice even in challenging circumstances.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, explicitly states that its provisions are in addition to existing laws.  This means that an aggrieved woman can seek remedies under the PWDVA concurrently with other legal proceedings, such as divorce, maintenance, or cases under Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code.  This allows for a more holistic approach to addressing the various legal and social implications of domestic violence.


**3. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, and its amendment in 2021, consider the following statements:**

3.  The 2021 amendment introduced provisions for appeals against adoption orders issued by Child Welfare Committees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2015 Act defined a "child" as a person below 18 years of age.  The 2021 amendment retained this definition but introduced a provision allowing for the trial of 16-18-year-olds as adults in cases of heinous offences, based on an assessment by the Juvenile Justice Board.  The core definition of a "child" remained unchanged at 18 years.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2015 Act categorized offences into heinous, serious, and petty offences.  While Juvenile Justice Boards handled all cases, the 2021 amendment further clarified the process and jurisdictional aspects of trying juveniles for different categories of offences.  The amendment did not change the basic principle of Juvenile Justice Boards handling juvenile cases.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2021 amendment significantly altered the adoption process by enabling District Magistrates to issue adoption orders and providing a mechanism for appeals against such orders before the Divisional Commissioner within 30 days.  This amendment streamlined the adoption process and introduced an appeals mechanism previously lacking.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1.  The NCrF is designed to solely integrate credits earned through higher education, excluding school and vocational education.
2.  The framework is based on a single, unified structure, encompassing the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).
3.  The NCrF primarily aims to restrict the transferability of credits between different educational and skill development pathways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A core objective of the NCrF is to establish a unified system that seamlessly integrates credits earned across various learning pathways, including school education, higher education, and vocational and skill development programs.  The framework aims to create flexibility and mobility for learners.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF is explicitly designed as an inclusive, single meta-framework that integrates the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF. This unified structure is intended to streamline the accumulation and transfer of credits earned through different educational and training programs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCrF's primary goal is to enhance flexibility and mobility for learners by facilitating the transferability of credits between various education and skill development pathways.  This is in line with the broader aim of creating a more integrated and flexible education system.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023 shows significant improvement in global hunger levels since 2015, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger worldwide.
2.  India's GHI score in 2023 showed a significant decline compared to 2015, placing it in a lower category of hunger severity.
3.  The GHI methodology has faced criticism regarding data sources, sample size, and methodological issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 report actually highlights minimal progress in reducing global hunger since 2015, emphasizing the combined negative impact of various crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and climate change.  The report underscores the persistent challenge of global hunger.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did show a slight improvement from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023,  this improvement is not significant enough to place it in a drastically lower category of hunger severity.  India remains categorized as having a "serious" level of hunger.

Statement 3 is correct.  The GHI methodology and its data have been subject to criticism, with concerns raised about data sources, sample size limitations, and potential methodological biases.  These criticisms highlight the need for ongoing evaluation and refinement of the GHI methodology to ensure accuracy and reliability.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium with no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi Services Scheme (now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The MoWCD is the nodal ministry responsible for the overall implementation and monitoring of the Anganwadi program.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium,  they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives based on their work and utilization of systems like the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under the POSHAN Abhiyan.  These incentives aim to encourage better performance and service delivery.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative has a broader scope than just child nutrition.  It aims to strengthen and upgrade AWCs to enhance overall efficiency and effectiveness, encompassing early childhood care and education (3-6 years), early stimulation (0-3 years), and even extending services to adolescent girls in specific regions.  The scope is much more holistic than just nutrition for young children.


**7. With reference to the  "Jobs at Your Doorstep" report by the World Bank, consider the following statements:**

1. The report focuses solely on urban employment scenarios in India.
2. The report suggests that India needs to adopt a coordinated approach towards skills development and employment to achieve its economic targets.
3. The report exclusively uses data from the formal sector to assess the employment landscape in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The World Bank's "Jobs at Your Doorstep" report does not limit its analysis to urban areas; it provides a comprehensive jobs diagnostic for young people across six diverse Indian states, including both rural and urban regions.  This comprehensive approach captures the nuances of employment across different geographical contexts.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key finding of the report is the critical need for a coordinated approach to skills development and employment in India to achieve ambitious economic goals.  The report emphasizes the importance of aligning skills development initiatives with actual job market demands.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report does not restrict its assessment to the formal sector; it encompasses a broader understanding of the employment landscape, including the informal sector, which is a significant component of India's economy.  Its analysis considers both formal and informal employment to provide a more realistic picture.


**8.  With reference to the  UNHCR's "Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022" report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicated a decrease in forced displacement globally compared to 2021.
2.  Low- and middle-income countries host the majority of the world's refugees.
3. The report primarily focuses on displacement due to climate change, neglecting conflicts and persecution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNHCR report showed a significant increase in forced displacement globally in 2022 compared to 2021, highlighting the growing global refugee crisis.  The report underscores the urgency of addressing the root causes of displacement.

Statement 2 is correct. A key finding of the report is that low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden in hosting the world's refugees, demonstrating the global inequity in refugee distribution and the strain on resources in developing nations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report covers a wide range of displacement causes, including conflicts, persecution, violence, and human rights violations in addition to climate-related displacement.  It presents a comprehensive picture of forced migration, recognizing the multiple factors contributing to the global refugee crisis.



**1. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), consider the following statements:**

1. IFPRI, established in 1975, is a primary research center under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2.  The IFPRI's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland, and it operates in over 60 countries, including India.
3.  A key finding of an IFPRI report indicated that food insecurity increased between 2020 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical instability, with projections suggesting a 72 million increase in undernourished individuals by 2050.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. IFPRI is indeed a major research center under CGIAR, established in 1975.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While IFPRI does operate in over 60 countries, including India, its headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva, Switzerland.  Statement 3 accurately reflects a key finding from an IFPRI report highlighting the rise in food insecurity due to various crises and projecting a substantial increase in undernourishment by 2050.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The incorrect location of the headquarters in statement 2 acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual details.


**2. With reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNHCR, established in 1951, is headquartered in New York City, USA, and works with over 100 countries, including India.
2.  The UNHCR's 2022 report, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement," revealed that approximately 100 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide due to conflict, persecution, and human rights violations.
3. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the primary legal frameworks guiding the UNHCR's operations, emphasizing the protection of refugee rights and international cooperation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1951, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the UNHCR's 2022 report did highlight a significant number of forcibly displaced people, the figure was actually around 108.4 million, not 100 million.  Statement 3 is correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed foundational to the UNHCR's mandate and operational framework.  Only statement 3 is entirely accurate, making (c) the correct answer.  The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2, particularly the altered figures and location, serve as strong distractors, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI, founded in 1993, is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and comprises over 150 national human rights institutions, including India's National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
2.  GANHRI's primary function is to review and accredit national human rights institutions based on the "Paris Principles," adopted in 1994, ensuring their compliance with international standards.
3.  GANHRI's accreditation process involves assessing factors such as political interference, investigative independence, and cooperation with civil society organizations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington, D.C., and it has around 120 member institutions, not over 150. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The Paris Principles were adopted in 1993, not 1994.  Statement 3 is correct. GANHRI's accreditation process does indeed evaluate these crucial aspects of national human rights institutions' performance.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 contain substantially correct information, though with minor inaccuracies. The incorrect details in statement 1, particularly regarding the headquarters and the number of member institutions, serve as effective distractors.


**4. With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNPFII, established in 2001, is a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
2. The UNPFII comprises 16 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations, serving three-year terms.
3. The UNPFII's mandate includes addressing indigenous issues related to economic development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII was established in 2000, not 2001, and it's a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly. Its headquarters are in New York. Statement 2 is correct. The composition and term length of the UNPFII's expert members are accurately described. Statement 3 is also correct. The UNPFII's mandate encompasses the broad range of indigenous issues listed.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. The inaccurate details in statement 1, particularly concerning the establishment year, parent body, and location, make it a strong distractor.


**5. With reference to the caste census in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Census of India, a Union subject under Article 246 of the Constitution, includes comprehensive caste-based data collection every decade, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 collected caste data, but only the data excluding caste was finalized and published in 2016.
3. The Bihar state government's recent caste survey was a full-scale census conducted under the Census Act of 1948.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Census of India is a Union subject,  the full caste enumeration has been abandoned after independence, with the exception of SCs and STs.  Statement 2 is correct. The SECC 2011 did collect caste data, but only other data was published. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bihar caste survey was not a full-scale census conducted under the Census Act of 1948; it was described as a social survey focused on caste demographics.  Only statement 2 is accurate, highlighting the selective publication of SECC data. The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3, particularly concerning the scope of the census and the legal basis of the Bihar survey, create effective distractors.


**6. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF, developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), includes 248 indicators aligned with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
2. The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific requirements in addition to those aligned with global SDG indicators.
3. India, through the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), has been a member of the IAEG-SDGs continuously since 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NIF was developed by the MoSPI, not the IAEG-SDGs, and it has 284 indicators, not 248,  although it aligns with the GIF. Statement 2 is correct. The NIF does include India-specific indicators. Statement 3 is partially correct. India has been a member of the IAEG-SDGs for multiple terms, but not continuously since 2015.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 contain substantially accurate information.  The incorrect attribution of NIF development and the precise number of indicators in statement 1, and the continuous membership claim in statement 3, function as strong distractors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while NFHS-5 covered all states and union territories, the survey fieldwork was conducted between 2019 and 2021, not just 2019-2020. Statement 2 is correct.  NFHS-5 did show a decline in TFR. Statement 3 is also correct.  NFHS-5 collected extensive data on various health indicators.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate. The slight inaccuracy regarding the timeframe in statement 1 functions as a subtle distractor.

3. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative aims to improve the infrastructure and digital capabilities of Anganwadi centers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Anganwadi centers are under the Ministry of Women and Child Development and offer a broader range of services beyond supplementary nutrition, including early childhood care and education. Statement 2 is correct. AWWs and AWHs receive a monthly honorarium and social security benefits. Statement 3 is also correct. Saksham Anganwadi focuses on upgrading infrastructure and digitalization. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The inaccurate ministry and limited scope description in statement 1 serves as a strong distractor.


**10. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI is released annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) and ranks countries based on four indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
2.  India's GHI score has consistently improved over the past decade, reflecting significant progress in reducing hunger.
3.  The methodology and data sources used in the GHI have been subject to criticism and debate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While there have been some improvements, India's GHI score hasn't shown consistent improvement over the past decade. Statement 3 is correct. The GHI's methodology and data have faced criticism.  Only statement 3 is accurate. The incorrect source and overly optimistic assessment in statements 1 and 2 function as substantial distractors.




**1. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme.
2.  India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was below 100.
3. The index assesses gender parity across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Index is indeed a significant metric for evaluating gender equality globally, but it's crucial to understand the nuances of its release and composition. Statement 1 is incorrect because the index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  The UNDP, however, releases the Gender Social Norms Index, a separate but related measure. Statement 2 is correct; India's rank in 2023 was 127 out of 146 countries, which is below 100.  Statement 3 accurately describes the four parameters used in the Global Gender Gap Index assessment. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international indices and their releasing bodies, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC preparation.


**2. With reference to the Gender Social Norms Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gender Social Norms Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum and measures gender parity across four parameters.
2. The index assesses the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide across dimensions including political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
3. India achieved a score of 44.4% representation of women in local governance in the 2023 Gender Social Norms Index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. The Gender Social Norms Index is not released by the World Economic Forum; it is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).  Moreover, it doesn't measure gender parity in the same way as the Global Gender Gap Index; its focus is different. Statement 2 correctly describes the purpose and dimensions of the Gender Social Norms Index.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the 44.4% figure for women's representation in local governance is not directly from the Gender Social Norms Index.  This data point comes from a different source and isn't a component of the GSNI itself. The question highlights the need to distinguish between different indices focusing on similar themes but with distinct methodologies and data sources.


**3. With reference to the Universal Health Coverage Service Coverage Index (UHC SCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The UHC SCI is released by UNICEF and the World Health Organization (WHO) and tracks SDG 3.8.1.

3. India's UHC SCI score improved from 63 in 2019 to 64 in 2021.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the UHC SCI is a joint release by the WHO and the World Bank, not UNICEF and WHO. Statement 2 accurately reflects the four indicator categories included in the UHC SCI. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's score actually declined from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021, showing a worsening of Universal Health Coverage indicators. The question tests the candidate's understanding of global health indices, their methodologies, and the specific data related to India's performance.  It also emphasizes the need for precise numerical data recall.

3. The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) evaluates the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2, 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Path to Equal Report, a joint effort of UN Women and UNDP (not the World Bank), introduces *two* indices, not one, to measure women's empowerment and gender equality. Statement 2 accurately describes the focus and scope of the Women's Empowerment Index (WEI). Statement 3 correctly explains the Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) and its approach to evaluating gender gaps.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific reports and their indices, emphasizing the importance of understanding their distinct methodologies and objectives.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the CSTT is currently working on technical and scientific terminology in 10, not 20, Indian languages.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the CSTT was established in 1961 under Article 344(4), not Article 344(3), of the Constitution of India. Statement 3 accurately states the objective of the CSTT. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of this specialized commission, its mandate, and the constitutional provisions related to its establishment.  It emphasizes the importance of precise factual recall, particularly regarding articles and numbers.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs actually include pre-agricultural levels of technology, *low* levels of literacy, and economic backwardness.  The statement inverts the reality of the economic and literacy status of PVTGs.  A high level of literacy and significant economic advancement would directly contradict the very definition of a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group.

Statement 2 is partially correct. Odisha does house the highest number (13) of PVTGs, but the wording "exceeding all other states" is overly definitive and could be considered a distractor.  The question aims to test precise knowledge, and while Odisha has the highest number, other states might have a comparable number in the future.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the reverse: All DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The statement incorrectly reverses this established relationship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.  The continued existence of the 1871 act is factually inaccurate.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Renke Commission (2008) indeed provided the estimate of nearly 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

3.  The responsibility for identifying manual scavengers rests solely with the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act does allow for the cleaning of human waste if appropriate protective gear and equipment are used, making it a crucial exception to the overall prohibition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act *does* make it an offense to construct insanitary latrines and also mandates the demolition or conversion of existing insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe. The statement omits this crucial aspect of the Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The responsibility for identifying manual scavengers rests with *local authorities* (municipalities, panchayats, cantonment boards, and railway authorities), not solely with the central government.  The statement misrepresents the decentralized nature of this responsibility.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act prescribes a punishment of imprisonment up to 2 years, or a fine up to Rs. One Lakh, or both, not 5 years and Rs. Two Lakhs.  The discrepancy in the penalty highlights the importance of precise knowledge of the legal provisions.   Incorrect information about penalties can lead to misinterpretations of the law's effectiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste, but safal karamcharis (sweepers or cleaning workers in municipalities, government, or private organizations) are *included* in the definition of manual scavengers, not excluded. This distinction is critical for understanding the scope of the Act's coverage. The inclusion/exclusion of specific groups directly impacts the number of people protected under the law.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act mandates the building and maintenance of community sanitary latrines by local authorities and makes the construction of insanitary latrines and the employment of manual scavengers offenses.

1.  The Act defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse, excluding emotional and economic abuse.
2.  The Act allows for the filing of complaints only by the aggrieved woman herself and not by any other person on her behalf.
3.  Reliefs provided under the PWDVA are exclusive and cannot be sought concurrently with other legal proceedings like divorce or maintenance petitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) Neither 1 nor 2 nor 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA, 2005, has a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, verbal, and economic abuse.  This comprehensive approach aims to address the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and provide comprehensive protection to victims.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act allows for the filing of complaints by the aggrieved woman, a Protection Officer, or any other person on behalf of the aggrieved woman. This provision acknowledges that victims may be incapacitated or unable to file a complaint themselves and ensures access to justice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act explicitly states that the remedies it provides are in addition to those available under other laws.  This means that an aggrieved woman can simultaneously seek relief under the PWDVA and pursue other legal avenues such as divorce, maintenance, or criminal proceedings under other relevant statutes.  This allows for a multi-pronged approach to addressing the various consequences of domestic violence.


**3. With reference to child labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below the age of 18 in all forms of employment.
2. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme is a state-level initiative aimed at rehabilitating child labourers.
3. The PENCiL (Platform for Effective Enforcement for No Child Labour) portal is managed by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  It does not prohibit the employment of all children below 18 in all forms of employment.  The law recognizes the developmental needs of adolescents and allows for certain exceptions under specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCLP scheme is a *central sector* scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not a state-level initiative. It aims at rehabilitating child labourers through the establishment of special schools and rehabilitation centers.  The central government plays a crucial role in coordinating and funding this nationwide effort.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. This ministry plays a significant role in child welfare, but the PENCiL portal specifically focuses on enforcement against child labour and the rescue and rehabilitation of victims.


**4.  Consider the following statements concerning the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 16 years of age.
2. The Act mandates that all offences committed by juveniles, regardless of severity, must be tried in a Juvenile Justice Board.
3. The 2021 amendment to the Act introduced provisions for appeals against adoption orders passed by Child Welfare Committees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JJ Act, 2015, defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.  While the Act allows for certain exceptions for heinous offences committed by those aged 16-18, the general definition remains 18 years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act provides for different courts and processes depending on the severity of the offence.  Offences punishable with imprisonment of more than seven years are tried in Children's Courts, while other offences may be tried by Magistrates of the First Class.  The Juvenile Justice Board plays a crucial role in determining the appropriate course of action but doesn't handle all cases.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the JJ Act empowered District Magistrates to issue adoption orders, and it also introduced provisions for appeals against these orders to the Divisional Commissioner.  The original 2015 Act did not provide for such appeals against Child Welfare Committee orders regarding adoption.


**5. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government jobs, including police forces.
2. The Act recognizes 15 types of disabilities, excluding intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3. The Act ensures free education for all children with disabilities between the ages of 6 and 18, regardless of the severity of their disability.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs, this reservation does *not* extend to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UTs).  The exclusion is a specific provision of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, which include intellectual disability and acid attack victims.  The Act's comprehensive list aims to cover a wide range of disabilities and ensure inclusive policies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act provides for free education for children with *benchmark* disabilities (at least 40% disability) between the ages of 6 and 18.  The provision does not extend to all children with disabilities, regardless of the degree of impairment.  The focus on benchmark disabilities reflects a policy decision to prioritize those with more significant needs.


**6. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of five years imprisonment for employing someone as a manual scavenger.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers to include only those employed to remove human excreta from insanitary latrines.
3. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of two years imprisonment or a fine up to ₹1 lakh, or both, for employing someone as a manual scavenger. The penalty reflects the seriousness of the offence but is less severe than stated in the question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act defines manual scavengers to include those employed to handle human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, irrespective of the type of latrine (insanitary or sanitary).  The definition aims to encompass the various situations where manual scavenging might occur.  The exception is for those cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The SRMS scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  While rural areas are significantly impacted by manual scavenging, the central government's responsibility for rehabilitation is under this ministry.


**7. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure, replacing the existing 10+2 structure.

3. The NCF-SE completely abolishes board examinations for Grades 10 and 12.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups (3-8, 8-11, 11-14, 14-18), replacing the older 10+2 structure.  This change is a key aspect of the NEP 2020 and aims to create a more holistic and flexible learning pathway.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE encourages multilingualism, promoting proficiency in at least three languages, but *at least two* should be Indian languages.  The emphasis is on promoting Indian languages and fostering linguistic diversity, not necessarily including foreign languages.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE does not abolish board examinations for Grades 10 and 12; it proposes reforms like allowing students to take the exams twice in a year and retaining the best score. The intent is to reduce stress and improve learning outcomes, not eliminate the exams altogether.


**8. Consider the following statements about the National Credit Framework (NCrF):**

1. The NCrF aims to create a separate credit system for vocational education and training, independent of the higher education credit system.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF aims to *integrate* the credit systems of school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education into a single, unified framework.  The goal is to create seamless pathways between different forms of learning and enhance flexibility for learners.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF allows for the accumulation and transfer of credits earned through various modes of learning, including formal academic education, vocational training, skill development programs, and experiential learning.  This flexibility is designed to recognize diverse learning pathways and enhance the value of non-formal learning.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF defines a standard notional learning hour of 1200 hours per year for school, college, vocational and skill education.  This standardization aims to provide a common metric for comparing different learning pathways and facilitating credit transfer.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The term PVTGs was initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs), but this was based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961), not the Elwin Commission.  The Elwin Commission focused on tribal welfare in different aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The number of PVTGs is 75, not 70, spread across 18 states and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every organization with 10 or more employees, not 50.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The POSH Act allows for the ICC to extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond three months, recognizing that victims may need more time to come forward. Statement 3 is incorrect because the POSH Act's definition of sexual harassment is broad and includes subtle forms of coercion, not excluding them.  The Act aims to encompass a wide range of behaviors that create a hostile work environment.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The JJ Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because the categorization of offences is not solely based on the nature of the crime but also considers the age of the juvenile (16-18 years old can be tried as adults in heinous offences). Statement 3 is incorrect as well; only offences punishable with imprisonment of more than seven years are tried in Children's Courts.  Other offences are tried by a Magistrate of the First Class. The Act's provisions aim to balance the need for rehabilitation with the gravity of the crime.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the National Family Health Survey (NFHS):**

1. The NFHS is conducted every five years to assess the health and nutritional status of women and children in India.
2.  NFHS data consistently shows that spousal abuse is uniformly distributed across all states in India.

3.  Visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater, is a criterion for ODF Plus Model village status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While sustained ODF status is crucial, the provided text doesn't specify a five-year timeframe.  The definition focuses on the *sustained* nature of the ODF status, not a specific duration.  The emphasis is on ongoing maintenance, not a fixed period.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that ODF Plus villages implement *either* solid *or* liquid waste management systems. This means that a village can achieve ODF Plus status by implementing only one of these systems, not necessarily both.

Statement 3 is correct.  The definition of an ODF Plus *Model* village explicitly includes visual cleanliness criteria such as minimal litter, minimal stagnant wastewater, and no plastic waste dumps in public places. This goes beyond the basic ODF Plus status.


**2. With reference to ODF Plus Model villages, consider the following statements:**

1.  The presence of ODF Plus Information, Education, and Communication (IEC) messages is a requirement for ODF Plus Model village certification.
2.  ODF Plus Model village status requires the implementation of both solid and liquid waste management systems.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of an ODF Plus Model village explicitly states that the display of ODF Plus IEC messages is a requirement for achieving this higher level of sanitation and cleanliness.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly states that an ODF Plus Model village must have arrangements for *both* solid *and* liquid waste management. This is a key distinguishing feature compared to the standard ODF Plus village.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Achieving ODF Plus status is a prerequisite, but it doesn't automatically qualify a village for ODF Plus Model status.  Additional criteria, such as those related to waste management and visual cleanliness, must be met to attain the "Model" designation.  The Model village status represents a higher level of achievement.


**3. With reference to the characteristics of ODF Plus villages, consider the following statements:**

1.  The absence of visible faeces in the environment is a necessary condition for ODF status but not sufficient for ODF Plus status.
2.  ODF Plus village status necessitates the implementation of comprehensive solid waste management systems.
3.  The criteria for ODF Plus villages are more stringent than those for ODF villages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The absence of visible faeces is essential for both ODF and ODF Plus statuses. However, ODF Plus adds further requirements like waste management systems.  The absence of faeces is a basic requirement, not a defining characteristic of ODF Plus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ODF Plus villages require *either* solid *or* liquid waste management systems, not necessarily both, making this statement too strong. The text does not specify that comprehensive systems are required.

Statement 3 is correct. ODF Plus villages build upon the foundational ODF status by adding further criteria related to waste management.  Therefore, the requirements for ODF Plus are indeed more stringent.  The ODF Plus designation signals a higher level of sanitation and cleanliness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly distinguishes between ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model villages, indicating that additional criteria must be met to achieve the "Model" designation.  Not all ODF Plus villages will automatically qualify as Model villages.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of ODF status explicitly states that every household and public/community institution must utilize safe sanitation technologies for faecal disposal.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Visual cleanliness is not a criterion for basic ODF status; it is a key component of the more advanced ODF Plus *Model* village status.  The ODF Plus Model village standard adds visual cleanliness to the requirements.

3. The UNHCR's work is guided by the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol, which define who is considered a refugee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNHCR is a UN agency, it was established in 1950, not 1945.  Its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  The UN headquarters are in New York.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNHCR report actually shows that forced displacement in 2022 was 21% *higher* than in 2021, indicating an increase in global displacement.  This rise highlights the ongoing challenges related to conflict, persecution, and other displacement factors.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal frameworks for the UNHCR's operations. They provide the legal basis for defining who qualifies for refugee status and the related protections afforded to them.  The UNHCR's work is heavily influenced by these key international legal instruments.

2. The NHRC's accreditation is crucial for representing India at the UN Human Rights Council.
3.  The NHRC's mandate includes investigating human rights violations related to caste discrimination and religious freedom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that GANHRI has *deferred* the accreditation of the NHRC on multiple occasions, citing concerns such as political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society. This indicates a lack of consistent full accreditation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Accreditation by GANHRI is essential for the NHRC to participate effectively in international human rights forums, including the UN Human Rights Council.  Without this accreditation, the NHRC's ability to represent India's perspective on human rights issues at the international level is significantly hampered.

Statement 3 is partially correct but lacks precision. While the NHRC does investigate human rights violations, it's not explicitly limited to caste discrimination and religious freedom.  Its mandate encompasses a broader range of human rights concerns. The statement oversimplifies the NHRC’s wide-ranging jurisdiction.


**4. With reference to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) publishes an annual report on the progress of SDGs, indicating that progress on most targets is consistently strong.
2. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is a dynamic set of indicators, regularly updated to reflect evolving global priorities.  It currently includes less than 200 unique indicators.

(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE does propose a 5+3+3+4 structure for school education, which is a significant change from the older 10+2 system.  This restructuring aims to create a more holistic and flexible approach to learning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCF-SE explicitly aims to *reduce* the rigid separation between academic and vocational subjects. It promotes greater flexibility and choice for students, allowing for a more integrated approach to learning. The statement misrepresents the framework's approach to vocational education.

Statement 3 is correct.  Multilingualism is a key feature of the NCF-SE, promoting proficiency in at least three languages, with an emphasis on Indian languages.  This reflects a commitment to preserving linguistic diversity and promoting multilingual education.


**6. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of STs.
2.  Lakshadweep has the highest percentage of ST population in India, followed by Mizoram.
3.  The Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are identified based on criteria including pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, and a declining population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes is the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, not the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.  The latter focuses on other vulnerable sections of society.

Statement 2 is correct. Lakshadweep indeed has the highest percentage of ST population, followed by Mizoram.  This highlights the geographical distribution of ST populations in India.

Statement 3 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  These factors are used to identify those tribal groups requiring special attention and support.


**7. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a "child" as anyone below the age of 16 years.
2. Offenses punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more are tried in designated Children's Courts.
3. The Act focuses solely on punitive measures for juvenile offenders, with minimal emphasis on rehabilitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a "child" as anyone below the age of 18 years, not 16.  This is a crucial distinction in determining the legal framework applicable to juveniles.

Statement 2 is correct.  Serious offenses, those punishable by imprisonment of seven years or more, are indeed tried in Children's Courts under the Act. This ensures that juvenile offenders receive specialized legal treatment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act addresses the justice aspects, it also places significant emphasis on the rehabilitation and care of juvenile offenders.  The focus is on restorative justice and providing opportunities for the child's reform and reintegration into society.  The statement misrepresents the Act’s balanced approach.


**8. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA), consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse inflicted by a husband on his wife.
2.  The Act provides for a comprehensive grievance redressal mechanism, including the possibility of seeking shelter and medical aid for the victim.
3. The PWDVA explicitly criminalizes marital rape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA has a much broader definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. It is not limited to physical abuse by a husband. The statement severely understates the scope of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish a grievance redressal mechanism and provides for various reliefs, including shelter and medical aid for victims of domestic violence.  This is a key feature aimed at protecting and assisting those affected.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PWDVA addresses domestic violence, it does not explicitly criminalize marital rape. Marital rape remains a complex legal issue in India, and the PWDVA focuses on civil remedies rather than criminal prosecution in this specific context.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 does indeed advocate for a revised 5+3+3+4 school structure, aligning with its foundational, preparatory, middle, and secondary stages.  However, the policy doesn't mandate the complete elimination of board examinations; instead, it suggests reforms and multiple examination opportunities.  The target GER for higher education set by NEP 2020 is 50% by 2035, not 100% by 2030. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi system is indeed a crucial component of the ICDS scheme, focusing on the nutritional and health status of children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  The renaming to Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 reflects a continued emphasis on these goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, the central government *does* provide additional performance-linked incentives, such as ₹500 per month for utilizing ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyan.  Many states/UTs also provide supplementary honorariums from their own resources.  The statement misrepresents the compensation structure by omitting these key additional components.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for AWWs, facilitating efficient service delivery and data recording. However, it goes beyond simple data recording; it's designed for *dynamic identification* of malnutrition prevalence among children and provides *last-mile tracking* of nutrition service delivery.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the National Health Policy 2017 does aim for UHC and affordable healthcare, it doesn't guarantee entirely *free* treatment for all.  The policy emphasizes affordability and quality across all levels of care, but it doesn't specify complete cost-free access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Ayushman Bharat Yojana takes a holistic approach, addressing health needs at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. The statement wrongly implies a singular focus on tertiary care.

Statement 3 is correct. The ABDM is accurately described in its aim to improve equitable access to healthcare services through technology and national portability.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GHI 2023 places India and South Asia at the same level, with a score of 28.7 for India. Sub-Saharan Africa also scores 27.0. The statement incorrectly positions India below these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did improve slightly from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023, this is a marginal improvement and doesn't indicate substantial progress. The statement overstates the level of improvement.

Statement 3 is correct. The Indian government's concerns regarding the GHI methodology, sample size, and data sources are well-documented.  These are the primary reasons cited for their objections.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NNM aims to reduce, not completely eradicate, malnutrition.  Complete eradication within a short timeframe (five years) is unrealistic and not a stated goal.

Statement 2 is correct. The NNM focuses on improving Anganwadi Services and reducing stunting in high-burden districts. This is a core objective of the mission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While stunting is a key indicator, the NNM considers a holistic approach to nutrition, encompassing pregnant women, mothers, and children, and considers multiple indicators beyond just stunting.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, falls under the MoWCD and is centrally sponsored.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the core objectives of the scheme: improving nutritional and health indicators for children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and reducing associated mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs do receive a performance-linked incentive, the amount is ₹500, not ₹1000, for utilizing the ICDS-CAS under POSHAN Abhiyaan.  The discrepancy in the incentive amount makes statement 3 factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. POSHAN Abhiyaan was launched in 2018 with the primary objective of reducing stunting in identified districts of India with the highest malnutrition burden.
2. The mission aims to ensure holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children up to the age of 18 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. POSHAN Abhiyaan was launched in 2017, not 2018. While the primary objective is to reduce stunting in high-burden districts, the launch year is crucial factual detail. Statement 2 is correct. The mission encompasses holistic development and adequate nutrition for pregnant women, mothers, and children, although the age limit is not explicitly 18 years; it primarily focuses on children under 6 years and their mothers.  Statement 3 is also correct; the POSHAN Tracker app is indeed utilized for the dynamic identification of malnutrition indicators among children and the monitoring of service delivery.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana aims to address health issues at the primary, secondary, and tertiary levels through holistic interventions, directly contributing to UHC.
2. The National Health Policy 2017 aims to achieve UHC by delivering quality healthcare services to all at an affordable cost.
3. The Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses solely on providing healthcare services to children and pregnant women with no direct connection to achieving UHC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana (ABY) is a major initiative designed to improve healthcare access and quality across various levels, directly contributing to the broader goal of UHC. Statement 2 is also correct. The National Health Policy 2017 explicitly aims to achieve UHC by providing affordable and quality healthcare services to all citizens. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Intensified Mission Indradhanush focuses on vaccinating children and pregnant women, it is a key component of achieving broader health goals, indirectly contributing to UHC by reducing child and maternal mortality and morbidity, thus improving overall population health.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are directly and explicitly related to the stated aims of UHC.


**4. With reference to the  'Triple Threat Report' released by UNICEF, consider the following statements:**

1. The report defines the "triple threat" as less than 50% access to at least basic water or sanitation services, the highest burden of deaths attributable to unsafe WASH among children under 5 within the top 20 countries globally, and being within the top 25% of countries facing the highest risk of climate and environmental hazards.
2. According to the report, inadequate WASH services in health facilities contribute to high neonatal mortality rates in India, which is currently around 34 deaths per 1000 live births.
3. The report highlights that the number of people defecating in the open in India has reduced significantly, by an estimated 550 million people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the UNICEF's "triple threat" definition, encompassing insufficient WASH access, high child mortality due to unsafe WASH within top-ranking countries, and elevated climate/environmental risk. Statement 2 correctly identifies the contribution of inadequate WASH services to high neonatal mortality in India; however, the neonatal mortality rate provided (34 deaths per 1000 live births) is slightly inflated; the actual rate is closer to 24. This minor factual inaccuracy does not invalidate the core statement about the correlation between WASH and neonatal mortality. Statement 3 is incorrect. The reduction in open defecation is significant, but the estimated figure is approximately 450 million, not 550 million.  The discrepancy in the number significantly alters the statement's accuracy.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are largely correct, despite the minor error in statement 2.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is ranked 101st among 125 countries, with a GHI score of 27.7, categorized as "Serious" on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale.
2.  South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa are the world regions with the highest hunger levels, with GHI scores of 28.0 each.
3. The GHI report indicates that since 2015, significant progress has been made in reducing hunger globally, reflecting the positive effects of various interventions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GHI 2023 ranks India at 111th out of 125 countries, with a score of 28.7, not 27.7.  The ranking and score are crucial factual details that render the statement inaccurate. Statement 2 is correct. South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa indeed register the highest hunger levels in the GHI 2023, although the precise scores might vary slightly depending on the source. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The GHI 2023 report highlights limited progress in hunger reduction since 2015, attributing this to various crises including the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine war, and climate change impacts.  The claim of significant progress contradicts the report's findings.  Consequently, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to the  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF Plus village is defined as one that has sustained its ODF status and has implemented either solid waste management or liquid waste management systems.
2.  As of September 2023, over 85% of Indian villages have achieved ODF Plus status under Phase-II of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).
3. An ODF Plus Model village, in addition to sustaining ODF status, must have arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, demonstrate visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, plastic waste), and display ODF Plus IEC messages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines an ODF Plus village.  The criteria include sustaining ODF status and implementing at least one of solid or liquid waste management systems. Statement 2 is incorrect. The reported percentage of Indian villages achieving ODF Plus status as of September 2023 is around 75%, not over 85%.  This numerical difference is a significant factual error. Statement 3 correctly outlines the criteria for an ODF Plus Model village, extending beyond the basic ODF Plus status to include both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC messaging. Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are accurate, while statement 2 contains a factual error.


**7. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and its Global Food Policy Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. IFPRI is a major research center established in 1976 under the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2. The 2023 report highlights a rise in food insecurity during 2020-2022 due to multiple crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and geopolitical instability.
3.  The report projects that climate change alone will lead to at least 82 million more people being undernourished by 2050.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IFPRI is indeed a major research center under CGIAR, its establishment year is 1975, not 1976.  This minor factual error affects the accuracy of the statement. Statement 2 accurately reflects a key finding of the IFPRI's 2023 report, noting the increase in food insecurity due to overlapping crises. Statement 3 is also largely correct, although the exact figure of additional undernourished people due to climate change by 2050 may vary slightly depending on the interpretation of the report's projections; the number projected is closer to 72 million.  The slight discrepancy in the projected number does not invalidate the core message about climate change's impact on food security. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are essentially correct, while statement 1 contains a minor factual error.


**8. With reference to the  UNHCR's 'Global Trends: Forced Displacement in 2022 Report', consider the following statements:**

1. The report indicates that approximately 108.4 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide in 2022 due to various factors, including conflict, persecution, and violence.
2. Forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022 was 20% higher than in 2021, according to the report.
3. The report states that over 80% of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the report's finding regarding the total number of forcibly displaced people in 2022. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report indicates that forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022 was 21%, not 20%, higher than in 2021. This small numerical difference is significant for factual accuracy. Statement 3 is correct. The report does show that a significant majority (76%, not over 80%) of the world's refugees are hosted by low- and middle-income countries.  The slight difference in the percentage does not invalidate the core finding. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and its accreditation by GANHRI, consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI, the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions, is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
2. GANHRI's deferral of NHRC accreditation in 2023 was primarily due to concerns about political interference in appointments and a lack of cooperation with civil society organizations.
3.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1994, serve as the basis for GANHRI's review and accreditation of National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GANHRI's headquarters are indeed located in Geneva, Switzerland. Statement 2 accurately reflects the reasons behind GANHRI's deferral of NHRC accreditation, citing concerns about political interference and insufficient cooperation with civil society. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Paris Principles were adopted in 1993, not 1994, and form the basis for GANHRI's assessment of NHRIs. This minor error concerning the adoption year impacts the statement's accuracy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**10. With reference to the  UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1.  UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), established in 2001.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII was established in 2000, not 2001, by a resolution of the ECOSOC. This minor inaccuracy affects the statement's validity. Statement 2 correctly describes the composition of UNPFII's membership, with an equal number of experts nominated by governments and indigenous organizations. Statement 3 accurately outlines the UNPFII's mandate, encompassing a wide range of indigenous issues. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct, while statement 1 contains a factual error.


**11. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of ST communities in India.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India.
3. The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs serves as the nodal ministry for ST welfare in India. Statement 2 is also correct. Odisha indeed houses the largest number of PVTGs among Indian states. Statement 3 accurately lists the criteria used to identify PVTGs, highlighting their pre-agricultural practices, low literacy, economic backwardness, and demographic characteristics.  Therefore, all three statements are factually accurate.


**12. With reference to the De-notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes (NTs) are DNTs, but not all DNTs are NTs.
2. The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
3. The SEED scheme, launched by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, provides free competitive exam coaching and health insurance to DNT families, amongst other benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between NTs and DNTs is not that all NTs are DNTs, but rather that all DNTs are NTs—a crucial distinction.  Statement 2 is correct. The NCDNT was indeed set up to create a comprehensive state-wise list of DNT castes. Statement 3 is also correct. The SEED scheme does offer the mentioned benefits to DNT communities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**13. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least a 6% reservation for persons with disabilities (PwDs) in government jobs.
2.  The act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The act provides for free education for children with benchmark disabilities between the ages of 5 and 17 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates a 4%, not 6%, reservation for PwDs in government jobs. This numerical inaccuracy makes the statement factually incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. The act does recognize 21 categories of disabilities, encompassing those mentioned. Statement 3 is largely correct, although the age range is slightly off; it's 6 to 18 years, not 5 to 17. The minor age discrepancy does not negate the core provision of free education for eligible children. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially correct.


**14. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle un-decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of their employment status (regular or contractual).
2. The act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines, employ individuals for cleaning sewers and septic tanks without protective gear, and fail to demolish or convert insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3. The act's rehabilitation provisions include training in alternate employment, financial assistance, and help with property acquisition, but it does not provide for any form of health insurance coverage for rehabilitated manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines manual scavengers under the PEMSR Act, encompassing various scenarios and employment types. Statement 2 correctly identifies several offenses under the act, including constructing insanitary latrines and unsafe cleaning practices. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PEMSR Act does include rehabilitation provisions such as training and financial aid, it doesn't explicitly exclude health insurance; the scope of rehabilitation assistance can include health-related support, depending on the specific implementation.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are explicitly and completely accurate based on the act's provisions.


**15. With reference to child labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  According to the 2011 Census, approximately 10.1 million children aged 5-14 were working in India, with Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh accounting for nearly 65% of the total.
2.  The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all forms of employment and prohibits adolescents (14-18 years) from working in hazardous occupations.
3. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme, a centrally sponsored scheme under the Ministry of Labour and Employment, primarily focuses on providing vocational training to rescued child labourers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the percentage of child laborers from the five mentioned states is slightly exaggerated; it's closer to 55%, not 65%.  This minor numerical inaccuracy doesn't invalidate the core claim about the distribution of child labor across these states. Statement 2 accurately reflects the key provisions of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act of 2016. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCLP Scheme focuses on rehabilitation and education, not primarily on vocational training, for rescued child laborers.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are largely accurate.


**16.  With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with a provision allowing children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in cases of heinous offenses, determined by a Juvenile Justice Board.
2.  The 2021 amendment to the act allows District Magistrates (DMs) to issue adoption orders, removing the requirement for civil court orders.
3. The act categorizes offenses committed by juveniles into heinous offenses (minimum punishment of seven years or more imprisonment), serious offenses (punishment of three to seven years imprisonment), and petty offenses (maximum punishment of up to three years imprisonment).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the definition of a child under the act and the provision for trying older juveniles as adults in specific cases.  Statement 2 is also correct. The 2021 amendment did delegate the authority to issue adoption orders to DMs. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the act does categorize offenses, the description of "serious offenses" is not entirely accurate; the amendment redefined "serious offenses" to include those with a maximum imprisonment of more than seven years, not necessarily three to seven years.  The inaccuracy in describing the "serious offenses" category makes the statement factually incorrect.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are fully correct.


**17. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every organization with 10 or more employees, irrespective of whether it is in the public or private sector.
2.  The act defines sexual harassment to include any unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, including physical contact, demands for sexual favors, sexually coloured remarks, and showing pornography.
3.  Under the POSH Act, a complaint of sexual harassment must be filed within six months of the incident, with no provision for extending this time limit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the POSH Act's mandate for establishing ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, applicable to both public and private sectors. Statement 2 correctly lists the various forms of conduct considered sexual harassment under the act.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the act does stipulate a three-month time limit for filing complaints, it allows for extensions under certain circumstances.  This inaccuracy renders the statement false.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**18. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 data indicates that approximately 30% of ever-married women aged 18-49 in India have experienced spousal violence (physical and/or sexual).
2.  According to NFHS-5, the percentage of spousal abuse was highest in Karnataka, followed by Bihar, Manipur, and Telangana.
3.  NFHS-5 data includes detailed information on child marriage prevalence, but it does not provide any data on the educational attainment of women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NFHS-5 data does indicate that approximately 29.3% (close to 30%) of ever-married women aged 18-49 have experienced spousal violence. Statement 2 is also correct.  NFHS-5 data reveals that Karnataka had the highest reported percentage of spousal abuse among the states listed. Statement 3 is incorrect. NFHS-5 does provide data on women's educational attainment, in addition to information on child marriage. The claim that it lacks data on women's education is false.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**19. With reference to the Medical Education and Regulation in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Medical Commission (NMC) is a statutory body established under the NMC Act, 2019, and is responsible for overseeing medical education and practice in India.
2. The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) recognition granted to the NMC ensures that all existing and new medical colleges in India will automatically receive WFME accreditation for the next 20 years.
3. The National Nursing and Midwifery Commission (NNMC) Act, 2023, and the National Dental Commission (NDC) Act, 2023, aim to improve the quality of education in the nursing, midwifery, and dental sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NMC is the regulatory body for medical education and practice, established under the 2019 act. Statement 2 is incorrect. The WFME recognition granted to the NMC is for 10 years, not 20 years, and while it impacts accreditation, it doesn't guarantee automatic accreditation for all colleges; there are still processes involved. Statement 3 is correct. The NNMC and NDC acts are designed to enhance the quality of education and regulation in the respective sectors.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are completely accurate.


**20. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 proposes a new curricular and pedagogical structure (5+3+3+4) for school education, replacing the existing four-stage structure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes NEP 2020's proposed restructuring of school education's curricular and pedagogical framework. Statement 2 is incorrect. NEP 2020's target GER for higher education by 2035 is 50%, not 60%. This numerical discrepancy makes the statement inaccurate. Statement 3 correctly mentions the establishment of the NRF as a key initiative under NEP 2020. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are factually accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the legal framework for child trafficking in India:**

1. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 primarily addresses the issue of child labour exploitation.
2. The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976 specifically prohibits the commercial dealing in human organs.
3. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 covers offences related to sexual assault, harassment, and pornography against children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, 1956, primarily focuses on combating immoral trafficking and sex work, including the exploitation of children in these contexts.  It doesn't directly address the broader spectrum of child labour exploitation covered by other acts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, aims to abolish the system of bonded labour, focusing on economic and physical exploitation.  The prohibition of commercial dealing in human organs falls under the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994.

Statement 3 is correct. The POCSO Act, 2012, specifically addresses sexual offences against children, encompassing sexual assault, sexual harassment, and pornography.  This act provides a dedicated legal framework for prosecuting such crimes and protecting child victims.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**2. With reference to the Age of Consent in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023 lowered the age of consent for sexual intercourse to 16 years for married women.
2. The POCSO Act, 2012 defines the age of a child as 18 years, establishing this as the default "age of consent."
3. The Supreme Court, in the Independent Thought vs. UoI case, upheld the exception for marital rape under the Indian Penal Code.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BNS, 2023, *raised* the age of consent for sexual intercourse to 18 years, even within marriage, eliminating the previous exception for married minors under 15.  It aimed to align the definition of rape with the POCSO Act's definition of a child.

Statement 2 is correct. The POCSO Act, 2012, sets the age of a child at 18, effectively establishing this as the legal age of consent for sexual activity. This act is crucial in protecting children from sexual abuse and exploitation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in the Independent Thought vs. UoI case, *read down* the exception for marital rape under the IPC, effectively removing the legal loophole that previously allowed sexual intercourse with a minor wife.  The court's decision strengthened the protection of women and girls.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Supreme Court judgment on LGBTQIA+ rights, consider the following statements:**

1. The court verdict explicitly recognized the fundamental right to same-sex marriage in India.
2. The court upheld the restriction imposed by CARA on adoption rights for non-heterosexual couples.
3. The court interpreted the Special Marriage Act (SMA) in a gender-neutral manner, extending its applicability to same-sex couples.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in Supriyo @ Supriya Chakraborty vs. Union of India, did *not* recognize a fundamental right to same-sex marriage. The court held that there was no explicit constitutional right to marriage, leaving the matter to legislative action.

Statement 2 is correct. The court upheld CARA's restriction on adoption rights for same-sex couples, citing potential negative consequences and emphasizing that such a significant change requires legislative action rather than judicial intervention.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The court *declined* to interpret the SMA in a gender-neutral way, stating that this would be an overreach of judicial power and could have unforeseen impacts on other related laws.  The court emphasized the need for legislative changes to address the issue of same-sex marriage and related rights. Thus, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Prayatna Project:**

1. The Prayatna Project is a livelihood and enterprise training program for transgender people in Delhi-NCR, approved by the PMKVY Executive Committee.
2. The nodal agency for the Prayatna Project is the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MoSJE), through its implementing agency, NSDC.
3. The Prayatna Project aims to provide skill development training only, excluding any focus on improving the basic quality of life for beneficiaries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

1. The Act mandates that every educational institution must provide inclusive education and opportunities for transgender persons, but only in government-funded institutions.
2. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in employment, education, housing, and healthcare, but excludes the private sector.
3. The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the Central Government on policies, programs, legislation, and projects related to transgender persons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's mandate for inclusive education and opportunities extends to *all* educational institutions, regardless of funding source (government or private).  The act seeks to ensure equal rights and opportunities for transgender individuals in all aspects of life.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act's prohibition of discrimination applies to both the public and private sectors, ensuring that transgender persons are protected from discrimination across all areas of life, including employment, education, housing, and healthcare.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act indeed establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to provide guidance and recommendations to the Central Government on various aspects related to transgender rights and welfare. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to the PM JANMAN (PM- Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PM JANMAN was announced in the Union Budget 2023-24, not 2022-23. The timing of the budget announcement is a crucial detail often tested in UPSC exams.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core objective of PM JANMAN is to ensure the availability of basic facilities and essential services to PVTG households, encompassing safe housing, clean drinking water, sanitation, education, and healthcare.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Ministry of Tribal Affairs plays a significant role, PM JANMAN involves 9 ministries in its implementation, reflecting a multi-sectoral approach to address the complex needs of PVTGs.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Panchsheel Principles explicitly stress the importance of respecting tribal rights, particularly their traditional claims over land and forest resources.  This principle is fundamental to ensuring tribal self-determination and sustainable development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The principles strongly oppose the imposition of alien values, advocating instead for allowing tribal communities to develop according to their own unique traditions and cultural practices.  Forced assimilation is counterproductive to genuine tribal development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The principles emphasize that the success of tribal development should not be solely judged by numerical data or statistics but rather by evaluating the overall improvement in the quality of life and human character within tribal communities. A holistic approach is crucial to assessing the effectiveness of tribal development programs.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the Panchsheel Principles.



**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is solely funded by the state governments, with no central government contribution.
2. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme aims to improve the nutritional and health status of children aged 0-6 years, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.
3. The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used to monitor nutrition service delivery and identify children with malnutrition, but not to track AWW performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme, now renamed Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0, is a *centrally sponsored scheme* under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), indicating joint funding by the central and state governments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary objective of the Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 scheme is to enhance the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  This is a core component of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) program.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Poshan Tracker app is utilized not only for monitoring nutrition service delivery and identifying malnourished children but also for tracking the performance of Anganwadi Workers (AWWs). This data-driven approach helps in improving program effectiveness and accountability.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**9. With reference to the National Nutrition Mission (NNM) or POSHAN Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. POSHAN Abhiyan primarily focuses on reducing stunting in all districts of India.
2. The NNM aims to improve utilization of key Anganwadi Services to achieve its objectives.
3. The NNM is solely implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on reducing stunting in identified districts with the *highest* malnutrition burden, not all districts of India.  The program targets areas where the need is most critical.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NNM aims to improve the utilization of Anganwadi services, which are crucial for achieving its nutritional goals.  By strengthening the Anganwadi system, POSHAN Abhiyan seeks to enhance its impact on the ground.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the MoWCD plays a major role, the NNM involves coordination and collaboration across multiple ministries to ensure a holistic approach to nutrition.  This multi-sectoral approach is vital for addressing the multifaceted nature of malnutrition.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**10. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023 shows a significant improvement in India's hunger levels compared to 2015, placing it among the countries with low hunger levels.
2.  The GHI 2023 report is published by the World Food Programme (WFP).
3.  The GHI 2023 uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to assess hunger levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 shows a *slight* improvement in India's score compared to 2015, but it still categorizes India as having "serious" hunger levels and ranks it relatively low among the assessed countries.  The improvement is marginal, not significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the WFP.  It's important to know the correct publishing organizations to avoid confusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to comprehensively assess hunger levels across nations. These indicators provide a multi-dimensional view of the problem.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**11. With reference to the Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented only solid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus Model village requires arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, along with visual cleanliness.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented *either* solid or liquid waste management systems, not necessarily both.  The criteria allow for flexibility in approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  An ODF Plus Model village requires the implementation of both solid and liquid waste management systems, along with maintaining visual cleanliness and displaying IEC messages.  This represents a higher standard of sanitation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Achieving ODF Plus status doesn't automatically mean achieving ODF Plus Model village status. The latter requires meeting more stringent criteria. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**12. Consider the following statements about the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every organization with more than 50 employees.
2.  The POSH Act defines sexual harassment to include unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature, but excludes online harassment.
3.  The POSH Act allows for monetary settlements to resolve sexual harassment complaints through conciliation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an ICC in every organization with 10 or more employees, not 50.  The threshold for mandatory ICC formation is lower than stated.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment broadly to include unwelcome physical, verbal, or non-verbal conduct of a sexual nature. While the act primarily addresses in-person harassment, the definition’s broad nature could potentially encompass online harassment depending on the specific context and interpretation.  However, the statement is not explicitly true.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The POSH Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation in sexual harassment cases.  This is a key provision aimed at ensuring that victims are not pressured into accepting inadequate compensation.  Therefore, none of the statements are fully correct, although statement 2 is partially correct.  However, as per the criteria, option (b) is the closest to the correct answer.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. In the PGI 2.0 classification for 2021-22, 'Daksh' was the *highest* grade, not the lowest. The grading system uses a descending order of achievement levels.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGI-D report indeed focuses on key aspects of the school education system, including learning outcomes, classroom teaching practices, and school safety.  This multifaceted approach ensures a comprehensive assessment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. In PGI 2.0, *no* States/UTs attained the highest grade ('Daksh'). This highlights the need for further improvements in school education across the country. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, *removed* the 20-year existence requirement for applying for DTBU status, opening up opportunities for younger institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Institutions granted DTBU status require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils before starting new courses or programs.  This ensures proper oversight and quality control.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCERT has indeed been granted DTBU status, enabling it to offer its own degrees and exercise greater autonomy in academic matters. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act explicitly makes the construction of insanitary latrines an offense, reflecting the legislation's aim to eliminate the conditions that perpetuate manual scavenging. This is a significant detail that distinguishes between a superficial and a thorough understanding of the Act.

Statement 3 is correct. The PEMSR Act includes comprehensive provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, encompassing training for alternate employment, financial assistance, and support for property acquisition.  This highlights the Act's focus on not just prohibition but also the crucial aspect of rehabilitation and social reintegration.

The number of countries where it operates is also close to the figure mentioned but not exactly 130. Statement 2 is correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal instruments defining the international protection of refugees and form the core of the UNHCR's legal basis and operational framework.  Statement 3 is partially correct in that repatriation is one aspect of UNHCR's work but not the primary or only focus.  The UNHCR's mandate is broader, encompassing protection, assistance, and durable solutions for refugees, which may include resettlement in third countries or local integration.  The focus is on ensuring the rights and well-being of refugees, regardless of their eventual destination.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Census is a Union subject (entry 69 of the Union List) under Article 246 of the Constitution.  While states can conduct their own surveys, the national census is a Union responsibility. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SECC 2011 did collect caste data, but this data was not fully published in 2016. The caste data from the SECC remains unpublished.  Only other data were published. Statement 3 is correct. Bihar's caste survey was an initiative undertaken by the state government independently of the national census process, highlighting the state's autonomy in data collection on social issues.

IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Geneva, Switzerland.  Geneva is the headquarters of other UN organizations. Statement 3 is incorrect. IFPRI's work focuses on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition globally, with a significant emphasis on low- and middle-income countries, not solely high-income nations.  Its research directly addresses food security challenges in developing nations. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.  The question tests factual recall about IFPRI's founding year, location, and target regions for its research initiatives.

The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents that underpin the UNHCR's work and define its mandate regarding the protection of refugees. Statement 3 is correct. The UNHCR's 2022 report did indeed highlight a substantial increase (21%) in forced displacement compared to the previous year. This demonstrates the growing global refugee crisis.  The question tests knowledge of the UNHCR's founding year, location, core legal framework, and key findings from its recent reports. The incorrect options offer plausible but incorrect information about the organization's history, legal basis, and activities, emphasizing the need for precise factual recall.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with SC welfare, the Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry for ST welfare.  The responsibilities are divided between two ministries. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While SCs generally have a larger population than STs in absolute terms at the national level, this is not true for all states. There are states where the ST population surpasses that of SCs. Statement 3 is correct. The Constitution does indeed mandate reservation of seats for SCs and STs in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies to ensure their representation in the political process. The question tests knowledge of the governmental structure related to SC and ST welfare and their constitutional safeguards.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  The number of countries where it operates is also slightly different from the statement. Statement 2 is incorrect; the report was released in 2023, not 2022, and the number of forcibly displaced people and percentage increase are not precisely accurate.  While the report highlighted forced displacement and the impact of social and climate crises, the provided figures are slightly off.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the UNHCR's mandate, including its work based on the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring careful evaluation of details within each statement.  The incorrect options contain plausible but slightly inaccurate details, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1995, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington D.C. The number of member institutions is also slightly different. Statement 2 contains inaccuracies.  While GANHRI does review and accredit NHRIs based on the Paris Principles (adopted in 1993), the accreditation cycle is five years, not six. The statement about the NHRC's accreditation deferral is correct, but the precise reasons given need to be reviewed. Statement 3 correctly describes GANHRI's General Assembly and overall mission.  Therefore, only statement 3 is completely accurate. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills, demanding precision in identifying inaccuracies within seemingly correct statements.  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately false information, increasing the question's difficulty.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII was established in 2000 by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN General Assembly, and its headquarters are in New York, not Geneva.  Statement 2 is largely correct.  The number of experts is 16, not 18, with 8 nominated by governments and 8 by indigenous organizations.  Its mandate accurately reflects the statement's description. Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the UNPFII's activities are supported by a Trust Fund, it is one of three, not four, UN bodies specifically mandated to address Indigenous Peoples' issues.  Therefore, only statement 2 is largely correct, although with slight variations in the numbers. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring careful attention to detail in evaluating the accuracy of each statement.  The incorrect options contain plausible but slightly inaccurate information, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge.

2. Caste-wise enumeration was conducted regularly from 1881 to 1931 under British rule and resumed after independence, except for data on Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 collected caste data, but its publication was delayed.
3. The Bihar state government recently released a report on a caste survey conducted in the state, despite the Census being a Union subject, illustrating the ongoing debate about collecting caste-based data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Census is a Union subject (Entry 69 of the Union List), not a State subject, under Article 246 of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While caste-wise enumeration was carried out under British rule, it was discontinued after independence, with only data on SCs and STs being collected regularly.  The SECC did collect caste data in 2011, but only the socio-economic data was eventually released.  Statement 3 correctly highlights the Bihar government's release of a caste survey report and the ongoing debate surrounding the collection and publication of caste-based data.  Therefore, only statement 3 is fully accurate. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the constitutional provisions related to the Census and the complexities surrounding caste data collection in India.  The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate details about the constitutional position of the Census and the history of caste-based enumeration, increasing the question's difficulty.

The inclusion of a foreign language is not a mandatory requirement.

Statement 3 is correct.  NCF-SE explicitly aims to integrate contributions to knowledge from various disciplines by Indians across different historical periods, enriching the curriculum and fostering a sense of national pride and identity. This integration is a key feature of the framework's approach.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGI classifies States/UTs and districts into ten grades based solely on data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+).
2.  In the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, none of the States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh"), and only two States/UTs achieved the grade "Prachesta-1".
3.  PGI-D, a combined report for 2020-21 and 2021-22, focuses exclusively on quantitative data related to student enrollment and infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UDISE+ data is a crucial component of the PGI assessment, it is not the *sole* basis.  The PGI also incorporates data from the National Achievement Survey (NAS), which assesses student learning outcomes.  Therefore, the PGI's evaluation is multi-faceted, not solely reliant on UDISE+.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement is partially correct in that no State/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0 for 2021-22. However, it is inaccurate to say that only two States/UTs achieved "Prachesta-1". The correct information states that Punjab and Chandigarh achieved "Prachesta-2", the highest grade attained.

Statement 3 is incorrect. PGI-D considers a broader range of factors than just quantitative data on enrollment and infrastructure.  It includes qualitative aspects such as effective classroom transactions and school safety, providing a more comprehensive assessment of the school education system at the district level.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCrF is a framework that only integrates credits earned through higher education and vocational training.
2.  The NCrF fixes total notional learning hours for school, college, vocational, and skill education at 1000 hours per year.
3.  The NCrF aims to ensure flexibility and mobility among different educational pathways by integrating credits earned through various educational programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCrF is designed to be an *inclusive* framework that integrates credits earned not just from higher education and vocational training, but also from school education.  Its comprehensive nature is a key feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF sets the total notional learning hours at 1200 hours per year, not 1000.  This detail is a crucial element of the framework's structure and functioning.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCrF's primary goal is to enhance flexibility and mobility within the educational system by establishing a mechanism for credit transfer and accumulation across different educational pathways (school, higher education, vocational, and skill education).


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Institutions less than 10 years old are eligible to apply for DtbU status under the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023.
2.  Under the 2023 regulations, a cluster of institutions managed by a single sponsoring body can apply for DtbU status.
3.  Institutions granted DtbU status are mandated to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for all their students.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old, not 10 years old, to apply for DtbU status. This change is a significant aspect of the updated regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations allow for clusters of institutions managed by *more than one* sponsoring body to apply for DtbU status, not just a single one.  This reflects a shift towards greater flexibility and collaboration.

Statement 3 is correct.  The 2023 regulations mandate that institutions granted DtbU status must create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores to digital lockers. This is a crucial component of the digitalization and credit transfer system.


**5. With reference to the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) National Indicator Framework (NIF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIF includes only indicators that align with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF) indicators.
2.  The NIF, 2023, comprises exactly 250 indicators.
3.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and circulating guidelines to States/UTs for the development of State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the NIF aligns with the GIF, it also includes indicators specifically tailored to India's context and needs.  It's not a direct replication of the GIF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NIF, 2023, contains 284 indicators, not 250. This number reflects the comprehensive nature of the framework.

Statement 3 is correct. MoSPI is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for developing and circulating guidelines for the States/UTs to create their own SIFs, ensuring a coordinated approach to SDG monitoring and implementation across the country.


**6. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023 ranks India among the top 20 countries with the lowest levels of hunger.
2.  The GHI 2023 uses data on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  The GHI is released annually by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 ranks India at 111th out of 125 countries, indicating a serious hunger situation, not among the top 20 with the lowest levels of hunger.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI does indeed use data on undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality as key indicators to assess the severity of hunger.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WFP.  This is an important distinction to remember.


**7. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is solely administered by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium with no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system falls under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs receive both a fixed monthly honorarium and performance-linked incentives, reflecting the importance of their work and accountability.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While improving the nutritional status of young children is a core objective, Saksham Anganwadi also addresses other aspects, such as early childhood care and education, and extends its focus to adolescent girls in certain regions.


**8. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Act mandates that the ICC must settle all complaints through conciliation, preventing legal action.
3.  The Act ensures complete anonymity of the complainant, respondent, and witnesses throughout the process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ICC can receive complaints from women working in organizations with fewer than 10 workers as well; a local committee is established in such cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While conciliation is encouraged, the ICC can also initiate inquiries and recommend action, including legal recourse, if conciliation fails.  The Act doesn't mandate only conciliation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act prioritizes the confidentiality and privacy of all involved parties, including complainants, respondents, and witnesses, to protect them from potential harm or stigmatization.


**9. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed by government agencies to clean human waste.
2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a year of its enactment.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternate employment and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, including those employed by private entities or individuals, not limited to government agencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act doesn't mandate the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe; it sets out a process for their phased elimination and conversion into sanitary latrines.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act explicitly provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through measures such as training for alternative employment, financial assistance, and help in acquiring property.  Rehabilitation is a central component.


**10. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to oversee the implementation of the Act.
3. The Act prohibits surrogacy for same-sex couples.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act explicitly permits only altruistic surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy. This is a fundamental aspect of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the NARTSB to monitor and regulate the surrogacy process, ensuring ethical practices and protecting the rights of all involved.

Statement 3 is correct, though not explicitly stated in the provided text, the act does not permit surrogacy for same-sex couples as it focuses on intending couples.  The focus on traditional family structures implicitly excludes same-sex couples.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding Madhya Pradesh.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the criteria used to identify PVTGs.  These groups are characterized by their traditional lifestyles, limited access to education and resources, and often demographic challenges. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs, Madhya Pradesh holds the highest number in absolute terms. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating its presence across multiple states.


**2. With reference to the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
2.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs, comprising 15 crore Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act and its replacement.  The act's discriminatory nature led to its eventual abolishment. Statement 2 is incorrect; the relationship is the other way around – all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  The DNTs represent a specific subset of nomadic communities historically targeted by the Criminal Tribes Act. Statement 3 is correct in its estimation of the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, though the precise figures may vary depending on the source and methodology.


**3. With reference to government initiatives for the welfare of DNTs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) is responsible for preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs.
2.  The Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on providing free competitive exam coaching to DNTs students.
3.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) includes providing health insurance to families.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the NCDNT's mandate. The commission plays a crucial role in identifying and documenting DNT communities. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Nanaji Deshmukh Scheme focuses on constructing hostels for DNT boys and girls, not providing competitive exam coaching.  That aspect is covered under a different scheme. Statement 3 is correct; SEED aims to improve the socioeconomic conditions of DNT communities, and health insurance is one of its components.


**4.  With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act establishes special courts in every district for faster adjudication of cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the Act mandates a minimum of 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions, this reservation does *not* apply to police forces. Statement 2 accurately reflects the Act's comprehensive definition of disabilities. Statement 3 is also correct; the Act aims to expedite the legal process for PwDs by establishing special courts.


**5. With reference to Manual Scavenging and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed to clean human waste from insanitary latrines without appropriate protective gear.
2.  The Act makes it an offence to construct insanitary latrines but not to employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
3.  The Act outlines a rehabilitation process for manual scavengers, including training in alternate employment and financial assistance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the definition of manual scavengers in the PEMSR Act is broader, encompassing various situations involving the handling of human excreta. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act makes it an offense to both construct insanitary latrines and employ people to clean sewers and septic tanks without proper safety measures. Statement 3 accurately describes the Act's provisions for the rehabilitation and social reintegration of manual scavengers.


**6. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.

(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while India's ranking is concerning, the provided text does not explicitly state whether it is lower than the South Asia average.  More data would be needed to confirm this. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GHI uses multiple data sources, not solely the NFHS.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the improvement in India's GHI score between 2015 and 2023 is described as slight, not significant.


**9. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Index is published by the World Economic Forum, not the UNDP.  Statement 2 is correct; India's 2023 ranking was 127 out of 146, which is below 100. Statement 3 accurately lists the four parameters used in the index.


**10. With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNPFII is a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly.
2.  The UNPFII's membership comprises 16 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations.
3. The UNPFII's activities are solely funded by mandatory contributions from UN member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

Statement 2 accurately describes the UNPFII's membership composition. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UNPFII's activities are supported by a trust fund, not solely mandatory contributions.  Funding comes from voluntary donations.



**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based design for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage structure.
2.  NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least two Indian languages.
3. NCF-SE introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as either "Accredited" or "Not Accredited".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, aiming for a more holistic and flexible approach compared to the previous four-stage system.  This restructuring aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020's vision.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The framework strongly emphasizes multilingualism, aiming to promote proficiency in at least three languages, with a focus on Indian languages. This reflects a commitment to preserving linguistic diversity and promoting effective communication within a multilingual nation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. NCF-SE focuses on curriculum and pedagogy for schools, not directly on the accreditation system.  The accreditation of schools is a separate process managed by different bodies and frameworks, such as the National Accreditation Board for Education and Training (NABET).  While NCF-SE may indirectly influence school quality and thus impact accreditation outcomes, it does not itself establish a binary accreditation system for schools.  The binary system is a proposal related to Higher Education Institutions, not schools.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs is based solely on the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 data.
2.  In PGI 2.0, Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the highest grade, "Daksh".
3. The PGI-D report combines data from 2019-20 and 2020-21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) None
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs utilizes data from both the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021. It's a composite index, not solely reliant on NAS data.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  No State/UT achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0. The top grade attained was "Prachesta-2," achieved by Punjab and Chandigarh.  The question deliberately misrepresents the highest grade achieved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report combines data from 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21.  This subtle alteration in the years makes the statement factually inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1.  NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education using the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) exclusively.
2.  NCrF fixes the total notional learning hours for all levels of education at 1200 hours per year.
3.  NCrF allows multiple entry and exit options, enabling lifelong learning through credit transfer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NCrF does use the NHEQF, it also integrates credits from the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).  The statement wrongly claims exclusive reliance on NHEQF.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF does indeed standardize the notional learning hours across different educational levels at 1200 hours per year. This standardization is crucial for credit transfer and integration.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key feature of NCrF is its flexibility, providing multiple entry and exit points.  This allows individuals to pursue education at their own pace and accumulate credits across various educational pathways, promoting lifelong learning.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, require institutions to be at least 20 years old to apply for DtBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status can start new courses without any prior approval.
3.  The NCERT has recently been granted DtBU status, allowing it to offer its own graduate and postgraduate degrees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations actually lowered the age requirement.  Institutions less than 20 years old are now eligible to apply for DtBU status, unlike the previous 2019 regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  DtBUs require prior approval from their Executive Council and relevant statutory councils to introduce new courses or programs.  The statement incorrectly suggests unrestricted autonomy in this matter.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCERT has recently been granted DtBU status, enabling it to independently offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs, enhancing its autonomy in curriculum design, examinations, and management.


**5. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FHEIs require UGC approval before establishing campuses in India but not for offering specific programs.
2.  FHEIs ranked within the top 1000 globally are eligible to establish campuses in India.
3.  FHEIs are permitted to offer programs in online or open and distance learning modes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  FHEIs need UGC approval for both establishing campuses and offering programs in India.  The statement incorrectly suggests a distinction in approval requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The eligibility criterion for FHEIs is being ranked within the top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise) or possessing outstanding expertise in a particular area.  The statement uses an inflated ranking threshold (1000 instead of 500).

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The regulations explicitly prohibit FHEIs from offering programs in online, open, and distance learning modes.  The statement contradicts this regulatory restriction.


**6. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific needs in addition to those aligned with the global SDG indicators.
2. The NIF, 2023, comprises fewer than 200 indicators.
3.  The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and circulating guidelines for State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NIF incorporates both global SDG indicators and indicators specifically designed to address India's unique circumstances and priorities. This ensures a more context-specific and relevant monitoring mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NIF, 2023, actually contains 284 indicators, significantly more than 200.  The statement provides an artificially low number of indicators.

Statement 3 is correct. MoSPI plays a crucial role in coordinating the development and dissemination of guidelines for SIFs across different states and union territories, promoting consistency and comparability in SDG monitoring.


**7. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is solely under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW).
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed honorarium but no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used to monitor nutrition service delivery and identify malnutrition prevalence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not MoHFW. Although there is collaboration between the ministries, the primary administrative responsibility lies with MoWCD.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AWWs do receive a fixed monthly honorarium, and also a performance-linked incentive for utilizing the ICDS-CAS system under POSHAN Abhiyaan.  The statement omits the crucial aspect of performance-based incentives.

Statement 3 is correct. The Poshan Tracker app is a key tool for real-time monitoring of nutrition services, enabling early identification of children suffering from stunting, wasting, or underweight conditions.  It facilitates targeted interventions and enhances the effectiveness of nutrition programs.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023 ranks India higher than 100th position.
2.  The GHI primarily focuses on child mortality rates and adult undernourishment.

A central aspect of the judgment is the need for collaborative efforts to ensure that children in CCIs who haven't seen their parents for over a year, or those with unfit parents or guardians, are considered for adoption.  This aims to provide these children with stable and nurturing homes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The judgment's definition of "unfit" parents is broader than just substance abuse. It includes various factors, such as parental neglect, abuse, criminal records, and inability or unwillingness to provide adequate care.  The definition considers a range of factors indicating parental unsuitability.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The term PVTG replaced the earlier term PTG in 2006.
3.  Criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of STs, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.  Statement 2 is correct; the government renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as PVTGs in 2006. Statement 3 is also correct; these are key criteria used to identify PVTGs, reflecting their unique vulnerabilities and need for targeted support.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the absolute number of STs and the number of PVTGs, a common misunderstanding in discussions about tribal welfare.  The other options incorrectly include statement 1, which is factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which led to the DNT categorization, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship is the other way around: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Statement 2 is correct; the Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act. Statement 3 is also correct, reflecting the Renke Commission's findings on the vast number of nomadic and semi-nomadic communities and DNTs in India.  The question uses a subtle reversal of a factual relationship in statement 1 to create a distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the DNT categorization and its historical context.

2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims.
3.  The Act makes it mandatory for all airlines operating in India to implement its provisions, irrespective of whether they are Indian or foreign.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, indeed specifies reservation quotas for PwDs in education and employment.  It also lists 21 types of disabilities. Importantly, a landmark judgment emphasized the applicability of the RPwD Act to all airlines operating within India, regardless of their origin. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the Act's provisions and their legal implications.  There are no misleading elements, making it a difficult question based purely on factual recall.

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment or a fine of ₹1 lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, with an exception for those using protective gear.
3.  The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines but does not mandate their demolition or conversion within a specified timeframe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act specifies the penalties for violations. Statement 2 is also correct, accurately reflecting the Act's definition of manual scavengers and the exception for those using protective gear. Statement 3, however, is incorrect. The Act does mandate the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Act, its penalties, and the specific definition of manual scavengers, including the crucial exception. The incorrect statement 3 acts as a strong distractor.


**5. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCF recommends a restructuring of school education into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 referring to school education and levels 4.5-8 referring to higher education.
2.  The NCF advocates for a credit system that integrates credits earned through academic, vocational, and skill education, stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC).
3.  The NCF introduces the concept of "notional learning hours," fixing the total for school, college, vocational, and skill education at 1200 hours/year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the NCF does propose a restructuring of education, it doesn't explicitly divide it into eight levels with a rigid demarcation between school and higher education in the way statement 1 suggests.  Statement 2 is correct: The NCF strongly promotes a credit system and the ABC. Statement 3 is also correct; the concept of notional learning hours and the specified number are part of the NCF framework. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the NCF's core tenets, including its credit system and the concept of notional learning hours, while using a slightly misleading statement 1 to introduce difficulty.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of the NCF-SE.  The framework does indeed propose a revised 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, moving away from the older 4-stage system. This restructuring is a core element of its design.  Secondly, the NCF-SE explicitly integrates vocational education into its structure, emphasizing diverse practical skills and experiences categorized as work with life forms, materials and machines, and human services. This is a significant departure from traditional academic-centric curricula. Finally, the NCF-SE suggests a shift to a semester system and allows students to take board exams twice a year for Grades 10 and 12, keeping only the higher score.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the PGI 2.0 utilizes data from both the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.  It's a combination of data sources that provide a comprehensive assessment. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  No state or union territory attained the highest grade ('Daksh') in PGI 2.0; Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the top grade among those assessed, which was 'Prachesta-2'.  The three states mentioned actually received the lowest grade, 'Akanshi-3'. Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D report specifically focuses on the performance of school education systems at the district level, incorporating essential aspects like effective classroom teaching practices and the safety and security of schools. Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using a system of 10 credit levels spanning all three educational pathways.
2.  The NCrF is a framework that includes the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE).
3.  Credits earned under the NCrF are stored in the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC), allowing for flexibility and mobility across various educational sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the NCrF uses an 8-level credit system, not 10.  While it aims to integrate credits across school, higher, and vocational education, the number of levels is 8, encompassing all three educational domains. Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF is explicitly designed to incorporate the NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF-SE, creating a unified credit accumulation and transfer system.  This integration is a crucial feature of the framework. Statement 3 is also correct.  The ABC is indeed the digital repository for credits earned under the NCrF, facilitating the transfer of credits across different educational institutions and programs, promoting flexibility and mobility for learners.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, stipulate that institutions must be operational for at least 20 years to apply for DtBU status.
2.  Institutions granted DtBU status are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.
3.  The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) has recently been granted DtBU status, enabling it to offer its own undergraduate and postgraduate degrees but not doctoral degrees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, have removed the 20-year operational requirement for applying for DtBU status.

1. The UGC regulations allow FHEIs ranked within the top 1000 globally to set up campuses in India.
2. FHEIs operating in India are permitted to offer online and distance learning programs without any restrictions.
3. FHEIs must obtain UGC approval before establishing campuses, offering programs, or discontinuing courses in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC regulations require FHEIs to be ranked within the top 500 globally (overall or subject-wise) to be eligible to establish campuses in India.  The ranking threshold is a key criterion for eligibility. Statement 2 is incorrect. FHEIs are explicitly prohibited from offering online or distance learning programs in India under the current regulations.  This restriction is designed to maintain quality control and ensure compliance with Indian educational standards. Statement 3 is correct.  The UGC regulations clearly state that FHEIs require prior approval from the UGC for all major operational aspects, including campus establishment, program offerings, and course discontinuation.  This regulatory oversight is crucial for maintaining standards and preventing inconsistencies.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the current regulations governing FHEIs in India.

2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe after its enactment.
3.  The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and housing support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those employed to handle human excreta from insanitary latrines. It includes individuals employed to clean sewers and septic tanks without proper safety gear, and also those engaged in similar hazardous tasks.  The definition is more inclusive. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act doesn't mandate the immediate demolition of all insanitary latrines within a set timeframe.  It instead requires local authorities to gradually convert insanitary latrines into sanitary ones, following a phased approach.  The implementation is not immediate and uniform. Statement 3 is correct. The PEMSR Act explicitly addresses the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering provisions for alternative employment training, financial aid, and assistance in acquiring housing.  Rehabilitation is a central focus of the legislation. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately captures the essence of the PEMSR Act.

2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disabilities and those caused by acid attacks.
3. The Act establishes special courts in every district to expedite the adjudication of cases related to disability rights violations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1,2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation for persons with disabilities in government jobs, not 5%, and this reservation does not apply to police forces.  The percentage and the specific exclusion are important details. Statement 2 is correct. The Act indeed recognizes 21 types of disabilities, encompassing a wide range of conditions, including intellectual disabilities and those resulting from acid attacks. The comprehensive list is a key feature. Statement 3 is correct. The RPwD Act does provide for the establishment of special courts in every district to handle cases involving disability rights violations more efficiently. The aim is to ensure quicker justice.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are fully accurate representations of the RPwD Act's provisions.

All three statements accurately describe aspects of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin) and its ODF and ODF Plus initiatives.  The primary aim of the mission is to achieve ODF status in all villages by providing and promoting access to individual household toilets. This forms the foundation of the program. The ODF Plus status builds upon this by requiring the sustained ODF status and the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management, showing a higher level of sanitation.  The ODF Plus Model village adds further criteria, including both solid and liquid waste management systems, visual cleanliness, and the display of IEC messages, representing the highest level of sanitation achievement.  Therefore, all three statements correctly represent the goals and criteria of the Swachh Bharat Mission (Gramin).


**14. With reference to the  Universal Health Coverage (UHC), consider the following statements:**

1. UHC aims to ensure that all individuals have access to a full range of quality health services without facing financial hardship.
2.  Key dimensions of UHC include accessibility, affordability, and quality of health services.
3.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a government initiative exclusively aimed at achieving UHC through tertiary healthcare services.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  UHC's core objective is to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare without incurring significant financial burden. This is the fundamental principle. Statement 2 is also correct. Accessibility, affordability, and quality are indeed the three key dimensions that define UHC.  These aspects are essential for effective healthcare delivery. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a broad initiative aimed at improving healthcare across primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.  It is not exclusively focused on tertiary healthcare services. Its scope is much wider.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate descriptions of UHC.


**15. With reference to the  Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth, and Sports, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee recently submitted a report on the implementation of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 in higher education.
2.  The Committee's report highlighted the complete and successful implementation of all aspects of NEP 2020.
3.  The Committee's report focused solely on the financial aspects of implementing NEP 2020.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Education, Women, Children, Youth, and Sports did recently submit a report on the implementation of NEP 2020 in higher education. This is a matter of public record. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Committee's report would not have highlighted the complete and successful implementation of *all* aspects of NEP 2020.  Implementation of such a large-scale policy is a complex and ongoing process, with challenges and varying degrees of success across different areas.  To claim complete success would be inaccurate. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Committee's report would have addressed a broad range of issues related to the implementation of NEP 2020, not just financial aspects.  It would have encompassed pedagogical, infrastructural, and other important aspects.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 curricular and pedagogical structure, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  The NCF-SE mandates the inclusion of at least three languages in the curriculum, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. Board examinations for grades 10 and 12 will be conducted only once a year, with no provision for re-takes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups (3-8, 8-11, 11-14, 14-18 years) instead of the previous four-stage system. This restructuring aims to better align the curriculum with child development stages and learning needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages, it doesn't mandate a foreign language.  The framework promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with a preference for at least two Indian languages. This approach aims to preserve linguistic diversity and promote cognitive development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCF-SE allows students to take board examinations for grades 10 and 12 on at least two occasions during any given school year.  This provision aims to reduce examination stress and provide students with more opportunities to demonstrate their learning.  The best score obtained will be recorded.  This flexibility promotes a more supportive learning environment.


**2. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF frameworks.

3.  The NCrF allows for multiple entry and exit points in the education system, enabling lifelong learning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF's core objective is to create a unified credit system that seamlessly integrates credits earned across different educational pathways (school, higher, and vocational).  It achieves this by encompassing the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF).  This integration enhances flexibility and mobility for learners.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCrF does establish a credit system but doesn't mandate a uniform 1000 notional learning hours per year across all levels. The total notional learning hours are actually 1200 hours/year, and this can vary based on the specific level and type of education.  The focus is on credit accumulation, not strict hour requirements.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCrF explicitly supports multiple entry and exit points, enabling students to enter and re-enter the education system at various stages, promoting lifelong learning opportunities. This flexibility allows individuals to adapt their education to changing circumstances and career goals.


**3. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for School Education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at the state and district levels using UDISE+ data and NAS results.
2. In the PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, all states and union territories achieved at least the 'Uttam' grade.
3. The PGI-D report combines data from 2020-21 and 2021-22, focusing on outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PGI is designed to evaluate the performance of school education systems at both the state and district levels.  It leverages data from the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) to provide a comprehensive assessment of educational outcomes and quality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. In the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22, none of the states or union territories attained the highest grade ('Daksh'). The top grade achieved was 'Prachesta-2,' by Punjab and Chandigarh.  Several states received the lowest grade ('Akanshi-3').  This highlights the significant variations in educational performance across different regions.

Statement 3 is correct. The PGI-D report integrates data from both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 academic years to provide a more comprehensive picture of district-level performance.  Its assessment goes beyond simple metrics, considering factors like effective classroom transactions and school safety, reflecting a holistic approach to educational evaluation.



**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (NRF) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NRF's funding primarily comes from central government grants and loans, along with income earned from investments.  While donations are accepted, they are not the primary source of funding. This structure ensures the NRF's financial stability and independence in promoting research and innovation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NRF does indeed subsume the SERB, integrating its functions and resources. However, the DST is not abolished; it continues to function as the administrative department for the NRF.  The DST plays a crucial role in overseeing the NRF's operations and ensuring its effective implementation.

Statement 3 is correct. The Governing Board of the NRF includes ex-officio members from the Prime Minister's Science, Technology, and Innovation Council. This ensures high-level policy guidance and strategic alignment with national priorities.  The inclusion of diverse expertise from various sectors, including the business world and academia, is also ensured.


**5. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  The new regulations for DTBUs mandate that all such institutions must offer at least one program in a STEM field.
3.  Institutions seeking DTBU status must create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant change introduced by the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, is the reduction of the minimum age requirement for applying for DTBU status from 20 years to less than 20 years. This opens up opportunities for younger, high-performing institutions to achieve DTBU status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The new regulations do not mandate that DTBUs must offer programs in STEM fields. While they encourage quality and excellence across disciplines, there's no specific requirement to offer STEM programs.  The focus is on overall academic quality and research capabilities.

Statement 3 is correct.  The regulations now make it compulsory for DTBUs to create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores digitally. This promotes transparency and enhances the portability of academic credits, aligning with the broader goals of the National Credit Framework.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

2. The RPwD Act makes it mandatory for all airlines operating in India to implement its provisions regarding accessibility for PwDs.
3. The RPwD Act excludes police forces (including the Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi Police) from its reservation provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RPwD Act, 2016, clearly stipulates a minimum of 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in higher educational institutions that are either government-run or receive government aid.  This provision aims to improve access to higher education for PwDs.

Statement 2 is correct.  A landmark judgment by the Office of Chief Commissioner of Persons with Disabilities (OCCPD) affirmed that all airlines operating within India (both domestic and international) are legally obligated to fully implement the accessibility provisions of the RPwD Act.  This ruling significantly enhances air travel accessibility for PwDs.

Statement 3 is correct.  The RPwD Act's reservation provisions do not extend to police forces.  This exclusion is a specific provision within the Act itself, highlighting a complex interplay between disability rights and the specific operational requirements of law enforcement agencies.  This exception doesn't diminish the broader commitment of the Act to promoting inclusivity.


**7. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle any form of human waste, regardless of the use of protective gear.
2. The PEMSR Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe after its enactment.
3.  The PEMSR Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance, including help with property purchase.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act carefully defines manual scavengers, excluding those who handle human waste while using appropriate protective gear and equipment. This distinction is crucial because the Act aims to eliminate hazardous manual scavenging, not all forms of waste handling.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PEMSR Act doesn't mandate the immediate demolition of all insanitary latrines within a fixed timeframe.  It emphasizes the conversion of insanitary latrines into sanitary ones, but the implementation timeline is flexible and depends on local circumstances and resource availability.  A phased approach is usually adopted.

Statement 3 is correct. The PEMSR Act strongly emphasizes the rehabilitation of manual scavengers. It provides for alternative employment opportunities, financial assistance, and support in acquiring property, aiming to help them transition into dignified and safe livelihoods.  This rehabilitation component is integral to the Act's overall goal of eradicating manual scavenging.


**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

3. The UNFPA publishes the annual "State of World Population" report.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNFPA's headquarters are in New York City, USA, not Geneva, Switzerland.  Geneva is home to several other important UN agencies, but the UNFPA is based in New York.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UNFPA has set ambitious targets to achieve "three zeros" by 2030. These goals aim to eliminate unmet needs for family planning, preventable maternal mortality, and gender-based violence and harmful practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, and operates in 137 countries, not over 120.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed the cornerstones of UNHCR's legal framework.  While the conventions primarily address refugees fleeing persecution,  the UNHCR's mandate has expanded in practice to address situations of mass displacement caused by various factors, including environmental disasters. The legal framework itself, however, may not explicitly cover all these situations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. UNHCR's mandate extends to assisting stateless persons. However,  internally displaced persons (IDPs), who are forced to flee their homes but remain within their own country's borders, are not directly under the UNHCR's mandate. Other UN agencies often take the lead in assisting IDPs.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Paris, and it has 120 member NHRIs, not over 100.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  GANHRI does accredit NHRIs based on the Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, but the review and accreditation process occurs every five years, not ten.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that GANHRI deferred the accreditation of the NHRC on two occasions, citing concerns such as political interference and lack of cooperation with civil society.

(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sports are listed in Entry 33 of List II (State List) of the Constitution, placing primary responsibility with state governments.  The Union Government plays a significant role, but the primary authority resides at the state level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While MYAS plays a crucial role in promoting sports through institutions like SAI, it does not directly oversee all aspects of sports governance.  National sports federations have a degree of autonomy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IOA is involved in the participation of Indian athletes in international competitions, but it does not have sole responsibility. The MYAS and the national sports federations also play significant roles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting in identified districts with the highest malnutrition burden, not to eradicate malnutrition nationwide. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NNM's focus extends to pregnant women, mothers, and children, not just children aged 0-6 years. Statement 3 is correct.

3. ANMs receive a fixed monthly honorarium decided by the Centre, while ASHAs receive only task/activity-based incentives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AWWs focus on early childhood care and development, while ANMs focus on maternal and child health, including immunizations.  Both may have some overlap, but the statement's simplification is misleading. Statement 2 is incorrect. ASHAs play a role in both awareness creation and linking individuals to curative services and supplies. Statement 3 is incorrect. While ANMs receive a fixed honorarium, ASHAs receive a combination of fixed monthly incentives and task-based incentives.  The roles and compensation structures of these community health workers are more nuanced than presented in the statements.

(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has a high population of Scheduled Tribes (STs) overall, Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs.  The question plays on the distinction between the overall ST population and the specifically designated PVTGs.  Many candidates might confuse the larger ST population of Madhya Pradesh with the number of PVTGs.

Statement 2 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs explicitly include the factors mentioned: pre-agricultural technology, low literacy rates, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  These factors reflect the vulnerability and isolation of these groups.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The shift to the 5+3+3+4 structure is a core element of the NCF-SE's restructuring of school education.

    Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those handling human excreta from insanitary latrines *without* protective gear. It mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines but doesn't specify a rigid timeframe. It does provide for rehabilitation through alternative employment. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.




**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include a pre-agricultural level of technology, high levels of literacy, and significant economic advancement.
2.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India, exceeding the number found in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs actually include a pre-agricultural level of technology, *low* levels of literacy, and *economic backwardness*, along with a declining or stagnant population.  The statement reverses the economic and literacy aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Odisha does have a high number of PVTGs (13), the text explicitly states that Madhya Pradesh has the highest population of STs in absolute numbers. The question misleads by implying a direct correlation between highest number of PVTGs and highest ST population.  Further, the number of PVTGs in Madhya Pradesh is not specified, leaving the comparison ambiguous.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in *both* Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.  This directly contradicts the statement's assertion of exclusivity.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, and all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," remains in effect today.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clarifies that while all DNTs are nomadic tribes, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. This indicates a subset relationship, not complete equivalence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. The statement incorrectly presents the act as still being in force.

Statement 3 is correct. The Renke Commission's estimate of approximately 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic/semi-nomadic tribes is accurately reflected in the provided text.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government jobs and at least 4% reservation in government-aided higher educational institutions.

3.  The Act mandates the establishment of a special court in every district for the faster adjudication of cases under the Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs and at least 5% reservation in government/government-aided higher educational institutions.  The percentages are reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly includes intellectual disability and acid attack victims among the 21 types of disabilities it recognizes.  The statement creates a misleading exclusion.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act does indeed mandate the establishment of a special court in every district for the faster adjudication of cases.


**4. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, allows for the employment of individuals to clean human waste if appropriate protective gear is used.
2.  The Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines, but it does not mandate their demolition or conversion within a specified timeframe.
3.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) provides financial assistance but does not offer training in alternative employment or help with property purchases.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act does allow for cleaning human waste with appropriate protective gear, providing an exception to the ban on manual scavenging.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act does mandate the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a certain period.  The statement omits this crucial aspect of the legislation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SRMS scheme is described in the text as providing rehabilitation through training in alternate employment, financial help, and assistance with property purchases. The statement incorrectly limits its provisions.


**5. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1.  NEP 2020 aims for a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education of at least 25% by 2035.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 25%, by 2035. The statement underestimates the policy's ambition.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of MERUs is a key component of NEP 2020 to foster interdisciplinary learning and research.

Statement 3 is correct. NEP 2020 does indeed propose the creation of NETF to leverage technology for improved education.


**6. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCrF divides education into 6 levels, with levels 1-3 referring to school education and levels 4-6 referring to higher education.
2.  Credits earned through vocational education and training can be stored in the Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) but cannot be integrated with credits from school or higher education.
3.  The NCrF introduces the concept of "notional learning hours" to standardize the time required for different types of education.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 6, with levels 1-4 for school education and levels 4.5-8 for higher education. The statement undercounts the framework's levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCrF explicitly aims to integrate credits from school, higher education, and vocational training, with all credits stored and transferable through the ABC. The statement misrepresents this key integrative function.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCrF does introduce the concept of notional learning hours to provide a standardized measure of learning time across different educational pathways.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the Bihar government termed the exercise a "social survey" rather than a full-scale population census conducted under the Census Act of 1948.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately reports that the Bihar state government undertook the survey following a resolution from the state legislature.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage states the survey focused on caste demographics, distinguishing it from the more comprehensive socio-economic data collection of past censuses.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchsheel Principles for tribal development:**

1.  The principles emphasize the imposition of alien values to accelerate tribal development.
2.  The principles advocate for the disregard of tribal rights to land and forests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Panchsheel principles explicitly advocate *against* the imposition of alien values, emphasizing development aligned with tribal genius.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The principles strongly emphasize *respecting* tribal rights to land and forests.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that GANHRI has *deferred* the NHRC's accreditation on multiple occasions, citing various concerns.

Statement 2 is correct.  The loss of accreditation would prevent the NHRC from representing India at the UN Human Rights Council.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions political interference and poor cooperation with civil society among the objections raised by GANHRI against the NHRC.



**1. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules explicitly permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete belongs to the intending couple.
2. Single women (widows or divorcees) seeking surrogacy are permitted to use donor sperm but must utilize their own eggs.
3.  Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is genetically related to the child, is explicitly legalized under these rules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules allows surrogacy with donor gametes, but only under the condition that at least one gamete originates from the intending couple.  This is a significant change from the previous rules, which prohibited the use of donor gametes entirely.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The amendment specifically addresses the case of single women undergoing surrogacy, stipulating that they must use their own eggs and can utilize donor sperm. This reflects a nuanced approach to regulating surrogacy for different circumstances.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its subsequent amendments primarily focus on gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child. Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate is the biological mother, remains largely prohibited under the current legal framework in India.  The amendments do not legalize this form of surrogacy.


**2. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act extended the permissible gestational age for abortion up to 28 weeks for all women, regardless of circumstances.
2.  The Act permits abortion beyond 24 weeks only in cases of substantial foetal abnormalities, as determined by a medical board.
3.  The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling extended the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks to unmarried and single women, including in cases of marital rape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act did *not* extend the permissible gestational age to 28 weeks for all women. While it expanded access for certain categories of women up to 24 weeks,  the limit for abortion based on foetal abnormalities remains subject to a medical board's assessment and is generally not extended beyond 24 weeks.

Statement 2 is correct.  The MTP Act, as amended, allows for termination of pregnancy beyond 24 weeks only under specific circumstances involving substantial foetal abnormalities, and this requires the opinion of a medical board.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's 2022 ruling clarified that the right to safe and legal abortion up to 24 weeks applies to unmarried and single women, and importantly, it included cases of marital rape within the scope of permissible reasons for abortion.


**3. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines domestic violence to encompass only physical and sexual abuse, excluding emotional and economic abuse.
2.  A complaint under the PWDVA can only be filed by the aggrieved woman herself and not by any other person on her behalf.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA has a broad definition of domestic violence, explicitly including physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  It aims to address the multifaceted nature of domestic violence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PWDVA allows for complaints to be filed not only by the aggrieved woman but also by a Protection Officer or any other person acting on her behalf, particularly if she is unable to do so herself. This recognizes the potential need for support in filing such complaints.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PWDVA primarily provides for civil remedies, it does not preclude the initiation of criminal proceedings against perpetrators.  The remedies under the PWDVA are in addition to any other legal recourse available under other laws, including criminal laws.


**4. With reference to the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) Scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The NCLP is a State-sponsored scheme primarily focused on providing vocational training to children who have been rescued from exploitative labor.
2.  The scheme includes provisions for establishing Special Schools/Rehabilitation Centres to aid in the rehabilitation of child laborers.
3. The NCLP scheme is managed and implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCLP does involve vocational training as part of rehabilitation,  it's not solely focused on that aspect. The scheme's broader goal is to rescue and rehabilitate child laborers, which encompasses education, healthcare, and social integration in addition to vocational skills.

Statement 2 is correct. A key component of the NCLP is the establishment of Special Schools and Rehabilitation Centres, providing a structured environment for the education, skill development, and overall well-being of rescued children.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCLP scheme falls under the purview of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  While both ministries work towards child welfare, the NCLP specifically targets the issue of child labor.


**5. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a 'child' as any person below the age of 16 years.
2. The Act introduced a provision allowing children aged 16-18 years to be tried as adults in cases involving heinous offences.
3. Appeals against adoption orders issued by the Child Welfare Committees are not permitted under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.  This is a crucial definition that shapes the legal framework for dealing with juvenile offenders.

Statement 2 is correct.  A significant aspect of the 2015 Act is the provision that allows for children in the 16-18 age group to be tried as adults in cases involving heinous crimes. This provision has been a subject of debate and discussion.

Statement 3 is correct.  The original 2015 Act did not allow for appeals against adoption orders made by Child Welfare Committees.  However, subsequent amendments may have changed this.  The statement remains correct based on the original Act.


**6. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines manual scavengers to include only those who handle human excreta from insanitary latrines without any protective gear.
2.  The Act mandates local authorities to construct only community sanitary latrines and prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines entirely.
3. The Act makes it an offense to employ individuals as manual scavengers, even if they use appropriate protective gear and equipment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, encompassing those employed to handle human excreta from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of whether they use protective gear or not.  The focus is on the nature of the work, not just the absence of safety measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act strongly encourages the construction and maintenance of sanitary latrines, it doesn't outright prohibit the existence of insanitary latrines.  The focus is on phasing them out and providing alternative sanitation solutions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act makes it an offence to employ individuals as manual scavengers *without* appropriate protective gear and equipment.  If appropriate safety measures are in place, the employment itself is not inherently illegal.

1.  It is released annually by the World Economic Forum and ranks countries based on four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
2.  It assesses the systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by girls and women worldwide across four dimensions: Political, Educational, Economic, and Physical Integrity.
3.  India's 2023 ranking reflects a significant improvement in women's representation in local governance, exceeding 50%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Gender Social Norms Index is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Economic Forum. The World Economic Forum releases the Global Gender Gap Index, which uses different parameters. Statement 2 accurately describes the purpose and dimensions of the Gender Social Norms Index. Statement 3 is incorrect. While India has achieved significant progress in women's representation in local governance,  the provided text states it is at 44.4%, not exceeding 50%.  The index focuses on broader societal norms and attitudes impacting women, not solely on political representation.  The question tests factual recall about the releasing agency and the precise percentage of women's representation in local governance, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of these indices.  The distractors are plausible as both indices deal with gender equality, but their specific features are distinct.


**2. With reference to the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCI tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes indicator categories focusing on maternal and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases, and service capacity and access.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the components of the UHC SCI.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the provided text indicates India's score *declined* from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021, showing a slight setback, not improvement. Statement 3 accurately describes the scoring system of the SCI.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the UHC SCI's components and India's performance trend. The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but incorrect statement about India's score improvement acts as a significant distractor. The other options are incorrect due to the factual inaccuracy regarding India’s score change.

1. The report indicates that forced displacement worldwide in 2022 was lower than in 2021, reflecting a global decrease in conflict and persecution.
2.  The report highlights that a significant proportion of forcibly displaced persons are children, constituting over 30% of the total.
3. The report shows that low- and middle-income countries host the majority (over 75%) of the world's refugees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report actually shows that forced displacement in 2022 was significantly *higher* than in 2021. Statement 2 accurately reflects the report's finding that children constitute a substantial portion of the forcibly displaced population. Statement 3 is also correct, indicating that low- and middle-income countries bear the brunt of hosting refugees. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key findings of the UNHCR report. The incorrect statement about a decrease in displacement serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail and ability to discern factual accuracy.

1. The report attributes the rise in food insecurity during 2020-2022 primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic, with other factors playing a minor role.
2. The report predicts that climate change will exacerbate food insecurity, potentially leading to a substantial increase in undernourished individuals by 2050.
3. The report indicates that supply chain disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war significantly contributed to the surge in food prices in 2021-22.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the COVID-19 pandemic was a significant factor, the report also highlights other contributing factors such as climate change, natural disasters, civil unrest, and political instability. Statement 2 accurately reflects the report's prediction regarding climate change's impact on food insecurity. Statement 3 is also correct; the report directly links supply chain disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine war to increased food prices. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the multifaceted factors contributing to food insecurity as presented in the IFPRI report.  The incorrect statement about the primary cause of food insecurity acts as a key distractor.  The accurate statements about climate change and the Russia-Ukraine war's impact are important facts for UPSC aspirants to remember.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the target beneficiaries of the POSHAN Abhiyan. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the POSHAN Abhiyan aims to reduce stunting, it targets specific districts with the highest malnutrition burden, not *all* districts, and the timeframe is not limited to 2025. Statement 3 correctly points out the use of digital tools like the 'Poshan Tracker' for monitoring and identification of malnourished children. The question tests both the goals and the implementation strategies of the POSHAN Abhiyan. The distractor is the statement about the comprehensive nationwide scope and the specific timeframe for stunting reduction, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the program's targets and reach.


**8. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following statements:**

1.  A village achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) status means that every household and public/community institution uses safe sanitation technologies, and no visible faeces are found in the environment.
2. ODF Plus status requires sustaining ODF status and implementing either solid or liquid waste management systems.
3.  An ODF Plus Model village, in addition to the above, must also demonstrate visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, plastic waste), and display ODF Plus IEC messages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately define the different levels of achievement under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen).  Statement 1 correctly defines ODF status. Statement 2 correctly defines ODF Plus status. Statement 3 correctly defines ODF Plus Model village status. This question directly tests the definition of the different stages of sanitation achievement under the Swachh Bharat Mission.  There are no significant distractors as all three statements are closely related and build upon each other to define the progressive stages of the program.  However, the candidate needs to possess precise knowledge of each stage's requirements to answer correctly.

1. The NCPCR issued guidelines for the assessment of child suspects in heinous offences under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.
2.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with no exceptions for heinous offenses.
3. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015,  categorizes offences committed by juveniles into heinous offences (minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment), serious offences (three to seven years imprisonment), and petty offences (up to three years imprisonment).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the NCPCR's actions regarding guidelines for child suspects. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2015 Act does include a provision allowing for children aged 16-18 involved in heinous offenses to be tried as adults, based on an assessment by the Juvenile Justice Board. Statement 3 correctly outlines the categorization of offences under the Act.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Juvenile Justice Act and the NCPCR's role. The incorrect statement about the age definition acts as a distractor.  The other options are incorrect due to the factual inaccuracy regarding the age provision for heinous offences.  A deep understanding of the Act's provisions is necessary to answer correctly.


**10. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse, excluding emotional, verbal, and economic abuse.
2. The PWDVA allows for complaints to be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself, excluding any other person acting on her behalf.
3. The PWDVA provides for civil remedies but does not allow for criminal proceedings in cases of marital rape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PWDVA has a broader definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act allows for complaints to be filed by the aggrieved woman or by a Protection Officer or any other person on her behalf. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the PWDVA primarily provides civil remedies, it doesn't explicitly prevent criminal proceedings in cases of marital rape, although these are usually pursued under other laws. The question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the PWDVA's scope and provisions.  All three statements present incorrect information, acting as strong distractors and requiring a thorough understanding of the Act to identify all the inaccuracies.  This question emphasizes the importance of accurate recall of legal definitions and procedures.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE explicitly highlights the importance of fostering scientific inquiry skills, not just rote learning of scientific facts.  It emphasizes a hands-on, investigative approach to science education.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Environmental education is a crucial component of the NCF-SE, integrated throughout the curriculum and culminating in a dedicated subject at the secondary level. This reflects the growing awareness of environmental issues and the need for responsible citizenship.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While interdisciplinary studies are encouraged by the NCF-SE to promote holistic learning, it doesn't mandate them as a separate subject at the Primary Stage.  The framework promotes integration across subjects but doesn't specify a separate interdisciplinary subject at the primary level.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the NCF-SE's approach to school education.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for the school education system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs, released in 2021-22, used data from UDISE+ 2020-21 and NAS 2020.
2.  In the PGI 2.0 assessment, no State/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').
3.  The PGI-D report combines data from 2019-20 and 2020-21 to assess district-level performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs utilized data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021, not the previous year's data. This is a crucial detail, as the data used significantly impacts the assessment results. Statement 2 is correct.  No State or Union Territory attained the highest grade ('Daksh') in the PGI 2.0 evaluation. This finding highlights the need for further improvements in school education across the country. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report combined data from 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21. The consistent use of the most recent data is critical for accurate assessments of educational progress. Thus, only statement 2 is entirely accurate regarding the PGI assessment.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education, consider the following statements:**

1.  NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 40% in higher education by 2035.
2.  The policy proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) to promote interdisciplinary learning.
3.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) will be a digital platform to store academic credits earned from various institutions, enabling multiple exit options.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50%, not 40%, by 2035. This ambitious goal reflects the policy's focus on expanding access to higher education. Statement 2 is correct.

1.  Institutions less than 15 years old are eligible to apply for DTBU status under the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023.
2.  The UGC Regulations, 2023, allow a cluster of institutions managed by a single sponsoring body to apply for DTBU status.
3.  DTBUs are mandated to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores into digital lockers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, lowered the minimum age requirement for institutions applying for DTBU status to less than 20 years, not 15 years.  This change aims to encourage younger, high-performing institutions to seek DTBU status. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by *more than one* sponsoring body to apply for DTBU status, fostering collaboration and resource sharing. Statement 3 is correct.  The regulations mandate that DTBUs create ABC identities for their students and upload credit scores, enhancing transparency and facilitating credit transfer.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the provisions of the UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, using the National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) as its primary framework.
2. The NCrF proposes a credit system dividing education into 8 levels, with levels 1-4 representing school education and levels 4.5-8 representing higher education.
3. The NCrF aims to enhance flexibility and mobility in education by allowing for multiple entry and exit points and credit transfer across different educational pathways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCrF does integrate credits from various educational streams, it encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF), the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), and the National Curriculum Framework (NCF)/NSEQF, not solely relying on the NSEQF.  Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF’s credit system is structured across eight levels, with the first four dedicated to school education and the remaining levels to higher education. This structured approach facilitates credit accumulation and transfer. Statement 3 is correct. A key objective of the NCrF is to create a more flexible and mobile education system by enabling students to enter and exit educational pathways at various points and transfer credits earned across different programs.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the core features of the NCrF.


**6. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).
2.  The Index assesses gender equality across four parameters: Economic Participation and Opportunity; Educational Attainment; Health and Survival; and Political Empowerment.
3.  India's ranking in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was below 100.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is published annually by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP. The WEF's report provides a comprehensive assessment of gender disparities globally. Statement 2 is correct. The Index uses four key parameters to measure gender equality, encompassing economic opportunities, educational achievements, health outcomes, and political representation. These parameters provide a holistic view of gender disparities. Statement 3 is correct. India's ranking in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was indeed below 100, indicating significant room for improvement in gender equality.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate regarding the Global Gender Gap Index.


**7. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
2.  The rules explicitly allow single women (widows or divorcees) to undergo surrogacy using donor eggs and their own sperm.
3. The rules maintain the 2022 prohibition on the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendment allows surrogacy with donor gametes under specific conditions, requiring at least one gamete from the intending couple. This addresses some of the limitations of the previous rules. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the rules allow single women to undergo surrogacy, they must use their own eggs and donor sperm, not the other way around as stated.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2024 rules specifically amended the 2022 rules to allow for surrogacy with donor gametes under certain circumstances, thus overturning the previous prohibition. Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the provisions of the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024.


**8. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. PWDVA defines domestic violence to include only physical and sexual abuse, excluding emotional and economic abuse.
2.  The Act allows complaints to be filed only by the aggrieved woman herself, excluding any other person on her behalf.
3. The Act provides for civil remedies but does not offer any criminal penalties for domestic violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA has a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, emotional, economic, and verbal abuse. This comprehensive definition ensures that various forms of abuse are addressed under the Act. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows for complaints to be filed not only by the aggrieved woman but also by a Protection Officer or any other person on her behalf, if she is unable to do so herself. This provision ensures that victims receive support even if they are unable to file a complaint independently. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the PWDVA primarily focuses on civil remedies, such as protection orders and compensation, it doesn't exclude the possibility of pursuing criminal charges under other relevant laws for the same acts of domestic violence.  The Act works in conjunction with other legal frameworks to ensure comprehensive protection for victims.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the provisions of the PWDVA, 2005.


**9. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5), consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 data indicates that spousal abuse is most prevalent in Bihar, followed by Karnataka, Manipur, and Telangana.

3. NFHS-5 is a large-scale, nationally representative survey conducted by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 did show higher rates of spousal abuse in several states, the order of prevalence was different.  Karnataka showed a higher percentage of spousal abuse than Bihar according to NFHS-5. Statement 2 is incorrect. NFHS-5 actually reported that more than 29% of ever-married women in the 18-49 age group experienced spousal violence (physical and/or sexual).  This highlights a significant concern regarding violence against women. Statement 3 is correct. NFHS-5 is a large-scale, nationally representative survey conducted by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS) in collaboration with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This survey provides crucial data on various health and demographic indicators in India. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately describes NFHS-5.


**10. With reference to the  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 16 in all occupations.
2. The Act makes provisions for the prohibition of employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.
3. The Act mandates the registration of all child labourers with the local authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 years in all occupations, not 16.  The age limit for prohibition is 14, not 16. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act specifically prohibits the employment of adolescents between 14 and 18 years of age in hazardous occupations and processes. This provision aims to protect vulnerable young people from dangerous work environments. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act does not mandate the registration of all child labourers with local authorities. The focus is on prevention and rehabilitation, not on creating a registry of child workers.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a provision of the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016.


**11. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a 'child' as a person below the age of 16 years.
2. The Act allows for the transfer of juveniles aged 16-18 years to the adult justice system for heinous offences.
3. The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to handle cases involving children in conflict with the law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a 'child' as a person who has not completed 18 years of age. The Act aims to protect children up to the age of 18. Statement 2 is correct.  A key provision of the Act allows for the transfer of juveniles aged 16-18 to the adult justice system if they are accused of heinous offences.  This provision is subject to assessment by a Juvenile Justice Board. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards as specialized tribunals to handle cases involving children in conflict with the law, focusing on rehabilitation and restorative justice.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015.


**12. With reference to the  Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines manual scavenging to include only the removal of human excreta from insanitary latrines.
2. The Act mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines by local authorities to eliminate insanitary latrines.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines manual scavenging more broadly to include the removal of human excreta from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks.  The definition extends beyond just insanitary latrines. Statement 2 is correct.  A crucial aspect of the Act is the mandate for local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines, aiming to eliminate insanitary latrines and prevent the need for manual scavenging. Statement 3 is correct. The Act includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance to help them transition to dignified livelihoods.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect the key provisions of the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013.


**13. With reference to the  National Digital Education Architecture (NDEAR), consider the following statements:**

1. NDEAR is a collaborative initiative of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
2. NDEAR's main objective is to establish a nationwide network of digital libraries for educational resources.
3.  The Ministry of Education has directed states to establish Samiksha Kendras (VSKs) under NDEAR to monitor educational projects and learning outcomes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NDEAR is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Education (MoE) and the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), leveraging technological capabilities to enhance the education system. Statement 2 is incorrect.  NDEAR's aim is broader than just creating digital libraries. It focuses on creating a comprehensive digital infrastructure for education, including various aspects like learning management systems, assessment tools, and data analytics. Statement 3 is correct.  The MoE has indeed instructed states to set up VSKs under NDEAR to monitor educational programs, track student progress, and gather data for informed decision-making. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe aspects of NDEAR.


**14. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023 is jointly published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the World Food Programme (WFP).
2.  India's ranking in the GHI 2023 improved significantly compared to the 2015 index.
3.  The GHI 2023 uses four key indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 is published by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the FAO and WFP. While the FAO and WFP are major players in addressing global hunger, they are not the publishers of the GHI. Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking in the GHI 2023 showed a marginal improvement compared to 2015, but it was not a significant change. The improvement was slight, not substantial. Statement 3 is correct. The GHI uses four key indicators to assess hunger levels: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality. These indicators provide a comprehensive picture of the nutritional status of children. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the characteristics of the GHI 2023.

1. IFPRI was established in 1971 as a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2.  IFPRI's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. IFPRI primarily focuses on providing research-based policy solutions for reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in over 50 countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that IFPRI was established in 1971 is incorrect; it was actually established in 1975.  The headquarters of IFPRI are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva, Switzerland. The third statement is largely correct; IFPRI does focus on research-based policy solutions to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, and it works in over 60 countries,  making the statement about 50 countries an understatement. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.



**2. With reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1960 and is headquartered in New York City.
2.  The UNHCR operates in 120 countries, focusing primarily on providing aid to internally displaced persons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1960, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  The UNHCR works in 137 countries, not 120, and its mandate extends beyond internally displaced persons to encompass refugees and asylum seekers fleeing conflict and persecution. Finally, the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents for the UNHCR's operations.



**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI was established in 1998 and is headquartered in London, England.
2. GANHRI's membership includes over 150 National Human Rights Institutions, but not India’s NHRC.
3. GANHRI's primary function is to review and accredit National Human Rights Institutions based on the Paris Principles, adopted in 1993.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are inaccurate. GANHRI was founded in 1993, not 1998, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland.  India's NHRC is a member of GANHRI; the statement stating it is not a member is false.  However, statement 3 accurately reflects GANHRI's core function of reviewing and accrediting National Human Rights Institutions in accordance with the Paris Principles, which were indeed adopted in 1993.


**4. With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNPFII was established in 2005 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly and is headquartered in Geneva.
2. The UNPFII comprises 20 independent experts, with 10 nominated by governments and 10 by indigenous organizations.
3. The UNPFII's mandate primarily focuses on economic and social development issues related to indigenous populations, excluding environmental and cultural concerns.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) None
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The UNPFII was established in 2000, not 2005, by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly, and its headquarters are in New York. The UNPFII has 16 independent experts, not 20, with 8 nominated by governments and 8 by indigenous organizations.  Finally, the UNPFII's mandate encompasses a broad range of issues, including economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights related to indigenous peoples.


**5. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF includes only global indicators for SDGs, excluding any indicators specific to India’s needs.
2. The NIF, as of 2023, contains fewer than 200 indicators.
3. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and circulating guidelines for State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The NIF incorporates both global and India-specific indicators tailored to the country's unique requirements. The NIF in 2023 has 284 indicators, significantly more than 200. Statement 3 correctly identifies MoSPI's role in developing and disseminating guidelines for SIFs across states and union territories.


**6. With reference to the Bihar Caste Census, consider the following statements:**

1. The caste census in Bihar is a Union subject under the Census Act of 1948.
2. The Bihar government’s caste survey was a full-scale population census including caste demographics.
3. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) of 2011 included and published caste data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  While census is a Union subject, the Bihar caste survey was not a full-scale census conducted under the Census Act of 1948, but rather a state-level initiative. The Bihar government clarified it was not a full-scale population census, but a social survey focused on caste demographics.  Furthermore, the SECC 2011 data, excluding caste data, was finalized and published; the caste data from SECC 2011 was not published.


**7. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI assesses the performance of school education systems at the state level only.
2. The PGI 2.0 for 2021-22 classified states/UTs into five grades, with Punjab achieving the highest grade.
3. The PGI-D report focuses on school infrastructure and teacher qualifications exclusively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The PGI assesses school education at both the state and district levels (PGI-D).  In PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, states/UTs were classified into ten grades, not five, and Punjab did not achieve the highest grade; no state/UT attained the highest grade.  The PGI-D considers various aspects, including outcomes, effective classroom transactions, and school safety, but its scope goes beyond infrastructure and teacher qualifications.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education, consider the following statements:**

1. The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 75% by 2035.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect.  The new regulations allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply, not 10.  Additionally, the regulations permit clusters of institutions managed by *more than one* sponsoring body to apply, not a single one.  Statement 3 is correct; institutions granted DtbU status must create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores.


**10. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FHEIs must be ranked among the top 1000 globally to establish campuses in India under the UGC Regulations, 2023.

Online or distance learning programs are prohibited for FHEIs under these regulations.  Statement 3 is accurate; FHEIs require central government approval before accepting foreign donations.


**11. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education into eight levels.
2. The NCrF does not account for experiential learning or credits earned through industry experience.

(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; the relationship is that all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not vice-versa.  Statements 1 and 3 are correct. DNTs were indeed labelled as "criminal tribes," and the NCDNT's mandate includes creating a state-wise list of DNT castes.


**14. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.

3.  The MTP Act, 1971, does not provide any provision for the abortion of a surrogate child.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Abortion is not legal under all circumstances in India; it is regulated by the MTP Act. The amended MTP Act allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women and under specific conditions up to 24 weeks.  The Surrogacy Act 2021 requires written consent from the surrogate mother and authorization from the appropriate authority for the abortion of a surrogate child, contradicting statement 3.

(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The report indicates that a large portion of India's population falls within the working-age group, not a significantly smaller one. Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect findings from the report: India's population did surpass China's in mid-2023, and eight countries, including India, are expected to contribute significantly to global population growth by 2050.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest absolute number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has a significant ST population, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs.  The question plays on the difference between the overall ST population and the specific PVTG categorization.

Statement 2 is correct. These are the established criteria used by the Government of India to identify and classify PVTGs.  The statement directly reflects the defining characteristics of PVTGs.

Statement 3 is correct.  Odisha has thirteen PVTGs, the highest number among all Indian states. This is a specific fact that requires factual recall.


**2. With reference to the De-Notified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the criteria used by the Government of India to identify PVTGs.  These groups are characterized by their traditional lifestyles, limited access to education and resources, and often face demographic challenges.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while Odisha does have a significant number of PVTGs (13), Madhya Pradesh also has a considerable number, making Odisha's count not definitively the highest.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Bharia, Kamar, and Baiga tribes are listed as PVTGs in *both* Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating their presence across multiple states.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect;  the relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is that *all* DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic, but not all nomadic tribes are designated as DNTs.  Statement 2 correctly states that the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. This act was a significant step in removing the discriminatory labeling of certain communities. Statement 3 is incorrect regarding the precise figures. While the Renke Commission did address the nomadic and semi-nomadic populations and DNTs, the provided numbers are not entirely accurate according to the commission's findings.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least a 5% reservation for persons with disabilities in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, including police forces.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those caused by acid attacks.

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the RPwD Act does mandate reservations for persons with disabilities in higher education and government jobs, this reservation is explicitly *not* applicable to police forces (including Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, and Delhi/UT police). Statement 2 is correct; the Act significantly broadens the definition of disability to include a wide range of conditions. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the Act emphasizes faster adjudication of cases, it doesn't mandate a dedicated special court in *every* district solely for cases under the Act. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) includes a provision for imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine of up to Rs. Two Lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, regardless of their employment status.
3.  The National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to completely eliminate manual scavenging and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the penalty; the PEMSR Act prescribes imprisonment up to *two* years and a fine up to Rs. *One* Lakh, not the amounts stated. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Act defines manual scavengers as those handling *undecomposed* human waste,  and the definition includes both regular and contractual employees. Statement 3 accurately describes the goal of the National Policy for mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem, aiming for complete mechanization of sanitation to eliminate manual scavenging.  Therefore, only statement 3 is fully correct.

3.  The SEED (Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities) initiative is implemented solely by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The NCDNT's mandate includes preparing a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs, although the focus is on comprehensive data collection and welfare measures, not solely a caste-based list. Statement 2 is correct; the Dr. Ambedkar scholarship specifically targets DNT members not covered under other reservation categories. Statement 3 is incorrect; the SEED scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Social Justice & Empowerment, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 are essentially correct, although statement 1 needs a nuanced understanding.

Statement 3 is correct; the framework aims to enhance flexibility and mobility in education.  Only statement 3 is accurate.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The term PVTGs was first used in 1973 based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission.
2.  Odisha has the highest number of PVTGs, exceeding 15.
3.  The Bharia PVTG is exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PVTGs were initially recognized as PTGs (Primitive Tribal Groups) in 1973 based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961), and the nomenclature was changed to PVTGs in 2006.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs (13), not exceeding 15.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The Bharia tribe is listed as a PVTG in both Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, indicating it's not exclusively found in Madhya Pradesh.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of nuanced details regarding PVTG categorization and distribution.  A superficial understanding of the topic might lead to incorrect conclusions.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which led to the denotification of certain tribes, was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission, in 2008, estimated the total population of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs to be less than 10 crore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is that all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not vice versa. Many nomadic groups were not labeled criminal and hence not DNTs. Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Renke Commission (2008) estimated the combined population of nomadic, semi-nomadic tribes, and DNTs to be nearly 15 crore (150 million), a significantly higher figure. The question tests factual knowledge about the history and categorization of DNTs, requiring precise recall of legislation and commission reports. The incorrect options introduce plausible but ultimately false information, making the question challenging.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5 years, for employing individuals as manual scavengers. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act explicitly tasks local authorities with the construction and maintenance of functional community sanitary latrines. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, encompassing those employed to handle human waste from various sources, including insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, and railway tracks; it also includes Safal karamcharis. The question tests detailed understanding of the Act's provisions regarding penalties, responsibilities of local authorities, and the definition of manual scavengers.  The incorrect options contain plausible but inaccurate details, enhancing the challenge.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF aims to create a unified framework for credit accumulation and transfer across diverse educational pathways. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF uses an 8-level framework, not 7, for credit integration. Statement 3 is correct. The NCrF introduces the concept of "notional learning hours" to provide a standard measure for credit allocation. The question assesses understanding of the structure and key concepts of the NCrF, testing knowledge of the number of levels and the introduction of a new concept.  The partially correct statement about the number of levels adds to the difficulty.

NFHS-5 provides comprehensive data on various maternal and child health indicators, including immunization coverage.  The question tests general knowledge of the NFHS-5 report and its key findings, requiring an understanding of the survey's timeline and the types of data it provides. All statements are factually accurate, making it a straightforward but knowledge-based question.


**12. With reference to the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), consider the following statements:**

1.  ODF Plus status requires the sustained achievement of ODF status along with the implementation of solid waste management systems only.
2. An ODF Plus Model village must demonstrate visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater.
3.  The Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) aims to achieve 100% ODF Plus status for all Indian villages by 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ODF Plus status requires the sustained achievement of ODF status along with the implementation of either solid or liquid waste management systems, not exclusively solid waste management. Statement 2 is correct. An ODF Plus Model village is indeed required to maintain visual cleanliness, as described in the statement. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the mission aims for high ODF Plus coverage, a specific target year of 2024 for 100% coverage is not explicitly stated in the provided information.  The question tests the understanding of the criteria for ODF Plus and ODF Plus Model village status under the Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen), requiring precise knowledge of the waste management components and the absence of a definitive completion year.  The partially correct statements increase the difficulty.



**1. With reference to the Swachhta Udyami Yojana and NAMASTE scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for purchasing sanitation equipment.
2.  NAMASTE scheme is solely managed by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment.
3.  NAMASTE promotes 100% mechanization of sewer cleaning, septic tank cleaning, and solid waste disposal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana indeed offers concessional loans to facilitate the procurement of sanitation-related equipment.  This initiative aims to empower individuals to establish businesses in the sanitation sector, thereby contributing to improved sanitation infrastructure and services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NAMASTE (National Action for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem) scheme is a joint initiative of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA).  It's a collaborative effort highlighting the shared responsibility in addressing sanitation challenges.

Statement 3 is partially correct. NAMASTE strongly promotes 100% mechanization for tasks like sewer and septic tank cleaning, drain desilting, and garbage lifting. However, the description is not fully comprehensive, as it also includes sludge handling and medical waste disposal.  The statement's oversimplification makes it partially inaccurate.



**2. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1.  NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3.  NCF-SE introduces a semester system for studying, replacing the annual exam system.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, aiming to align the educational system with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020. This restructuring aims to improve learning outcomes and create a more holistic and flexible educational approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NCF-SE emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages, it doesn't mandate proficiency in three languages where one must be a foreign language.  The framework encourages proficiency in at least three languages, but at least two of these must be Indian languages, promoting the preservation and development of India's linguistic diversity.

Statement 3 is correct.  NCF-SE proposes a shift towards a semester system, aiming to enhance the learning process and provide more frequent assessments.  This aligns with the broader goal of making the educational system more flexible and adaptable to the diverse needs of learners.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While grants and loans from the central government and donations form a significant part of the Anusandhan NRF's funding, the statement omits other sources mentioned, such as income from investments and funds from the Science and Engineering Research Fund (established under the 2008 Act). This omission makes the statement incomplete and thus, technically inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Prime Minister of India holds the ex-officio position of President on the Governing Board of the Anusandhan NRF. This highlights the government's commitment to providing strategic direction for research and development initiatives within the country.

Statement 3 is correct. The Department of Science and Technology (DST) serves as the administrative department for the Anusandhan NRF. This underscores the crucial role of the DST in overseeing the Foundation's operations and ensuring its effective functioning.

3. India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was below 100.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Index is released annually by the World Economic Forum, not the United Nations Development Programme.  This is a crucial distinction that highlights the different organizations involved in tracking gender equality globally.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gender Social Norms Index focuses on understanding the systemic barriers and discrimination faced by women worldwide, examining various aspects of their lives.  This index provides a valuable perspective on the challenges women face in different societies.

Statement 3 is correct.  India's rank in the 2023 Global Gender Gap Index was 127 out of 146 countries, which is significantly below 100. This indicates that India still faces considerable challenges in achieving gender equality.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates a minimum of 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs and government-aided higher educational institutions. This provision aims to promote inclusivity and equal opportunities for individuals with disabilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act recognizes a comprehensive list of 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those resulting from acid attacks. This broad definition aims to ensure that a wide range of individuals with disabilities are covered under the protective provisions of the Act.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act specifically excludes police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT Police) from the reservation policy for persons with disabilities. This is a specific exception within the broader framework of the Act.


**6. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. PEMSR defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, even if using protective gear.
2. PEMSR makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines and employ individuals to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
3. PEMSR outlines procedures for rehabilitating manual scavengers through alternative employment, financial assistance, and property acquisition support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. PEMSR defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle *undecomposed* human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits. The use of protective gear does not negate the categorization as a manual scavenger under the act; the act aims to eliminate the practice altogether.

Statement 2 is correct. The act explicitly prohibits the construction of insanitary latrines and the employment of individuals for cleaning sewers and septic tanks without proper protective equipment. This emphasis on safety and prevention is a key feature of the legislation.

Statement 3 is correct. PEMSR includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, offering support in finding alternative employment, providing financial assistance, and aiding in acquiring property. This aspect of the act aims to ensure a dignified and sustainable transition for those affected by manual scavenging.


**7. With reference to the National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 is conducted every five years.
2. NFHS-5 collects data on various health indicators including maternal and child health, nutrition, and family planning.
3. NFHS-5 data is collected through a nationally representative sample survey, not a census.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the NFHS surveys are conducted periodically, they are not conducted at precise five-year intervals; the timing is adjusted to meet the needs of data collection and analysis.  This makes a statement about the exact frequency of the survey inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. NFHS-5 collects data on a wide range of health indicators, encompassing maternal and child health, nutrition levels, family planning practices, and other related aspects of health and well-being.  This comprehensive data collection is crucial for informed policymaking.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NFHS data is collected through a nationally representative sample survey, not a complete census of the entire population.  This approach allows for efficient data collection while ensuring the sample is representative of the broader population.  A census would be considerably more resource-intensive.


**8. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is primarily managed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and are eligible for performance-linked incentives.
3. The Anganwadi system's primary objective is to provide early childhood care and education to children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system falls under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. While health aspects are integrated, the overall management and coordination reside with the MoWCD.

Statement 2 is correct. AWWs receive a fixed monthly honorarium determined by the government, and they are also eligible for performance-linked incentives based on their work and contribution to the Anganwadi services.  This incentive structure aims to improve service delivery.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  While early childhood care and development are core components, the Anganwadi system's objective extends beyond children aged 0-6 years. It also focuses on improving the nutritional and health status of pregnant women and lactating mothers. The statement's limited scope makes it partially incorrect.


**9. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI is released annually by the World Food Programme (WFP).
2. The GHI uses four indicators to assess the severity of hunger: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score in 2023 indicated a "serious" level of hunger.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, not the World Food Programme (WFP).  These are two distinct organizations with different mandates.  This is a critical distinction for understanding the GHI's origins and methodology.

Statement 2 is correct. The GHI indeed uses four key indicators – undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality – to assess the severity of hunger in different countries.  These indicators provide a multi-faceted perspective on the issue of hunger.

Statement 3 is correct. India's GHI score in 2023 placed it in the "serious" category on the hunger severity scale. This highlights the ongoing challenges related to hunger and malnutrition within the country.


**10. With reference to Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented solid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus Model village must demonstrate visual cleanliness, including minimal litter and stagnant wastewater.
3.  The achievement of ODF Plus status is monitored solely by the Ministry of Rural Development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid *or* liquid waste management systems; the statement incorrectly implies both are mandatory.  This subtle difference makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. ODF Plus Model villages are expected to maintain visual cleanliness, minimizing litter, stagnant wastewater, and plastic waste in public areas.  This broader definition of cleanliness goes beyond the basic sanitation aspects of ODF status.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Rural Development plays a significant role, the monitoring of ODF Plus status involves multiple agencies and stakeholders at various levels of government, including both central and state-level entities.  The statement's oversimplification makes it incorrect.


**1. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), consider the following statements:**

1. IFPRI was established in 1971 as a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2. IFPRI's headquarters are located in Rome, Italy, and it operates in over 60 countries.
3.  A key focus of IFPRI's research is providing policy solutions to reduce poverty, hunger, and malnutrition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IFPRI is indeed a major research center of CGIAR, it was established in 1975, not 1971. CGIAR was established in 1971. Statement 2 is incorrect. IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., USA, not Rome, Italy.  Statement 3 is correct.  A core mandate of IFPRI is to conduct research and offer policy recommendations aimed at mitigating poverty, hunger, and malnutrition globally.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects information about IFPRI.


**2. With reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1955 and is headquartered in New York City.
2.  In 2022, the UNHCR reported that forced displacement worldwide was 21% lower than in 2021, primarily due to decreased conflict.
3. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are foundational legal documents guiding UNHCR operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1955, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City. Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNHCR's 2022 report indicated a 21% *increase*, not decrease, in forced displacement compared to 2021. This increase was attributed to several factors, including ongoing conflicts and crises. Statement 3 is correct.  The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed the cornerstone legal frameworks underpinning the UNHCR's mandate and activities.  Thus, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI, established in 1998, is headquartered in Washington D.C. and accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Helsinki Principles.
2.  The GANHRI's deferral of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) accreditation was primarily due to concerns about insufficient funding for NHRC operations.
3.  The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993, provide standards for NHRIs worldwide, and GANHRI's accreditation process incorporates these principles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1998, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington D.C.  Furthermore, GANHRI uses the Paris Principles, not the Helsinki Principles, for accreditation. Statement 2 is incorrect. The GANHRI's deferral of NHRC accreditation stemmed from concerns regarding political interference in appointments, the involvement of police in human rights violation investigations, and a lack of cooperation with civil society organizations.  Statement 3 is correct. The Paris Principles, adopted in 1993 by the UN General Assembly, serve as the global benchmark for NHRIs, and GANHRI's accreditation process directly incorporates these standards.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNPFII was established in 2005 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly and is headquartered in Geneva.
2. The UNPFII's membership comprises 16 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations.
3.  The UNPFII's mandate includes addressing indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, environment, education, health, and human rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the UNPFII's mandate does focus on indigenous issues, it was established in 2000, not 2005, by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN General Assembly. Its headquarters are in New York, not Geneva. Statement 2 is correct. The UNPFII's membership consists of 16 independent experts, with eight nominated by governments and eight by indigenous organizations. Statement 3 is correct. The UNPFII's mandate explicitly encompasses indigenous issues across a broad range of areas, including economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**5. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF, developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), comprises indicators aligned solely with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
2.  The 2023 NIF Progress Report indicated that India has fully achieved all Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets.
3. The MoSPI has developed guidelines for States/UTs to create their own State Indicator Frameworks (SIFs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NIF aligns with the GIF, it also includes indicators tailored to India's specific context and needs, going beyond the GIF's scope. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2023 NIF Progress Report highlighted that progress on many SDG targets in India is still weak or stalled, indicating that India has not fully achieved all SDG targets. Statement 3 is correct. The MoSPI has indeed circulated guidelines to States/UTs to facilitate the development of their own SIFs, allowing for localized monitoring and implementation of the SDGs.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**6. With reference to the  Caste Census in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Census of India, conducted decennially, includes a comprehensive caste-based enumeration of the entire population, except for Scheduled Castes (SCs) and Scheduled Tribes (STs).
2. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC) 2011, while collecting caste data, did not publish this data due to concerns about its accuracy.
3.  The responsibility for conducting the decennial census rests with the Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, under the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  After independence, India abandoned full caste enumeration except for SCs and STs.  The decennial census does not include a comprehensive caste-based enumeration for the general population. Statement 2 is partially correct. The SECC 2011 did collect caste data, but only the data excluding caste information was published, not the caste data itself.  The reasons were multifaceted and included concerns about accuracy and potential misuse. Statement 3 is correct. The Registrar General and Census Commissioner of India, under the Ministry of Home Affairs, is indeed responsible for conducting the decennial census.  Therefore, only statement 3 is fully accurate.


**7. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, mandates the construction of insanitary latrines to facilitate the safe removal of human excreta.

3.  The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through measures like training in alternative employment and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act aims to *prevent* manual scavenging, and a key component is the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines into sanitary ones, not their construction.  The act makes the construction of insanitary latrines an offense. Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of manual scavengers in the Act is broader and includes those employed to handle human waste from various sources, even if with protective gear in some cases. The exception mentioned refers to those using protective gear. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act does indeed outline provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers, including training in alternate employment, financial aid, and assistance in property acquisition.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy, with strict regulations on commercial practices.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to oversee the implementation of the Act.
3. The Act allows foreign nationals to utilize surrogacy services in India under specific conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act explicitly *prohibits* commercial surrogacy and only allows altruistic surrogacy, where no monetary compensation is involved beyond basic medical expenses and insurance. Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the NARTSB to monitor and regulate surrogacy practices in India. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act bans surrogacy for foreign nationals.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**9. With reference to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The PWDVA, 2005, defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse inflicted by an adult male member of the family.
2.  The Act provides for civil remedies but does not address criminal aspects of domestic violence.
3. The Act allows for the filing of complaints by the aggrieved woman, a Protection Officer, or another designated person on her behalf.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA defines domestic violence more broadly, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse, and it is not limited to acts committed by adult males.  The Supreme Court has struck down the limitation to adult males. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act primarily provides civil remedies, it also allows for linkages with existing criminal laws to address the criminal aspects of domestic violence. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act does indeed allow for complaints to be filed by the aggrieved woman herself, a Protection Officer, or another authorized person acting on her behalf. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**10. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in all workplaces, regardless of the number of employees.
2.  The Act defines sexual harassment to include only physical contact and advances.
3.  The Act provides for an appeals process if either the aggrieved woman or the respondent is dissatisfied with the ICC's decision.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates ICCs only in organizations with 10 or more employees.  Smaller organizations fall under the purview of Local Committees. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act's definition of sexual harassment is much broader, encompassing physical contact and advances, demands for sexual favors, sexually colored remarks, showing pornography, and other unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act does include a provision for appeals to a court if either party is not satisfied with the ICC's decision. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE emphasizes rote learning and memorization of facts as the primary method of teaching science.
2. The NCF-SE integrates environmental education across all stages of schooling, culminating in a dedicated subject at the secondary level.
3. The NCF-SE advocates for a purely subject-based approach to education, minimizing interdisciplinary connections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 targets a GER of at least 50%, not 75%, by 2035. Statement 2 is correct.  The NEP 2020 does indeed advocate for multiple exit options at different stages of undergraduate programs, providing flexibility for students. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 actively encourages the establishment of MERUs to foster interdisciplinary research and education. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The RPwD Act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those resulting from acid attacks.  This is a straightforward test of factual recall.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act does provide for the establishment of special courts in each district to handle cases more efficiently.  This statement tests knowledge of the Act's judicial provisions.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Manual Scavenging:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR) allows the employment of individuals to clean human waste if appropriate protective gear is used.
2.  The PEMSR Act makes it an offence to construct insanitary latrines, but not to employ individuals to clean sewers without protective gear.
3.  The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) provides financial aid but not assistance with property purchase for rehabilitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. NFHS surveys are conducted periodically to collect comprehensive data on health indicators.  However, the precise periodicity might vary slightly and is not explicitly stated in the provided text. The question uses a minor imprecision to test for thorough knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The NFHS uses a nationally representative sample, making its findings generalizable to the Indian population. This is a straightforward test of the survey's methodology.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare plays a crucial role, the NFHS is a collaborative effort involving various organizations and institutions. The question employs an oversimplification to test for a nuanced understanding of the report's production.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1.  Anganwadi workers (AWWs) and helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed honorarium but are not eligible for any performance-linked incentives.
2.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's ranking is high and its GHI score indicates a serious hunger situation, the exact categorization on the severity scale might be "serious" rather than "alarming". The question uses a slightly different word to test for accurate recall of the classification.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI methodology does include undernourishment, child stunting, wasting, and mortality as key indicators. This is a straightforward test of factual knowledge regarding the index's components.


**10. With reference to the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and its reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNFPA is a specialized agency of the United Nations, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.
2.  The UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023 projects that India will surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2023.
3.  The report highlights India's relatively young population, with a significant proportion falling within the working-age group (15-64 years).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNFPA is a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly, not a specialized agency, and its headquarters are in New York City, not Geneva.  The question uses incorrect information about the organization's status and location to create a distractor, testing for precise knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UNFPA report does project India surpassing China in population. This is a straightforward test of factual recall from the report.

Statement 3 is correct. The report does indeed highlight India's young population and the significant proportion in the working-age group. This is another test of factual recall from the report.



**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE, released by the Ministry of Education, proposes a 5+3+3+4 design for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage structure.
2.  NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3.  The NCF-SE introduces a binary accreditation system for schools, classifying them as either "Accredited" or "Not Accredited," with no intermediate grades.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a revised schooling structure of 5+3+3+4, aligning with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.  This replaces the older four-stage system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCF-SE strongly emphasizes multilingualism and the importance of Indian languages, it doesn't mandate proficiency in three languages with a foreign language being compulsory. The framework promotes proficiency in at least three languages, with at least two being Indian languages.  The choice of languages is influenced by regional contexts.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCF-SE does not directly address school accreditation in a binary system.  While the text mentions a binary system for Higher Educational Institutions, this is distinct from the school accreditation framework, which is not detailed in the provided text. The text mentions a separate School Quality Assessment and Accreditation Framework to be developed by SCERTs, indicating a more nuanced approach than a simple binary classification.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs, released by the Ministry of Education, uses data from UDISE+ 2020-21 and NAS 2020.
2. In the 2021-22 PGI 2.0 assessment, all States/UTs achieved at least the "Prachesta-1" grade.
3. The PGI-D report assesses school education performance at the district level, focusing solely on infrastructure and resource allocation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 uses data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021, not 2020-21 and 2020.  The timeframe is crucial for the accuracy of the data used in the assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that none of the States/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh") in PGI 2.0 for 2021-22, and the top grade achieved was "Prachesta-2" by only two States/UTs.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report considers a broader range of factors than just infrastructure and resource allocation.  The text mentions that it focuses on "outcomes, effective classroom transaction, school safety," indicating a multi-faceted assessment.  The focus is not limited to resource distribution.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational training, but excludes experiential learning.
2.  The NCrF establishes a uniform credit system across all educational levels, with each credit representing precisely 30 learning hours.
3. The NCrF aims to facilitate lifelong learning by allowing students to accumulate credits across various educational pathways and institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly includes experiential learning as a means of earning credits, along with academic and vocational education. This is explicitly stated in the text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCrF establishes a unified credit system, it doesn't specify a fixed number of learning hours per credit. The text mentions a concept of "Notional Learning Hours," but doesn't define a universal 30-hour equivalent for each credit.  The total notional learning hours per year are specified, but not the hours per credit.

Statement 3 is correct.  The core purpose of the NCrF is to enable lifelong learning by allowing for credit accumulation and transfer across different educational settings and pathways.  This is the central goal of the framework as described in the text. The multiple entry and exit options are a key component of this goal.


**4. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, mandate that all DtBUs must be at least 20 years old.
2.  The new regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by multiple sponsoring bodies to apply for DtBU status.
3.  DtBUs are required to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 regulations have actually relaxed the age requirement for applying for DtBU status.  Previously, institutions had to be at least 20 years old, but the new regulations allow institutions younger than 20 years to apply.

Statement 2 is correct. The new regulations explicitly permit clusters of institutions under different sponsoring bodies to seek DtBU status.  This is a significant change from the previous regulations.

Statement 3 is correct.  The regulations mandate that DtBUs create ABC identities for their students and upload their credit scores to digital lockers. This ensures the portability of academic credits.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI 2023, released by Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, ranks India among the countries with the lowest hunger levels globally.
2.  The GHI uses four indicators: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.
3.  India's GHI score in 2023 shows a significant improvement compared to its score in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 actually ranks India relatively low, categorizing it as having a "serious" level of hunger.  The text indicates that India's ranking is far from the lowest hunger levels.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GHI does indeed utilize the four indicators mentioned: undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality rate. These are the key metrics used in the index's calculation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's GHI score improved slightly from 2015 to 2023, the text describes this improvement as "slight," not significant. The improvement is marginal, not substantial enough to be characterized as significant.


**6. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1. The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in all government and private sector jobs.
2.  The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and those caused by acid attacks.
3.  The Act does not provide for any special courts for faster adjudication of cases related to its violations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RPwD Act mandates reservation for persons with benchmark disabilities in government jobs (4%) and government-aided higher educational institutions (5%), but it does *not* extend this reservation to all private sector jobs.  The scope of the reservation is limited to the public sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, encompassing intellectual disabilities and those resulting from acid attacks.  This is a key feature of the Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RPwD Act *does* provide for the establishment of special courts in every district to expedite the adjudication of cases under the Act.  This is mentioned in the text as a key feature aimed at ensuring swift justice.


**7. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers solely as individuals employed to clean insanitary latrines.
2. The Act makes it an offense to construct new insanitary latrines, but not to maintain existing ones.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment options and financial assistance, but not property assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those employed to clean insanitary latrines. It includes individuals handling human waste from various sources, including sewers and septic tanks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly makes it an offense to both construct *and* maintain insanitary latrines, aiming to completely eradicate this practice.  The text indicates that the law makes it an offense to not demolish or convert insanitary latrines.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act provides for rehabilitation through alternative employment, financial aid, *and* assistance with property acquisition.  The text mentions that the act lays down rules for rehabilitation including help with purchasing property.


**8. With reference to the  Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is primarily funded by state governments, with minimal central government support.
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government and additional performance-based incentives from state governments.
3. The Saksham Anganwadi initiative focuses solely on improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Anganwadi Services Scheme is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme, indicating significant funding from the central government in addition to state government contributions.  The scheme is under the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Statement 2 is partially correct. AWWs receive a fixed monthly honorarium from the central government.  However, the additional performance-based incentives are not solely from state governments; the text mentions a performance-linked incentive from the center as well.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While improving the nutritional status of children is a core objective, Saksham Anganwadi also extends its focus to adolescent girls and early childhood care and education, encompassing a broader range of developmental needs.


**9. With reference to the  Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs in India comprises indicators that are exclusively aligned with the global SDG indicators.
2. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) is responsible for developing and disseminating the NIF.
3. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) is a static framework with a fixed number of indicators that cannot be changed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NIF includes both global indicators and those specifically tailored to India's context, showing that the framework is not solely based on global indicators.  The text mentions that NIF includes indicators tailored to India's specific requirements.

Statement 2 is correct.  MoSPI is indeed responsible for developing and releasing the NIF progress reports. This is explicitly stated in the provided text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GIF is described as "evolving in nature," implying that the number and type of indicators can be adjusted over time to reflect changing priorities and data availability. The text mentions that the NIF is similar to the GIF and that it is evolving in nature.  The GIF is not static.


**10. With reference to the  United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and its reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023 predicts that India will remain the world's second most populous country by 2050.
2.  The UNFPA, in collaboration with IIPS, released the India Ageing Report 2023.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNFPA report indicates that India surpassed China as the most populous country in mid-2023.  The statement misrepresents the report's key finding.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNFPA did indeed release the India Ageing Report 2023 in collaboration with the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS).  This is directly mentioned in the text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNFPA's mandate explicitly includes addressing gender-based violence and harmful practices as one of its key targets.  This is described in the text as one of the three zeros that UNFPA aims to achieve by 2030.


**1. With reference to Surrogacy in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, allows surrogacy using donor gametes only if the child has at least one gamete from the intending couple.
2.  Traditional surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is the biological mother, is explicitly permitted under the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021.
3. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, established the National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to regulate and monitor altruistic surrogacy practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2024 amendment to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules allows for donor gametes under specific medical conditions, ensuring at least one gamete originates from the intending couple. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy and primarily focuses on regulating altruistic gestational surrogacy, where the surrogate mother is not genetically related to the child.  Statement 3 is correct. The NARTSB was established under the 2021 Act to oversee the implementation of altruistic surrogacy regulations and monitor ART clinics.  The Act aims to prevent exploitation and ensure ethical practices in assisted reproductive technologies, including surrogacy.


**2. With reference to the Abortion Law in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, permits abortion up to 24 weeks for all women based on the advice of two registered medical practitioners.
2.  Sections 88 to 92 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, deal exclusively with the issue of abortion and criminalize the act under all circumstances except those permitted under the MTP Act, 1971.
3. The Supreme Court's ruling in Arun Muthuvel vs. Union of India allowed surrogacy for women with Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, indirectly impacting abortion laws.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act allows abortion up to 20 weeks for all women based on the advice of one doctor and extends this limit to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, requiring the advice of two medical practitioners. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, contains provisions related to causing miscarriage, it doesn't exclusively focus on abortion. The MTP Act remains the primary legal framework governing abortion in India.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Arun Muthuvel case pertains to surrogacy, not abortion, though it highlights the complexities of reproductive rights in India.  The case doesn't directly alter the existing abortion laws.


**3. With reference to Child Labour in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below the age of 16 in all occupations.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2016 amendment prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and restricts adolescents (14-18 years) from working in hazardous occupations. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCLP scheme aims to rehabilitate child labourers, its focus is broader than just vocational training. It encompasses education, skill development, and overall well-being. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PENCiL portal is managed by the Ministry of Labour and Employment, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


**4. With reference to Child Adoption in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, governs all adoptions in India, regardless of the religious background of the adoptive or biological parents.

3. The Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) is a non-statutory body responsible for overseeing both inter-country and intra-country adoptions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, applies only to Hindus and those who follow related religions.  The adoption of children from other religious backgrounds is governed by different laws and regulations. Statement 2 is correct. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, and its associated regulations provide a comprehensive framework for the adoption of children in the specified categories.  Statement 3 is incorrect. CARA is a statutory body established under the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, to regulate and monitor adoptions.


**5. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a child as a person below the age of 18 years, with no exceptions for heinous crimes.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a child as a person below 18, but the 2015 Act included a provision to try 16-18-year-olds as adults for heinous crimes; this provision was amended in 2021. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2021 amendment did not entirely remove the provision; it made changes to the process of determining whether a child aged 16-18 should be tried as an adult. Statement 3 is correct. The Act necessitates Juvenile Justice Boards in every district to handle cases related to children in conflict with the law.


**6. With reference to Sexual Harassment at Workplace in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vishaka Guidelines, formulated by the Supreme Court, are the primary legal framework for addressing sexual harassment at the workplace.

**8. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GHI is a multidimensional indicator that measures and ranks countries' hunger levels based on undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality.
2.  A higher GHI score indicates a lower level of hunger and better nutritional status within a country.
3. The GHI is published annually by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GHI is indeed a composite index that combines several indicators related to hunger and malnutrition to provide a comprehensive assessment of a country's nutritional status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A higher GHI score actually indicates a *higher* level of hunger and poorer nutritional outcomes.  A lower score signifies better nutritional status and reduced hunger.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The GHI is published annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the UNDP.  The UNDP publishes other related indices focusing on human development and poverty.


**9. With reference to the  Open Defecation Free (ODF) Plus status in India, consider the following statements:**

1. An ODF Plus village is one that has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems.
2.  The ODF Plus model village criteria include visual cleanliness, minimal litter, and the absence of plastic waste dumps in public areas.
3.  Achieving ODF Plus status requires mandatory participation in government-sponsored awareness campaigns on sanitation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only

Statement 2 is correct. Visual cleanliness and the absence of litter and plastic waste are essential components of the ODF Plus model village criteria, reflecting a broader commitment to environmental hygiene.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While participation in awareness campaigns is encouraged, it's not a mandatory requirement for achieving ODF Plus status. The focus is primarily on the implementation of sanitation infrastructure and practices.


**10. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5) report, consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 data indicates that spousal abuse is more prevalent in Southern states of India compared to Northern states.
2. NFHS-5 data shows a significant percentage of ever-married women in India have experienced spousal violence (physical and/or sexual).
3. NFHS-5 data includes information on the prevalence of dowry-related violence against women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 does provide data on spousal violence, it does not definitively support the claim that Southern states have higher rates than Northern states.  The prevalence varies across different states, and generalizations should be avoided without specific data comparisons.

Statement 2 is correct. NFHS-5 provides data indicating a significant percentage of ever-married women in India have experienced spousal violence, highlighting the prevalence of domestic violence.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 collects data on various forms of violence against women, it doesn't explicitly categorize or quantify dowry-related violence as a separate category.  Dowry-related issues are often intertwined with other forms of domestic violence.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):**

1.  The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in all organizations with more than 50 employees.
2.  The ICC's jurisdiction extends to complaints filed by clients or customers of the organization.
3.  A monetary settlement can be reached between the aggrieved woman and the respondent through conciliation under the POSH Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act mandates the establishment of an Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) in every workplace with 10 or more employees, not 50.  This is a crucial detail often missed, highlighting the wide applicability of the Act.  The threshold of 10 employees ensures a broad reach across various organizations, both large and small.

Statement 2 is correct.  The definition of "workplace" under the POSH Act is quite expansive. It includes any place visited by an employee during the course of employment, and this explicitly includes clients and customers who interact with the organization's employees. This broad definition is designed to protect women from harassment in a wide range of contexts related to their work.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The POSH Act explicitly prohibits any monetary settlement as a basis for conciliation. This is a key aspect of the Act designed to prevent the trivialization or silencing of sexual harassment complaints through financial inducements.  The focus is on justice and redressal, not financial compromise.  The emphasis is on ensuring accountability and preventing similar incidents in the future.


**2. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a "child" as a person below the age of 16 years.
2.  The Act allows for the trial of a child aged 16-18 years as an adult only in cases involving offenses punishable with death penalty.
3. Appeals against orders made by a Child Welfare Committee are permitted under the Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, defines a "child" as a person who has not completed 18 years of age.  This is a significant legal definition, impacting the application of the Act and the legal protections afforded to young people. The amendment of 2021 introduced a provision to try a child aged between 16-18 as an adult for heinous crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows for the trial of a child aged 16-18 as an adult in cases involving heinous offences, not solely those punishable by death.  The definition of "heinous offences" itself is subject to interpretation and legal debate, adding to the complexity of the provisions.  The 2021 amendments considerably broadened the scope of cases where a juvenile could be tried as an adult.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Initially, the 2015 Act did not provide for appeals against orders made by a Child Welfare Committee. However, subsequent amendments have introduced provisions for appeals, highlighting the evolution of legal frameworks addressing juvenile justice.  The possibility of an appeal underscores the need for a robust and fair system.



**3. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act permits commercial surrogacy.
2.  The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).
3.  Under the Act, the abortion of a surrogate child requires only the written consent of the intending couple.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy, allowing only altruistic surrogacy. This is a key policy decision aimed at preventing exploitation and ensuring ethical practices in surrogacy.  The distinction between altruistic and commercial surrogacy is central to understanding the legal framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the NARTSB to oversee the implementation of the Act, regulate surrogacy practices, and monitor ART clinics.  The creation of this board demonstrates the government's intent to regulate and monitor the sector to prevent misuse and ensure ethical practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The abortion of a surrogate child requires the written consent of both the surrogate mother and the authorization of the appropriate authority, in accordance with the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971. This underscores the need for multiple consents and adherence to existing legal frameworks related to abortion.  This provision reflects the importance of the surrogate mother's autonomy and rights in decision-making.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PWDVA):**

1. The PWDVA defines domestic violence solely as physical abuse.
2.  The PWDVA allows for the filing of complaints only by the aggrieved woman herself.
3.  Reliefs provided under the PWDVA are exclusive and cannot be sought in conjunction with other legal remedies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA provides a broad definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. This wide definition reflects the multifaceted nature of domestic violence and aims to provide comprehensive legal protection.  The inclusive definition is essential for addressing the various forms of abuse women may experience.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PWDVA allows for complaints to be filed by the aggrieved woman, a Protection Officer, or any other person on her behalf.  This provision acknowledges that victims may need support in accessing legal remedies and aims to facilitate access to justice.  The provision for others to file complaints on behalf of the victim is crucial for ensuring access to justice for vulnerable women.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PWDVA explicitly states that its provisions are in addition to other existing laws.  Reliefs under the PWDVA can be sought alongside other legal remedies like divorce petitions or maintenance claims.  The cumulative approach reflects a more holistic approach to addressing domestic violence and ensuring comprehensive legal protection for women.


**5. With reference to the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates the recognition of a person's self-perceived gender identity through a legal process.
2. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons only in employment.
3. The Act establishes a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the central government on policy matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act allows individuals to self-identify their gender, requiring a certificate of identity issued by the district magistrate. This provision recognizes the individual's right to self-determination regarding gender identity, a crucial step in ensuring legal recognition and protection.  The process, while involving official documentation, acknowledges the individual's self-perception as the primary determinant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act prohibits discrimination against transgender persons in a broad range of areas, including employment, education, healthcare, and access to services, not solely in employment. The comprehensive nature of the prohibition reflects a holistic approach to ensuring equal rights and opportunities for transgender individuals. The expansive scope is essential for dismantling systemic discrimination.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act does indeed establish a National Council for Transgender Persons to advise the central government on policy, programs, and legislation related to transgender rights.  The establishment of this council highlights the government's commitment to addressing the specific needs and concerns of the transgender community. This council plays a vital role in policy formulation and implementation.

2. NFHS-5 was conducted in 2019-2021.
3. NFHS-5 data shows that a significant percentage of ever-married women in India have experienced spousal violence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NFHS-5 data does reveal high rates of spousal abuse across several states,  it doesn't indicate Uttar Pradesh as the state with the highest prevalence. Karnataka and other states reported higher percentages.  The variation in prevalence across states highlights the need for targeted interventions based on regional contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. NFHS-5 was indeed conducted during the period of 2019-2021. The specific timeframe is important for understanding the context and limitations of the data.  The time period is relevant to the broader social and political landscape during data collection.

Statement 3 is correct. NFHS-5 data shows a considerable percentage of ever-married women in India have experienced spousal violence, highlighting the widespread nature of this issue.  The data emphasizes the need for addressing domestic violence as a serious public health concern.  The findings are crucial for informing policy and intervention strategies.

1. The PEMSR defines manual scavengers exclusively as those employed to clean human waste from insanitary latrines.
2. The PEMSR mandates the construction of community sanitary latrines by local authorities.
3. The PEMSR provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through financial assistance and skill development programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those cleaning insanitary latrines. It encompasses individuals handling human waste from various sources, including open drains, pits, and railway tracks, regardless of their employment status.  This comprehensive definition reflects the diverse contexts in which manual scavenging occurs.

Statement 2 is correct. The PEMSR places a clear responsibility on local authorities to build and maintain functional community sanitary latrines. This is a crucial aspect of eliminating manual scavenging by providing safe and hygienic sanitation facilities.  The emphasis on community latrines is vital for addressing the root causes of manual scavenging.

Statement 3 is correct. The PEMSR includes provisions for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through financial assistance, skill development training, and support for alternative employment. This rehabilitation aspect is critical for ensuring the dignity and economic empowerment of those previously engaged in manual scavenging.  Providing alternative livelihoods is essential for long-term success in eliminating the practice.


**8. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1. NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 40% in higher education by 2035.
2. NEP 2020 proposes multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees, allowing students to exit with certifications, diplomas, or bachelor's degrees after completing different durations of study.
3. NEP 2020 advocates for the establishment of National Research Foundation (NRF) to promote research and innovation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 40%, in higher education by 2035.  This ambitious target reflects the policy's commitment to expanding access to higher education. The difference of 10%  is significant in terms of policy impact and resource allocation.

Statement 2 is correct. NEP 2020 introduces a flexible framework for undergraduate degrees, allowing multiple exit points with different qualifications based on the duration of study. This allows students to tailor their educational journey to their needs and circumstances. The flexibility offered by this approach is a key innovation in higher education.

Statement 3 is correct. NEP 2020 does propose the creation of the NRF to strengthen research and innovation across India.  The NRF is a central component of the policy's vision for a research-driven higher education system.  The establishment of the NRF reflects a commitment to enhancing research capabilities in the country.



**1. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) can extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond three months from the date of the incident.
2.  Monetary settlements are permitted as a basis for conciliation by the ICC in sexual harassment cases.
3.  The ICC is mandated to make public the identity of the complainant, respondent, and witnesses involved in the inquiry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Act allows the ICC to extend the time limit for filing a complaint beyond three months under specific circumstances.  The ICC has the authority to consider the specific facts and circumstances of each case and can exercise its discretion to extend the deadline if it deems it necessary. This flexibility is crucial to ensure that victims are not unduly penalized for delays in reporting, particularly considering the sensitive nature of sexual harassment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a basis for conciliation. The focus is on redressal through inquiry and appropriate action against the perpetrator, not financial compensation that might trivialize the offense.  The aim is to prevent the silencing or coercion of victims through financial incentives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act strongly emphasizes the confidentiality of the proceedings.  The identity of the complainant, respondent, and witnesses must be protected to safeguard their privacy and prevent further harassment or retaliation.  Public disclosure of this information would directly undermine the purpose of the Act.


**2. With reference to the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The policy explicitly recognizes menstruation as a natural bodily process and aims to ensure a stigma-free experience for all who menstruate.
2.  The policy prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations and aims to ensure equitable access to menstrual hygiene resources only in urban areas.
3.  The policy mandates paid menstrual leave for all workers, mirroring legislation recently implemented in Spain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, explicitly aims to destigmatize menstruation and recognizes it as a natural biological process affecting a significant portion of the population.  The policy seeks to create a supportive and inclusive environment for all individuals during menstruation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the policy prioritizes underserved and vulnerable populations, it does not limit its focus to urban areas. The policy's intention is to address the inequities in access to menstrual hygiene resources across all geographical regions, including both rural and urban populations.  The aim is to achieve universal access.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The policy does not mandate paid menstrual leave.  While Spain has implemented such a policy, the Indian draft policy focuses on providing access to resources and creating a supportive environment, not direct legislative mandates regarding workplace leave.


**3. With reference to the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act prohibits the employment of children below the age of 16 in all occupations.
2.  The Act includes provisions for prohibiting the employment of adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.
3. The Act mandates the establishment of rehabilitation centers for rescued child laborers under the National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below the age of 14 in all occupations.  The age limit is 14, not 16.  This is a crucial distinction in the legal framework.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act specifically prohibits the employment of adolescents between the ages of 14 and 18 in hazardous occupations and processes.  This provision aims to protect young people from particularly dangerous work environments.

Statement 3 is correct. While the NCLP scheme is separate, the Act supports the rehabilitation of child laborers, and the NCLP scheme, with its special schools and rehabilitation centers, is a key component of this rehabilitation process.  The Act's overall goal is not just to prohibit child labor but also to provide pathways for rehabilitation and reintegration into society.


**4. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act defines a child as a person who has not completed 18 years of age, with no exceptions for heinous crimes.
2. The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to assess whether a child aged 16-18 years should be tried as an adult for heinous offenses.
3.  The 2021 amendment to the Act allows for appeals against adoption orders issued by the Child Welfare Committee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2015 Act, while defining a child as a person below 18, allows for exceptions in cases of heinous offenses involving children aged 16-18.  These children can be tried as adults under specific conditions.  This provision has been a subject of debate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act explicitly empowers Juvenile Justice Boards to conduct assessments to determine whether a child aged 16-18 should be tried under the adult criminal justice system for heinous crimes.  This assessment is crucial in balancing the rights of the child with the need for justice.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2021 amendment introduced changes to the adoption process, including the authority to issue adoption orders, but it did *not* allow for appeals against adoption orders issued by the Child Welfare Committee.  The amendment aimed to streamline the process, not expand avenues for appeals.


**5. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, and its amendment rules, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act allows for commercial surrogacy, where surrogate mothers receive monetary compensation beyond basic medical expenses.
2. The amended rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
3.  The Act explicitly permits surrogacy for single women (widows or divorcees) using donor sperm and their own eggs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy.  It allows only for altruistic surrogacy, where the surrogate mother receives only medical expenses and insurance.  This is a central tenet of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The amended rules introduced a crucial clarification regarding the use of donor gametes in surrogacy.  While donor gametes are permissible, at least one gamete must be genetically related to the intending couple.  This condition prevents the complete outsourcing of biological parenthood.

Statement 3 is correct. The amended rules have provisions that permit surrogacy for single women (widows or divorcees) using their own eggs and donor sperm. This represents a significant expansion of access to surrogacy services.  This inclusion is a key change.


**6.  With reference to the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, and subsequent developments, consider the following statements:**

1. The NMC is a constitutional body established under Part XIV of the Indian Constitution.
2. The World Federation for Medical Education (WFME) recognition granted to the NMC ensures automatic accreditation of all existing and new medical colleges in India for the next 10 years.
3. The NMC Act, 2019, repealed the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NMC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established under the NMC Act, 2019, which is legislation passed by Parliament, not a part of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The WFME recognition granted to the NMC does indeed provide automatic accreditation to existing and new medical colleges in India for the next 10 years. This recognition significantly improves the international standing of Indian medical education.

Statement 3 is correct. The NMC Act, 2019, effectively replaced the Indian Medical Council Act, 1956, reforming the regulatory framework for medical education and practice in India.  The older Act was repealed to allow for the establishment of the NMC.

2. NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2030.
3. NEP 2020 proposes the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) across the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NEP 2020 proposes a significant restructuring of the school education system, moving from the existing 10+2 structure to a 5+3+3+4 structure based on age groups.  This change is designed to create a more holistic and flexible learning system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50% in higher education by 2035, not 2030. This is a key target, but the timeline is longer than stated.

Statement 3 is correct.  NEP 2020 advocates for the establishment of MERUs to promote multidisciplinary learning and research.  This is viewed as crucial for fostering innovation and addressing complex challenges.

2.  The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe.
3. The Act provides for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers through alternative employment opportunities and financial assistance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those explicitly employed without protective gear. It includes individuals involved in handling human excreta from insanitary latrines, regardless of their official employment status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their immediate demolition within a fixed timeframe.  The process involves surveys, planning, and phased implementation.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key component of PEMSR is the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.  The Act provides for alternative employment training programs, financial assistance, and other support mechanisms to help them transition to dignified livelihoods.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NRF's funding sources are diverse and include not only central government grants and loans but also donations, investment income, and funds from other sources. The statement is too restrictive.

Statement 2 is correct. The NRF Act, 2023, explicitly repealed the SERB Act, 2008, integrating SERB's functions and responsibilities into the newly established NRF.

Statement 3 is correct. The Prime Minister is indeed the ex-officio President of the NRF Governing Board. This reflects the high priority given to research and development.


**10. With reference to the  Temple of Healing v. Union of India judgment, consider the following statements:**

1. The judgment mandates the immediate transfer of all children in Childcare Institutions (CCIs) to adoptive families.
2. The judgment defines "unfit" parents or guardians to include those who are unable or unwilling to provide adequate care and those engaging in substance abuse.
3. The judgment directs states and union territories to conduct monthly drives to identify children in the Orphaned-Abandoned-Surrendered (OAS) category in CCIs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment does not mandate the immediate transfer of *all* children in CCIs to adoptive families.  It focuses on identifying children who meet specific criteria, such as having absent parents or unfit guardians, for placement in adoption.

Statement 2 is correct. The judgment provides a clear definition of "unfit" parents or guardians, encompassing those who neglect or abuse children, engage in substance abuse, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to provide adequate care.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The judgment directs states and union territories to conduct *bi-monthly*, not monthly, drives to identify OAS children in CCIs.  The frequency is specified as twice a month to ensure regular monitoring.


**1. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) can extend the three-month time limit for filing a complaint of sexual harassment.
2.  Monetary settlements are permitted as a basis for conciliation by the ICC in sexual harassment cases.
3.  If allegations are proven, the ICC recommends action against the perpetrator in accordance with the company's service rules, but cannot directly impose penalties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013, empowers the ICC to extend the timeframe for filing complaints beyond the initial three months in justifiable circumstances. This flexibility acknowledges the complexities involved in reporting such sensitive matters.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act explicitly prohibits monetary settlements as a resolution method during conciliation. The focus remains on redressal and preventing future occurrences, not financial compensation.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the ICC's role; it can recommend disciplinary actions based on the company's service rules but lacks the authority to independently impose penalties. The employer retains the ultimate responsibility for implementing the recommended actions. The Act emphasizes a process-oriented approach that prioritizes justice and the protection of the complainant's rights.


**2. With reference to the Draft National Menstrual Hygiene Policy, 2023, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act does mandate at least 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions for persons with benchmark disabilities. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The reservation does *not* apply to police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police). Statement 3 is correct. The Act defines "person with benchmark disability" as having at least 40% of a specified disability.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**15. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the highest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural levels of technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  The government of India renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as PVTGs in 2003.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Odisha houses the highest number (13) of PVTGs in India, not Madhya Pradesh.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of Scheduled Tribes, this doesn't translate to the highest number of PVTGs.  The question plays on the potential confusion between the overall ST population and the specifically designated PVTG category.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided criteria accurately reflect the government's guidelines for identifying PVTGs. These criteria highlight the vulnerability of these groups due to their traditional lifestyles and socio-economic conditions.  This is a key aspect of understanding the government's approach to tribal welfare.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The government of India renamed PTGs as PVTGs in 2006, not 2003. This seemingly minor detail is a crucial factual element that differentiates a correct from an incorrect answer, demonstrating the need for precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  The slight alteration in the year serves as a potent distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labeled certain communities as 'born criminals,' was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1951.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are approximately 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and 198 DNTs in India, comprising 15 crore Indians.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  This reversal of the factual relationship is a common technique used to create difficult and discerning questions for the UPSC exam.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952, not 1951.  The one-year difference is a subtle but important factual inaccuracy designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Renke Commission's estimate of the number of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs, along with their approximate combined population, is accurately presented. This statement tests the candidate's ability to recall specific numerical data and statistics related to marginalized communities in India.


**3. With reference to measures undertaken for the welfare of DNTs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNT) was established to prepare a state-wise list of castes belonging to DNTs and to provide financial assistance for their rehabilitation.
2.  The Dr. Ambedkar Pre-Matric and Post-Matric Scholarship scheme is exclusively for DNTs students who are not covered under SC/ST/OBC categories.
3.  The Scheme for Economic Empowerment of DNT Communities (SEED) focuses solely on providing free competitive exam coaching to DNT students.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCDNT is responsible for preparing a state-wise list of DNT castes,  its mandate does not include direct financial assistance for rehabilitation.  This statement cleverly combines a true element (the list preparation) with a false one (financial assistance), creating a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Dr. Ambedkar scholarship scheme is specifically targeted at DNT students who are not covered under other reservation categories. This highlights the government's focus on providing educational opportunities to this marginalized community.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SEED scheme is broader than just competitive exam coaching; it also includes health insurance for families and other economic empowerment initiatives.  This statement oversimplifies the scheme's scope, acting as a powerful distractor.


**4. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in government and government-aided higher educational institutions and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, except for police forces.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act specifies the reservation percentages accurately, and the exclusion of police forces is also a correct detail. This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of specific numerical data related to affirmative action for PwDs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 20. This small numerical discrepancy is a common way to create a challenging question.

Statement 3 is correct. The establishment of special courts for faster case resolution is a key provision of the Act.  This demonstrates the Act's intention to provide speedy justice to PwDs.



**5. With reference to Manual Scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a punishment of imprisonment up to 5 years or a fine up to ₹2 lakh, or both, for violations.
2.  The Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits.
3.  The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices and ensure the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes imprisonment up to 2 years and a fine up to ₹1 lakh, not 5 years and ₹2 lakh. This manipulation of numerical data is a common technique used to increase the difficulty level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle *undecomposed* human waste, not decomposed waste.  The subtle change in a single word ("undecomposed" vs. "decomposed") makes a significant difference and tests the candidate's meticulous reading and understanding.

Statement 3 is correct. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem accurately reflects the government's initiative to improve sanitation worker safety and dignity.


**6. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NEP 2020 aims for a GER of at least 50%, not 60%, in higher education by 2035. This slight alteration in the target percentage is a common distractor in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. The 5+3+3+4 structure is a cornerstone of NEP 2020's restructuring of the school education system.

Statement 3 is correct.  The establishment of the NRF is a key initiative under NEP 2020 to boost research and development in India.

3.  The PGI-D report combined data for 2019-20 and 2020-21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 used UDISE+ 2021-22 data and NAS 2021, not 2020-21 and 2020.  The alteration of the years is a common technique to make the question challenging and test the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. No State/UT achieved the highest grade in PGI 2.0, highlighting the challenges in achieving uniform excellence in school education across India.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGI-D report combined data for 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21.  The inaccuracy in the years is designed to test the candidate's ability to precisely remember the data.


**8. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtBUs), consider the following statements:**

3.  Institutions granted DtBU status must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Institutions less than 20 years old can apply, not 15. The difference of 5 years is a key detail that tests precise recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The new regulations allow clusters of institutions managed by *more than one* sponsoring body to apply for DtBU status, not a single one.  This subtle change in wording significantly alters the meaning.

Statement 3 is correct.  The creation of ABC identities and uploading credit scores is a mandatory requirement for institutions granted DtBU status.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF divides education into 8 levels, not 7.  This small numerical difference is a common distractor in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct. Experiential learning is a key component of the NCrF, highlighting its flexibility and inclusivity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NCrF promotes multiple entry and exit options, emphasizing lifelong learning and flexibility, not rigidity.


**10. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes that all students should be proficient in at least four languages.

The primary objective of the Anganwadi Services Scheme (now Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0) is to improve the nutritional and health status of children (0-6 years), pregnant women, and lactating mothers, and to reduce mortality, morbidity, and malnutrition rates.  This is a core function of the ICDS scheme.

Statement 2 is also correct. AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium determined by the central government.  Furthermore, performance-based incentives are offered, particularly for utilizing the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) for data capture and monitoring under POSHAN Abhiyan.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Saksham Anganwadis do focus on infrastructural improvements within AWCs with the addition of technology, it also explicitly extends its focus to adolescent girls (14-18 years) in Aspirational Districts and the North Eastern Region (NER),  along with early childhood care and education initiatives for younger children.  The statement oversimplifies the scheme's scope.


**2. With reference to the initiatives taken to achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ayushman Bharat Yojana is a comprehensive initiative focusing solely on tertiary-level healthcare interventions, aiming to improve access to specialized medical care for all citizens.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's GHI score did show a slight improvement from 29.2 in 2015 to 28.7 in 2023,  this is a minimal change and doesn't represent "significant improvement." The statement exaggerates the progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 report actually identifies South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa as regions with the *highest* levels of hunger, not the lowest.  This indicates a serious challenge in food security in these areas.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's GHI score of 28.7 in 2023 placed it in the "Serious" category, not "Moderate," on the GHI Severity of Hunger Scale. This highlights a significant concern regarding hunger and malnutrition in the country.

1. The Global Indicator Framework (GIF) for SDGs, developed by the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs), currently includes over 300 unique indicators specifically tailored to India's unique requirements.
2. The National Indicator Framework (NIF) in India, developed by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI), is a static framework that does not evolve or adapt to changing needs.
3.  The India-specific indicators within the NIF are entirely independent of the GIF indicators, ensuring complete autonomy in data collection and reporting.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GIF currently includes around 231 unique indicators, not over 300, and while it informs the NIF,  the NIF also includes indicators specific to India's context. The statement inflates the number of indicators and misrepresents the relationship between GIF and NIF.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NIF is not static; it is an evolving framework, constantly adapting and incorporating new indicators to better reflect India's progress toward achieving the SDGs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The NIF aligns with the GIF indicators, but it also includes additional indicators specifically relevant to India's context.  There is a degree of overlap and coordination, not complete independence.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anusandhan NRF has a broad mandate encompassing research in natural sciences (including mathematics, engineering, environmental and earth sciences, health, and agriculture), as well as the scientific and technological interfaces of humanities and social sciences.  The statement is too narrow in its description of the NRF's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NRF Act, 2023, did repeal the SERB Act, 2008, it subsumed SERB's functions into the NRF, not completely dissolving it.  The statement misrepresents the relationship between the two bodies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Anusandhan NRF's funding will come from various sources, including grants and loans from the central government, donations, investment income, and amounts from the Fund for Science and Engineering Research (established under the 2008 Act). The statement is too restrictive in its description of funding sources.

2. The PEMSR Act mandates that local authorities must identify and rehabilitate manual scavengers, but it does not specify any punitive measures for those who employ manual scavengers.
3. The PEMSR Act makes it an offense to construct insanitary latrines, but it does not address the issue of converting existing insanitary latrines into sanitary ones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader, encompassing those who handle un-decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits, in addition to those cleaning sewers and septic tanks without proper protection.  The statement is too narrow in its definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act not only mandates identification and rehabilitation but also specifies penalties (imprisonment up to 2 years or a fine up to ₹1 lakh, or both) for those who employ manual scavengers.  The statement omits a crucial aspect of the law.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PEMSR Act explicitly mandates the demolition of insanitary latrines or their conversion into sanitary latrines within a specified timeframe. The statement wrongly claims the act doesn't address conversion.

2.  ODF Plus villages have sustained their ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems, but not necessarily both.
3.  Achieving ODF status requires that every household and public/community institution uses safe technology for faecal disposal, and no visible faeces are found in the environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The definition of an ODF Plus Model village explicitly includes the display of ODF Plus IEC messages.  The other aspects mentioned are true, but the omission of this crucial detail makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of an ODF Plus village specifies that it maintains ODF status and implements *either* solid or liquid waste management.  It doesn't require both.

Statement 3 is correct.  This accurately reflects the criteria for achieving ODF status as defined in the provided text; the absence of visible faeces and the use of safe disposal methods for every household and public institution.

2.  The 2021 amendment to the MTP Act expanded access to abortion for certain categories of women beyond the 20-week limit.
3. The Act explicitly allows for the termination of a pregnancy in cases where the pregnancy poses a serious threat to the mental health of the pregnant woman.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the MTP Act allows for abortion, the gestational limit and the number of required medical practitioners' opinions vary depending on the circumstances. The statement incorrectly states a universal 24-week limit and the requirement of only two doctors' opinions. Statement 2 is correct. The 2021 amendment significantly broadened access to abortion for specific groups of women, extending the permissible gestational limit beyond 20 weeks in certain situations.  Statement 3 is correct. The MTP Act recognizes that severe threats to the mental health of the pregnant woman are grounds for legal abortion.  The Act aims to provide a humane and legally sound framework for managing pregnancies where continuation poses significant risks to the woman's well-being.

The NAC's role as a meta-accrediting body is a core recommendation. Statement 2 is correct. The committee urged a transition by December 2023, even if NAC's establishment is later. Statement 3 is incorrect.




**1. With reference to the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), consider the following statements:**

1. IFPRI, established in 1971, is a major research center of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR).
2. IFPRI's headquarters are located in Geneva, Switzerland.
3. IFPRI's research focuses primarily on reducing poverty, hunger, and malnutrition in over 60 countries, including India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IFPRI is indeed a major research center of CGIAR, it was established in 1975, not 1971. CGIAR was established in 1971.  This subtle difference in dates is a common distractor in UPSC-style questions. Statement 2 is also incorrect. IFPRI's headquarters are in Washington, D.C., not Geneva, Switzerland.  Geneva is the headquarters of several other UN organizations, making it a plausible distractor. Statement 3 is correct. IFPRI's core mandate revolves around providing research-based policy solutions to alleviate poverty, hunger, and malnutrition, operating in numerous countries including India.  The focus on these key social issues makes this a central aspect of IFPRI's work.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**2. With reference to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNHCR was established by the UN General Assembly in 1960 and is headquartered in New York City.
2. The UNHCR's 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are the foundational legal documents guiding its work in over 130 countries.
3. The UNHCR's 2022 report, "Global Trends: Forced Displacement," highlighted that forced migration due to social and climate crises increased by 30% compared to 2021.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. The UNHCR was established in 1950, not 1960, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City.  These inaccuracies are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the organization's founding and location. Statement 2 is correct. The 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed the cornerstone of UNHCR's legal framework, guiding its operations across numerous countries.  This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the legal basis of UNHCR's actions. Statement 3 is incorrect regarding the percentage increase.  The report indicated a 21% increase in forced migration due to social and climate crises in 2022 compared to 2021, not 30%.  This minor numerical discrepancy is a typical UPSC-style distractor. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

1. GANHRI, established in 1991, is headquartered in Washington D.C., and comprises over 150 national human rights institutions.
2. GANHRI's primary function is to review and accredit National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on the Paris Principles, adopted in 1992.
3. GANHRI's deferral of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) accreditation was primarily due to concerns regarding financial mismanagement within the NHRC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple points. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1991, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not Washington D.C. The number of member institutions is also close to but not exactly 150.  These details are designed to test the candidate's precise recall of GANHRI's details. Statement 2 is largely correct. GANHRI does review and accredit NHRIs according to the Paris Principles, which were adopted in 1993.  However, the year is slightly off, creating a potential distractor.  The core function of accreditation based on the Paris Principles is accurate. Statement 3 is incorrect. The reasons for the deferral of NHRC accreditation included political interference in appointments, involvement of police in probes into human rights violations, and poor cooperation with civil society. Financial mismanagement was not the primary concern. This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific reasons behind the GANHRI decision. Therefore, only statement 2, with minor correction, is completely accurate.


**4. With reference to the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues (UNPFII), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNPFII was established in 1995 by a resolution of the UN General Assembly and is headquartered in Geneva.
2. The UNPFII comprises 18 independent experts, with half nominated by governments and half by indigenous organizations.
3. The UNPFII's mandate includes addressing indigenous issues related to economic and social development, culture, the environment, education, health, and human rights.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNPFII was established in 2000 by a resolution of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly in 1995, and its headquarters are in New York, not Geneva.  The incorrect year and location serve as effective distractors. Statement 2 is correct. The UNPFII does consist of 16 independent experts, with eight nominated by governments and eight by indigenous organizations.  The slight difference in numbers might confuse some candidates. Statement 3 is also correct.  The UNPFII's mandate accurately reflects the listed areas of concern.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the forum's responsibilities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**5. With reference to the  Caste Census in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The caste census is a State subject under the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, included caste data which was published in 2016.
3. The Mandal Commission, in 1980, estimated the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) population to be 42%.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Census is a Union subject (Entry 69 of the Union List) under Article 246 of the Constitution.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions related to the census. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SECC, 2011, did collect caste data, it was not published in 2016; only data excluding caste data was published. This aims to test detailed knowledge of the SECC. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mandal Commission estimated the OBC population at 52%, not 42%.  The incorrect percentage serves as a distractor.  All three statements contain factual inaccuracies; hence, none are correct.


**6. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1. The NIF includes only indicators aligned with the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
2. The Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) developed the NIF in 2017.
3.  The NIF, as of 2023, contains fewer than 250 indicators.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NIF includes indicators aligned with the GIF but also includes indicators tailored to India's specific requirements. This tests the candidate's understanding of the NIF's scope. Statement 2 is incorrect. MoSPI developed the NIF in 2018, not 2017. The incorrect year is a typical distractor. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NIF in 2023 has 284 indicators, which is significantly more than 250. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the number of indicators in the NIF.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.


**7. With reference to the  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5), consider the following statements:**

1. NFHS-5 was conducted in 2020-21 and covered all states and union territories of India.
2. NFHS-5 data revealed a decline in the Total Fertility Rate (TFR) across India compared to NFHS-4.
3. NFHS-5 data showed an improvement in institutional delivery rates for childbirth across all states of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NFHS-5 was conducted during 2019-21, covering all states and UTs.  However, the exact year range might be a point of confusion. Statement 2 is also correct.  NFHS-5 did indeed show a decline in the TFR compared to NFHS-4. This tests the candidate's understanding of demographic trends. Statement 3 is incorrect. While there was an overall improvement in institutional deliveries, it wasn't uniform across all states; some states still showed relatively low rates. This detail tests knowledge of regional variations. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**8. With reference to the  Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Rural Development.
2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) receive a fixed monthly honorarium and are eligible for performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Saksham Anganwadi initiative primarily focuses on improving nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi Services Scheme falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the relevant ministry. Statement 2 is correct. AWWs do receive a fixed honorarium and performance-linked incentives. This tests factual knowledge about AWW compensation. Statement 3 is largely correct but not entirely precise. While improving the nutritional status of children aged 0-6 years is a core objective, Saksham Anganwadi also focuses on adolescent girls and early childhood care and education. The incomplete description aims to test the depth of knowledge about the initiative. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are substantially accurate.


**9. With reference to Manual Scavenging in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013, prescribes a maximum punishment of 5 years imprisonment for violations.

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5 years.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific penalties laid out in the act. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines within a specified timeframe, but not necessarily within one year.  The imprecise timeframe is a common distractor technique. Statement 3 is correct. SRMS does aim to rehabilitate manual scavengers by providing alternative employment opportunities. This tests knowledge of the rehabilitation schemes. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**10. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 structure for schooling, replacing the existing 10+2 system.
2. The NCF-SE mandates the learning of at least four languages at all levels of schooling.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE does propose a 5+3+3+4 structure, a significant change from the older system.  This tests the candidate's awareness of the curricular reforms. Statement 2 is incorrect. It recommends proficiency in at least three languages, not four, with at least two being Indian languages. This tests knowledge of the language policy details. Statement 3 is correct.  The NCF-SE does emphasize scientific inquiry in science education, moving beyond rote learning.  This tests understanding of the pedagogical approach. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**11. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DTBUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

2.  DTBUs are mandated to create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students.
3.  The UGC Act of 1956 empowers the State Governments to declare institutions as DTBUs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Institutions less than 20 years old are eligible, not 10 years. The difference in the number of years is a key distractor. Statement 2 is correct. DTBUs are indeed mandated to create ABC identities for their students.  This tests knowledge of the regulations governing DTBUs. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UGC Act of 1956 empowers the Central Government, not State Governments, to declare institutions as DTBUs. The difference between central and state authority is a crucial distinction. Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct.


**12. With reference to Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FHEIs need UGC approval to establish campuses in India but not to offer programs within those campuses.
2.  FHEIs ranked within the top 1000 globally are eligible to establish campuses in India.
3. FHEIs operating in India are subject to Indian laws, including the Foreign Exchange Management Act (1999).

(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FHEIs require UGC approval for both establishing campuses and offering programs.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the regulatory requirements. Statement 2 is incorrect. The eligibility criterion is a ranking within the top 500 globally, not 1000. The difference in ranking thresholds is a significant distractor. Statement 3 is correct.  FHEIs are indeed subject to Indian laws, including the FEMA.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the legal framework governing FHEIs in India.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**13. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

2.  The NCrF proposes a uniform Notional Learning Hours (NLH) of 1000 hours per year across all levels of education.
3. The NCrF aims to enhance flexibility and mobility among different educational pathways.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCrF does integrate credits across various educational pathways into eight levels. This tests the candidate's understanding of the framework's structure. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The proposed NLH is 1200 hours per year, not 1000. The slight numerical difference serves as a distractor. Statement 3 is also correct.  The NCrF aims to increase flexibility and mobility within the education system. This tests knowledge of the framework's goals. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.




Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Gender Social Norms Index:**

1.  It's released annually by the World Economic Forum and measures gender inequality across four parameters.
2.  The index assesses systematic disadvantages and discrimination faced by women across political, educational, economic, and physical integrity dimensions.
3.  India's 2023 ranking reflects a significant improvement over its 2019 performance, indicating substantial progress in gender equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the Gender Social Norms Index (GSNI), which is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Economic Forum.  The GSNI focuses on societal norms that perpetuate gender inequality across the four dimensions mentioned. Statement 1 is incorrect because it attributes the GSNI to the wrong organization and incorrectly states its annual release.  Statement 3 is factually inaccurate; while India has made some progress in certain areas, its 2023 ranking of 127 out of 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) doesn't represent a significant improvement, and the GGGI is different from the GSNI. The GGGI is a different index released by the World Economic Forum which focuses on different parameters.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) Service Coverage Index (SCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCI tracks SDG 3.8.1 and includes indicators related to reproductive, maternal, and newborn health, infectious diseases, and non-communicable diseases, but excludes service capacity and access.
2.  India's UHC SCI score improved significantly between 2019 and 2021, reflecting substantial advancements in healthcare access and quality.
3. The index is measured on a scale from 0 (best) to 100 (worst), with higher scores indicating better UHC coverage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the UHC SCI *does* include service capacity and access as indicator categories. Statement 2 is false; India's UHC SCI score *declined* from 64 in 2019 to 63 in 2021, indicating a worsening, not an improvement, in UHC coverage.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the scale is from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**3. With reference to the Path to Equal Report and its indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Women's Empowerment Index (WEI) evaluates the status of women relative to men in core dimensions of human development.
2. The Global Gender Parity Index (GGPI) focuses solely on women, measuring their power and freedoms to make choices and seize opportunities in life.
3. Both indices are jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP and provide a comprehensive assessment of gender equality across the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the WEI focuses solely on women's empowerment, not a comparison with men. Statement 2 is incorrect; the GGPI compares women's status to men's in core human development dimensions.  Statement 3 is correct; both indices are indeed jointly prepared by UN Women and UNDP, offering a comprehensive assessment of women's empowerment and gender parity globally.

1.  PVTGs were initially recognized in 1973 as Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) based on recommendations of the Dhebar Commission (1961).
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-industrial level of technology, high levels of literacy, and a growing population.
3.  Odisha currently houses the highest number of PVTGs in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the PVTGs' origins are accurately described.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, *low* literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.  Statement 3 is also correct; Odisha does have the highest number of PVTGs. Therefore, only statement 1 and 3 are correct.


**5. With reference to the measures undertaken for Tribal welfare, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is the nodal ministry responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Tribes (STs) in India.
2. The International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples is observed annually on August 9th to promote and protect the rights of indigenous populations globally.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the reservation percentages are reversed – 4% for government jobs and 5% for higher educational institutions. Statement 2 is incorrect because visual impairments are included among the recognized disabilities. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the act does provide for free education for children with benchmark disabilities. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**7. With reference to Manual Scavenging and the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as individuals employed to handle decomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, or pits.
2.  The Act makes it an offence to construct insanitary latrines but does not address the issue of employing people to clean sewers and septic tanks without protective gear.
3.  The Act mandates local authorities to build and maintain community sanitary latrines but does not provide for the rehabilitation of manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the POSHAN Abhiyan's goals. Statement 2 is incorrect; lactating mothers are a key focus of the NNM. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the NNM plays a major role, it doesn't have *sole* responsibility for monitoring nutrition interventions across all Ministries.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Anganwadi system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anganwadi system is an integral part of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) scheme and is centrally sponsored under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD).
2.  Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive only a fixed monthly honorarium with no performance-linked incentives.

Statement 3 is correct; South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa consistently have high hunger levels. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.



Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. With reference to the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCF-SE proposes a 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for schooling, replacing the existing four-stage system.
2.  NCF-SE mandates that all students must be proficient in at least three languages, with at least one being a foreign language.
3. The NCF-SE emphasizes interdisciplinary areas of study as a separate subject, primarily at the secondary stage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCF-SE indeed proposes a new 5+3+3+4 age-based structure for school education, aiming for a more holistic and integrated approach compared to the previous system.  This restructuring aligns with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NCF-SE strongly promotes multilingualism and the use of Indian languages, it doesn't mandate proficiency in *three* languages, with at least one being a foreign language. The framework encourages proficiency in at least three languages, but these languages are primarily intended to be Indian languages, promoting linguistic diversity and inclusivity within the country. The emphasis is on using the mother tongue or regional languages as the medium of instruction in early years.

Statement 3 is correct. The NCF-SE introduces interdisciplinary areas of study as a distinct subject, particularly at the secondary level. This approach aims to break down traditional subject silos and foster a more integrated understanding of concepts across different disciplines.  This is a key aspect of the shift towards holistic and experiential learning promoted by the NCF-SE.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**2. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1. The PGI 2.0 uses data solely from the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021 to assess state performance.
2.  The PGI-D report combines data from 2019-20 and 2020-21 to evaluate district-level performance.
3. In the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22, at least one state achieved the highest grade ('Daksh').


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGI 2.0 utilizes data from *both* the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) 2021-22 and the National Achievement Survey (NAS) 2021.  It's a comprehensive assessment that considers multiple data points to provide a more nuanced evaluation of state performance in school education.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGI-D report combines data from the academic years 2020-21 and 2021-22, not 2019-20 and 2020-21. This two-year data aggregation allows for a more robust and reliable analysis of trends and performance at the district level.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The report explicitly states that *no* state or union territory achieved the highest grade ('Daksh') in the PGI 2.0 assessment for 2021-22. This highlights the challenges and areas needing improvement within the Indian school education system. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**3. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF is a framework that exclusively integrates credits earned through higher education.
2. The NCrF encompasses the National Higher Education Qualification Framework (NHEQF) and the National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF) but excludes the school education framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCrF is designed to be an *inclusive* framework that seamlessly integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational/skill education. It's not limited to higher education alone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCrF explicitly includes the NHEQF and NSQF, and importantly, also incorporates the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) / National School Education Qualification Framework (NSEQF) for school education.  This comprehensive integration is a key feature of the NCrF.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCrF aims to create a system where credits earned through various educational pathways are easily transferable and recognized, providing flexibility to learners and promoting mobility between different educational streams. This is a core objective of the framework.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**4. With reference to the  'Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016', consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government jobs, including police forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act mandates at least 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs, it specifically *excludes* police forces (Indian Police, RPF, CAPF, Delhi Police, and other UT police) from this reservation provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act indeed recognizes 21 types of disabilities, encompassing a broad range of impairments, including intellectual disabilities and those caused by acid attacks. This expansive definition aims to ensure inclusivity and address the diverse needs of PwDs.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act emphasizes the establishment of special courts in each district to handle cases related to disability rights violations efficiently.  This provision aims to ensure faster justice and effective redressal of grievances for PwDs.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**5. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines manual scavengers as only those employed to clean human waste from insanitary latrines without protective gear.
2. The Act mandates the demolition of all insanitary latrines within a specific timeframe after its enactment.
3.  The Act makes it an offense to construct new insanitary latrines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of manual scavengers is broader than just those cleaning insanitary latrines without protective gear. It includes individuals employed to handle human waste from various sources, including open drains, pits, and railway tracks, irrespective of whether protective gear is used or not.  The crucial aspect is the *handling* of human waste.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Act aims to eliminate insanitary latrines, it doesn't mandate their demolition within a fixed timeframe.  The process involves a phased approach, including conversion to sanitary latrines, and focuses on the eventual elimination of insanitary facilities.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act explicitly prohibits the construction of new insanitary latrines, a key step in preventing the perpetuation of manual scavenging. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. With reference to the Anganwadi system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Anganwadi system is solely funded by the state governments and operates independently of central government schemes.
2. Anganwadi Workers (AWWs) and Anganwadi Helpers (AWHs) receive a fixed honorarium, but no performance-linked incentives.
3.  The Poshan Tracker mobile application is used for monitoring nutrition service delivery and identifying malnutrition prevalence among children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anganwadi system is a Centrally Sponsored Scheme under the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD), meaning it receives funding and guidance from both the central and state governments.  It's not solely funded by state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While AWWs and AWHs receive a fixed monthly honorarium, they also receive performance-linked incentives for utilizing the ICDS-CAS (Common Application Software) under the POSHAN Abhiyan.  This incentivizes effective service delivery.

Statement 3 is correct. The Poshan Tracker app is a crucial tool for monitoring nutrition service delivery at the Anganwadi level and for identifying children who are stunted, wasted, or underweight.  This data is used for targeted interventions.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**7. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The GHI 2023 ranks India among the top 25 countries with the lowest hunger levels globally.
2. The GHI methodology solely relies on data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS).
3. The GHI considers indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GHI 2023 ranks India significantly lower than the top 25 countries, indicating a serious hunger situation.  India's ranking reflects a concerning level of hunger and malnutrition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GHI methodology uses data from multiple sources, not solely from the NFHS.  It incorporates data from various international and national organizations to provide a comprehensive assessment of hunger levels.

Statement 3 is correct. The GHI indeed uses indicators such as undernourishment, child stunting, child wasting, and child mortality to calculate its scores.  These indicators provide a multi-dimensional assessment of hunger and its impact on child health and development. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**8. With reference to the  'Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021', consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly *prohibits* commercial surrogacy and only allows altruistic surrogacy, where no monetary compensation is involved beyond medical expenses.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act establishes the NARTSB to oversee the implementation of the Act, regulate surrogacy practices, and monitor ART clinics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act specifically *restricts* surrogacy to Indian citizens and prohibits it for foreign nationals.  This restriction is aimed at preventing exploitation and ensuring ethical practices. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA has a broader definition of domestic violence, encompassing physical, verbal, emotional, economic, and sexual abuse. It's not limited to physical abuse within a marriage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the aggrieved woman can file a complaint, the Act also allows for complaints to be filed by a Protection Officer or any other person on her behalf, particularly in cases where the woman is unable to do so herself.

Statement 3 is correct. The PWDVA provides civil remedies, and these remedies are in addition to those available under other existing laws, such as those related to divorce, maintenance, or criminal offenses. This ensures a comprehensive approach to addressing domestic violence. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**10. With reference to the  'Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015', consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act defines a child as someone who has not completed 18 years of age.  The age of majority is 18 years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act allows for the transfer of a child aged 16-18 to the adult criminal justice system if they are accused of heinous offenses.  This provision is subject to assessment by a Juvenile Justice Board.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act establishes Juvenile Justice Boards to deal with cases involving children in conflict with the law, ensuring that their rights and needs are considered in the justice process. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI was established in 1993, not 1998, and its headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City. Statement 2 is correct.  GANHRI's core responsibility is the review and accreditation of NHRIs according to the Paris Principles, a set of standards for NHRIs globally. Statement 3 is also correct.  GANHRI's deferral of the NHRC's accreditation was indeed due to concerns regarding political interference in appointments, involvement of police in human rights violation investigations, and insufficient cooperation with civil society organizations.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the UN General Assembly. It also consists of 16, not 12, independent experts. Statement 2 is correct. The UNPFII's mandate explicitly covers the range of indigenous issues mentioned. Statement 3 is incorrect. Government-nominated experts to the UNPFII are elected by the ECOSOC, not the UN Security Council. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prescribes a maximum punishment of 2 years imprisonment, not 5 years, for violations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of manual scavengers in the Act is broader than just those handling undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines; it includes those cleaning sewers and septic tanks without protective gear, and also those working as sweepers in municipalities etc. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Act does not mandate the demolition of all insanitary latrines within one year; it sets a timeframe, but it's not a strict one-year deadline. Therefore, none of the statements are correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act mandates a minimum of 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While states can make recommendations, the final definition of Scheduled Tribes is determined by the President of India through public notification, as per Article 342 of the Constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Madhya Pradesh has a large ST population in absolute numbers, the states with the highest *percentage* of ST population are Lakshadweep and Mizoram. Statement 3 is correct. The Ministry of Tribal Affairs is indeed the nodal ministry responsible for overseeing and implementing policies and programs related to the welfare of Scheduled Tribes in India.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PWDVA primarily provides civil remedies; it doesn't directly initiate criminal proceedings. Criminal charges may be pursued separately under other laws. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PWDVA defines domestic violence broadly, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The PWDVA's protection extends to a wide range of women, including those in live-in relationships, widows, and other women who share a household with the abuser.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly prohibits commercial surrogacy and only allows altruistic surrogacy. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act does create the NARTSB to oversee and regulate surrogacy practices in India. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act restricts surrogacy to Indian citizens and prohibits it for foreign nationals.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, not 15. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act mandates reservations for persons with disabilities, it specifies 4% reservation in government jobs, not 5%. The 5% reservation is for higher educational institutions. Statement 3 is correct. The Act does stipulate the establishment of special courts in each district to expedite the resolution of cases concerning disability rights violations. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**15. With reference to the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR), consider the following statements:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IFPRI is a major research center, it's part of the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), not the FAO.  CGIAR is a global partnership focused on research for food security.  Statement 2 is correct; IFPRI's headquarters and operational scope are accurately described. Statement 3 is partially correct.  While IFPRI does address poverty reduction, its focus is broader than just climate change. It tackles hunger and malnutrition comprehensively,  using research to inform policy solutions across various aspects of food systems and agricultural development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  The UNHCR's headquarters are in Geneva, Switzerland, not New York City, and its mandate extends to refugees, not solely internally displaced persons (IDPs). Though it works with IDPs, its primary focus is international refugee protection. Statement 2 is partially correct.  While the 1951 Convention and its 1967 Protocol are indeed key legal bases, the statement’s emphasis on refugees solely from low-income countries is inaccurate. The UNHCR's work encompasses refugees from all nations. Statement 3 is correct.  The UNHCR's 2022 report accurately documented the global forced displacement figures exceeding 100 million, with a substantial number of children among the displaced.  Therefore, only statement 3 is fully accurate.



**3. With reference to the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), consider the following statements:**

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GANHRI's headquarters are in Geneva, not Paris, and its accreditation criteria are based on the Paris Principles, not solely the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, though the declaration informs the principles. Statement 2 is correct. GANHRI's accreditation process centers on evaluating NHRIs against the Paris Principles, which outline standards for autonomy, competence, and effectiveness. Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that GANHRI deferred the NHRC's accreditation multiple times due to concerns about political interference and cooperation with civil society.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNPFII is a high-level advisory body to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), not the General Assembly.  Also, while eight experts are nominated by indigenous organizations, eight are nominated by governments and then elected by ECOSOC. Statement 2 is correct; the UNPFII's mandate accurately reflects its focus on various aspects of indigenous peoples' well-being. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UNPFII's activities are supported by a Trust Fund on Indigenous Issues, which relies on voluntary contributions, not mandatory ones from member states.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Census is a Union subject (Entry 69 of the Union List) under Article 246 of the Constitution. While states might conduct their own surveys, the national census is a central government responsibility. Statement 2 is incorrect. The SECC 2011 did collect caste data but the data, excluding the caste data, was finalized and published, not the complete data. The caste data remains unpublished. Statement 3 is correct.  Caste-wise data collection was a feature of the census under British rule, continuing until 1931.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

1. The Act permits both altruistic and commercial surrogacy, aiming to regulate the surrogacy industry while ensuring the rights of surrogate mothers.
2. The Act establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB) to oversee the implementation and monitoring of the Act.
3. The Act allows surrogacy for same-sex couples and single women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act only allows altruistic surrogacy, explicitly prohibiting commercial surrogacy to prevent exploitation of surrogate mothers. Statement 2 is correct. The NARTSB is established under the Act to regulate and monitor surrogacy practices. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act has specific eligibility criteria for intending couples, excluding same-sex couples and single women.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**18. With reference to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for the termination of pregnancy up to 24 weeks under certain circumstances, but not beyond 24 weeks unless there is a threat to the mother's life.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The amended Act allows termination up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances, and beyond that only in exceptional cases.  The timeframe for termination is 20 weeks, not 24. Statement 2 is correct. The amended Act requires the consent of one doctor up to 20 weeks. Statement 3 is correct. The Act specifies grounds for legal abortion, including rape and fetal abnormalities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding child labour in India:**

1. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below the age of 16 in all occupations.
2. The National Child Labour Project (NCLP) scheme focuses solely on providing financial assistance to families of child labourers without any focus on rehabilitation or education.
3.  The PENCiL portal is a key tool for rescuing and rehabilitating child labourers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prohibits employment of children below 14 years and restricts adolescents (14-18 years) from hazardous work. Statement 2 is incorrect. The NCLP provides for rehabilitation and education, not just financial aid. Statement 3 is correct. The PENCiL portal plays a crucial role in rescuing and rehabilitating child laborers.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**20. With reference to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines a "child" as a person below the age of 18 years, with no provision for treating certain older adolescents as adults in case of heinous offences.
2. The Act outlines procedures for the adoption of orphaned, abandoned, or surrendered children, with the adoption process being finalized once a Juvenile Justice Board issues an adoption order.
3. The Act categorizes offences committed by juveniles into heinous offences, serious offences, and petty offences based on the severity of the punishment prescribed under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act does allow for children aged 16-18 to be tried as adults in heinous offences, following an assessment. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Adoption orders are not issued by Juvenile Justice Boards; the process involves other authorities like District Magistrates. Statement 3 is correct. The Act categorizes offences based on the severity of the punishment.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):**

1.  Madhya Pradesh has the largest number of PVTGs in India.
2.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs include pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population.
3.  The term "PVTGs" replaced "PTGs" in 2006, based on recommendations from the U.N. Dhebar Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Madhya Pradesh has a high absolute number of STs, Odisha houses the highest number of PVTGs in India (13).  Statement 2 is correct. The criteria for identifying PVTGs are precisely as stated: pre-agricultural technology, low literacy, economic backwardness, and a declining or stagnant population. These factors reflect the vulnerability of these groups. Statement 3 is largely correct.  The Government of India renamed Primitive Tribal Groups (PTGs) as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in 2006.  While the Dhebar Commission (1961) did not directly recommend this renaming, its report on tribal welfare laid the groundwork for the initial identification of PTGs in 1973, which eventually led to the revised terminology. The core concept of identifying and protecting particularly vulnerable tribal groups stems from the concerns raised by the Dhebar Commission.


**2. With reference to De-Notified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following statements:**

1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs, but not all DNTs are nomadic tribes.
2.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which labelled certain communities as "born criminals," was repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952.
3.  The Renke Commission (2008) estimated that there are nearly 15 crore Indians belonging to DNTs and nomadic communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The relationship between DNTs and nomadic tribes is the reverse: all DNTs are nomadic tribes, but not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  DNTs represent a specific subset of nomadic communities that faced historical criminalization. Statement 2 is correct. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory law, was indeed repealed by the Habitual Offenders Act of 1952, although the social stigma and marginalization faced by these communities persisted. Statement 3 is correct. The Renke Commission's 2008 report estimated the combined population of DNTs and nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes to be around 15 crore Indians, highlighting the significant size and vulnerability of these groups.


**3. With reference to the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RPwD Act mandates at least 5% reservation for PwDs in all government and government-aided higher educational institutions, and at least 4% reservation in government jobs, excluding police forces.
2. The Act recognizes 21 types of disabilities, including intellectual disability and acid attack victims, and defines "person with benchmark disability" as someone with at least 40% of a specified disability.
3.  The Act establishes special courts in every district for the faster adjudication of cases under the Act and promotes the participation of PwDs in skill development, sports, and recreation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading.  While the RPwD Act does mandate reservations for PwDs in higher education and government jobs, the exclusion of police forces from the reservation policy is correctly stated. However, the precise percentages might vary slightly depending on the specific provisions and interpretations of the Act. The statement uses the word "at least" which makes it partially correct but not fully accurate. Statement 2 is correct. The Act does indeed recognize 21 types of disabilities, including those mentioned, and the definition of "person with benchmark disability" is accurately given. Statement 3 is correct. The Act does aim to establish special courts (though the implementation may vary across districts) and promotes the inclusion of PwDs in skill development, sports, and recreational activities. The focus on faster adjudication and inclusive participation is a key aspect of the Act.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 (PEMSR):**

1.  The PEMSR Act defines manual scavengers as those employed to handle undecomposed human waste from insanitary latrines, open drains, pits, or railway tracks, regardless of employment type.  An exception is made for those using protective gear.
2.  The Act mandates the demolition or conversion of insanitary latrines and the construction and maintenance of community sanitary latrines by local authorities.
3.  The Act outlines rehabilitation measures for manual scavengers, including training in alternative employment, financial assistance, and help with property purchases, but does not include punishment for those employing manual scavengers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PEMSR Act's definition of manual scavengers is accurately described, including the exception for those using protective equipment.  The Act aims to address the hazardous nature of the work. Statement 2 is correct.  The Act explicitly mandates local authorities to take steps to improve sanitation infrastructure by eliminating insanitary latrines and providing functional, hygienic community facilities.  This is a crucial aspect of preventing manual scavenging. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act does indeed outline rehabilitation provisions for manual scavengers, it also includes provisions for punishment (imprisonment and/or fines) for those who employ manual scavengers, making it a criminal offense.  The omission of this crucial punitive element makes the statement inaccurate.


**5. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGI assesses the performance of the school education system at the state and district levels, based on UDISE+ data and NAS results, classifying entities into ten grades from "Daksh" (highest) to "Akanshi-3" (lowest).
2.  In the PGI 2.0 report for 2021-22, no states/UTs achieved the highest grade ("Daksh"), and Punjab and Chandigarh achieved the top grade ("Prachesta-2").
3. The PGI-D report focuses solely on the financial aspects of school education.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PGI's methodology, grading system, and data sources (UDISE+ and NAS) are accurately described.  The ten-grade classification system is a central feature of the PGI. Statement 2 is correct. The PGI 2.0 report's key findings regarding the absence of "Daksh" grade achievers and the top performance of Punjab and Chandigarh are accurately reflected. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PGI-D report does not focus solely on financial aspects. It encompasses a broader range of factors, including outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety, providing a more holistic assessment of the school education system at the district level.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the PGI-D.


**6.  With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 for higher education, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035 and introduces multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees, including certifications, diplomas, and honours degrees.
2. The NEP 2020 mandates the establishment of Multidisciplinary Education and Research Universities (MERUs) and a National Research Foundation (NRF) to promote research and innovation.
3. The NEP 2020 prohibits the entry of top world universities to open campuses in India and focuses solely on promoting only Indian Institutes of Technology.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NEP 2020's GER target and its emphasis on multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees are accurately stated.  This flexibility aims to cater to diverse learning pathways and career goals. Statement 2 is correct. The NEP 2020 does indeed propose the establishment of MERUs to foster multidisciplinary education and the creation of an NRF to strengthen research and innovation across the country. These are key policy initiatives. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NEP 2020 explicitly encourages the internationalization of education, including allowing top foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The policy aims to enhance the quality and global competitiveness of Indian higher education, and it doesn't focus solely on promoting only IITs.  The statement is a complete misrepresentation of the policy's intent.


**7. With reference to Deemed-to-be Universities (DtbUs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UGC (Institutions Deemed to be Universities) Regulations, 2023, allow institutions less than 20 years old to apply for DtbU status, unlike the 2019 regulations.
2.  Institutions seeking DtbU status must compulsorily create Academic Bank of Credits (ABC) identities for their students and upload their credit scores.
3.  The NCERT was granted DtbU status under the 2019 regulations and this status allows them to offer only undergraduate and postgraduate degrees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2023 regulations significantly altered the eligibility criteria for DtbU status, reducing the minimum age requirement from 20 years to less than 20 years. This change aims to encourage younger, high-performing institutions. Statement 2 is correct. The 2023 regulations mandate the creation of ABC identities and the uploading of credit scores for students in DtbUs. This integration with the ABC system aims to promote credit transfer and academic flexibility. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The NCERT was granted DtbU status under the *2023* regulations, not the 2019 regulations.  Furthermore, the DtbU status allows the NCERT to offer graduate, postgraduate, and doctoral degrees, expanding its academic scope.  The statement contains errors regarding both the year of granting DtbU status and the range of degrees offered.


**8. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Index and related indices, consider the following statements:**

1. The Global Gender Gap Index, released annually by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender equality across four parameters: economic participation, educational attainment, health and survival, and political empowerment.
2. The Gender Social Norms Index, released by the United Nations Development Programme, measures gender equality across four dimensions: political, educational, economic, and physical integrity.
3. India consistently ranks among the top 20 countries in both the Global Gender Gap Index and the Gender Social Norms Index.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Global Gender Gap Index's methodology and parameters are accurately described.  The four dimensions are key components of the index's assessment of gender equality. Statement 2 is correct.  The Gender Social Norms Index's focus on social norms affecting gender equality and its four dimensions are correctly stated.  The index provides valuable insights into the societal factors influencing gender disparities. Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's ranking in both indices is not consistently among the top 20.  In fact, India's ranking tends to be significantly lower, reflecting ongoing challenges in achieving gender equality.  The statement presents a misleadingly positive assessment of India's performance.


**9. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCrF seamlessly integrates credits earned through school education, higher education, and vocational and skill education, encompassing the NHEQF, NSQF, and NSEQF frameworks.
2. The NCrF divides education into eight levels, with levels 1-4 representing school education, levels 4.5-8 representing higher education, and vocational education and training spanning all eight levels.
3.  The NCrF does not allow for multiple entry and exit options. Credits earned can only be used within the same educational institution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NCrF's primary goal of integrating credits across different educational pathways and its inclusion of the mentioned qualification frameworks are accurately described.  This integration aims to enhance educational flexibility. Statement 2 is correct. The NCrF's eight-level structure and the distribution of school, higher, and vocational education across these levels are accurately depicted. This structure facilitates credit accumulation and transfer. Statement 3 is incorrect. A key feature of the NCrF is the provision for multiple entry and exit options, allowing learners to enter and exit the educational system at various points, based on accumulated credits.  The statement misrepresents a core principle of the framework, which is designed to promote lifelong learning and flexibility.  Credits are not restricted to a single institution.


**10. With reference to the initiatives taken to reduce manual scavenging, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem aims to eliminate hazardous cleaning practices, prevent deaths of sewer and septic tank workers, and ensure their safety and dignity.
2. The Self-Employment Scheme for Rehabilitation of Manual Scavengers (SRMS) provides rehabilitation through alternative professions, but it does not provide financial assistance.
3. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana provides concessional loans for the procurement of sanitation-related equipment, but only for government-run sanitation projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The National Policy for Mechanized Sanitation Ecosystem accurately reflects the stated goals of eliminating hazardous cleaning practices and ensuring the safety and dignity of sanitation workers.  Mechanization is a key strategy for reducing manual scavenging. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SRMS scheme does indeed aim to rehabilitate manual scavengers by providing opportunities in alternative professions, and financial assistance is a component of this rehabilitation process.  The statement omits this crucial aspect of the scheme. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Swachhta Udyami Yojana offers concessional loans for sanitation-related equipment to a wider range of individuals and entities involved in sanitation work, not just government projects.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the scheme.


**1. With reference to the ODF Plus model village, consider the following statements:**

1.  An ODF Plus village has sustained its ODF status and implemented either solid or liquid waste management systems.
2.  An ODF Plus model village necessitates arrangements for both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness (minimal litter, stagnant wastewater, plastic waste), and displays ODF Plus IEC messages.
3.  ODF Plus certification requires a village to maintain its ODF status for a minimum of five consecutive years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the criteria for ODF Plus and ODF Plus model villages as defined in the provided text.  Statement 1 correctly describes the basic requirement of an ODF Plus village: sustained ODF status coupled with at least one type of waste management system. Statement 2 accurately details the additional requirements for an ODF Plus *model* village, encompassing both solid and liquid waste management, visual cleanliness, and IEC message display.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text does not specify a five-year timeframe for maintaining ODF status to achieve ODF Plus certification. The duration is not mentioned, making the statement factually inaccurate.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different levels of ODF certification.


**2. With reference to the UNFPA's State of World Population Report 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report projects India to surpass China as the world's most populous country by mid-2023, with a population exceeding 1.42 billion.
2.  The report highlights India as one of the youngest countries globally, with a significant proportion of its population in the 15-64 age group.
3.  The report indicates that India's fertility rate has significantly increased since 2015-16, exceeding 2.5.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the report's findings regarding India's population surpassing China's. Statement 2 correctly notes India's status as one of the youngest countries due to a large working-age population.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The report actually states that India's total fertility rate has *decreased* since 2015-16, falling to 2.0 from 2.2.  This showcases a significant misconception, deliberately introduced as a distractor.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify contradictory information within a complex report summary.


**3. With reference to the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, consider the following statements:**

1.  NEP 2020 aims to achieve a Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) of at least 50% in higher education by 2035.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects NEP 2020's target for GER in higher education. Statement 3 accurately mentions the policy's proposal for MERUs.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While NEP 2020 does propose a flexible 3 or 4-year undergraduate structure, it explicitly *includes* multiple exit options (certificates, diplomas, and degrees), making the statement a deliberate misrepresentation. The question assesses understanding of NEP 2020's key provisions and the ability to identify inaccurate information presented as a plausible distractor.


**4. With reference to the Performance Grading Index (PGI) for school education, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGI 2.0 for States/UTs utilizes data from UDISE+ 2021-22 and NAS 2021 to assess performance.
2.  In PGI 2.0, no State/UT achieved the highest grade ('Daksh'), with Punjab and Chandigarh attaining the top grade ('Prachesta-1').
3.  The PGI-D report focuses exclusively on the academic performance of students, excluding factors like school safety and effective classroom transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the data sources used in the PGI 2.0 assessment. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while no State/UT achieved 'Daksh', Punjab and Chandigarh reached 'Prachesta-2', not 'Prachesta-1'. This subtle alteration in the grade creates a plausible distractor. Statement 3 is entirely false; the PGI-D report explicitly includes outcomes, classroom transactions, and school safety in its assessment criteria.  The question tests factual recall and attention to detail in interpreting numerical data and policy reports.


**5. With reference to the National Credit Framework (NCrF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCrF integrates credits earned through school, higher, and vocational education, encompassing NHEQF, NSQF, and NCF/NSEQF.
2.  The NCrF establishes a rigid, inflexible system with limited entry and exit points for students throughout their educational journey.
3.  The NCrF defines 'notional learning hours' as the time needed for attending classes, tests, and assignments, totaling 1200 hours per year across all educational levels.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the NCrF's integrative nature and the frameworks it encompasses. Statement 3 correctly explains the concept of notional learning hours and their total annual allocation.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the NCrF explicitly aims to enhance flexibility and mobility by allowing multiple entry and exit points, directly contradicting the statement.  The question assesses understanding of the NCrF's core principles and the ability to identify a statement that misrepresents the framework's key features.


**6. With reference to the Global Food Policy Report 2023 (IFPRI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The report highlights a decrease in global food insecurity between 2020 and 2022 due to improved harvests and reduced conflict.
2.  The report attributes the surge in food prices in 2021-22 to supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war.
3.  The report projects that climate change will lead to a significant reduction in undernourishment by 2050.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the report's findings on the causes of food price increases. Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. The report actually indicates an *increase* in food insecurity during 2020-2022 due to various crises and projects that climate change will worsen undernourishment, leading to a substantial *increase* in the number of undernourished individuals by 2050.  The question tests factual recall and the understanding of global food security challenges, using misleading information in statements 1 and 3 as distractors.


**7. With reference to the UNCRC's guidance on children's rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNCRC's guidance emphasizes children's right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment.
2.  The UNCRC's guidance is legally binding on all state parties, mandating specific actions to ensure environmental protection for children.
3.  The UNCRC’s guidance explicitly details the penalties for states failing to protect children's environmental rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the UNCRC's issuance of guidance on children's environmental rights. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the guidance is important, it is not legally binding in the same way as the UN Convention itself.  It provides recommendations, not legally enforceable mandates. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the guidance does not specify penalties for non-compliance. The question assesses knowledge of international children's rights frameworks and the distinction between legally binding instruments and advisory guidance.  The incorrect statements utilize plausible but ultimately inaccurate interpretations of the UNCRC's role and power.


**8. With reference to the  Caste Census in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Census of India is a Union subject under Article 246 of the Constitution.
2.  Bihar's recent caste survey was a full-scale population census, incorporating caste demographics alongside other demographic data.
3.  The Socio-Economic and Caste Census (SECC), 2011, published its caste data in 2016.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly states that the Census of India falls under the Union List.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Bihar's survey was explicitly described as a "social survey" focused on caste, not a comprehensive population census.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the SECC, 2011, *did not* publish its caste data in 2016 or at all.  This creates a potent distractor. The question tests knowledge about the constitutional status of the census and the intricacies of data collection related to caste in India.  The incorrect options use plausible but ultimately inaccurate details to challenge the examinee.


**9. With reference to the National Indicator Framework (NIF) for SDGs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NIF includes indicators aligned with global SDG indicators and indicators tailored to India's specific needs.
2.  The NIF, as of 2023, consists of 248 indicators, mirroring the Global Indicator Framework (GIF).
3.  India, through MoSPI, participated in the Inter-agency and Expert Group on SDG Indicators (IAEG-SDGs) only during 2021-2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the NIF's composition, incorporating both global and India-specific indicators. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NIF in 2023 had 284 indicators, not 248, and this number differs from the GIF.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the passage clearly states that India was a member of IAEG-SDGs during 2015-2017 and 2017-2019 as well.  The question tests knowledge about the NIF and its relationship to the global SDG framework, employing numerical discrepancies and temporal inconsistencies as effective distractors.


**10. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The amended rules permit surrogacy using donor gametes only if at least one gamete is from the intending couple.
2.  The amended rules explicitly allow commercial surrogacy under specific medical circumstances.
3. Single women (widow or divorcee) can utilize donor eggs and their own sperm for surrogacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the amended rules' provision regarding donor gametes in surrogacy. Statement 3 correctly notes the allowance for single women to use their own eggs and donor sperm. Statement 2 is incorrect; the rules maintain the ban on commercial surrogacy, emphasizing altruistic surrogacy. The question tests understanding of the specific regulations surrounding surrogacy in India, utilizing a deliberately misleading statement about commercial surrogacy.  The other options provide plausible but ultimately incorrect interpretations of the rules.
