Pair 4 is correct; the Asur tribe uses mobile radio to transmit news and songs and preserve their language. Pair 5 is correct; Dongria Kondhs reside in Odisha. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy/Scheme                                 Primary Goal/Focus

(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) grants habitat rights to PVTGs and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 wrongly categorized communities as "born criminals." The PVTG scheme explicitly aims at the socio-economic development of PVTGs. PM-JUGA seeks to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. Finally, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 is about providing land rights to forest-dwelling tribal communities.  Therefore, option (c) is correct.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

4.  Jharkhand                                      :   Asur Tribe
5.  Andhra Pradesh                               :   Koya Tribe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Chhattisgarh is home to the Kamar and Baiga tribes. Odisha has Paudi Bhuyans. Madhya Pradesh has Bharias. Jharkhand has the Asur tribe. Andhra Pradesh has the Koya tribe. Therefore, option (b) which includes all five pairs is correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   **Goal**                                      **Specific Intervention**

4. Goal 4: Healthy Lives and Dignified Ageing (SDG 3) : Coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  It outlines four key goals, each with various interventions. Option (c) correctly matches all four goals with their respective interventions. Goal 1 focuses on infrastructure development, including access to healthcare through Ayushman Bharat. Goal 2 aims at economic empowerment, with interventions such as the Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC) playing a crucial role. Goal 3 targets universalizing access to quality education, and setting up tribal hostels is a key strategy in achieving this.  Finally, Goal 4 emphasizes health and well-being, and the use of Mobile Medical Units for immunization coverage directly supports this objective. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The interventions listed are all integral components of the PM-JUGA initiative, directly contributing to the stated goals.  Understanding the interconnectedness of these goals and interventions is crucial for comprehending the holistic approach of the PM-JUGA scheme towards tribal development.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   **State**                                  **PVTG Tribe Mentioned**
1. Odisha                                     :   Paudi Bhuyans
2. Madhya Pradesh                           :   Bharias
3. Chhattisgarh                              :    Kamars
4. Maharashtra                               :   Maria Gond


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided pairs correctly list PVTG tribes found in specific states. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), recognizes the habitat rights of several PVTG groups. Odisha is home to the Paudi Bhuyans, among other PVTGs. Madhya Pradesh includes the Bharias amongst its PVTG population. Chhattisgarh recognizes Kamars as a PVTG, and Maharashtra lists Maria Gond as one of its Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups.  All four pairings are accurate reflections of the geographical distribution of these specific PVTG communities as mentioned in the provided text.  Any option that excludes one or more of these correct pairings would be incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of PVTGs across different Indian states, a critical aspect of understanding the complexities of tribal welfare policies.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                 **Key Focus Area**

This directly matches the description given in the option.  MAHA focuses on solution-oriented research in critical areas, including EV mobility, aligning with the provided pair. Finally, ACE aims to create world-class research centers with significant funding, fulfilling the description.  All three pairs accurately reflect the objectives and functionalities of these ANRF initiatives.  Therefore, option (c) is the only correct answer, as it encompasses all three correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and fail to recognize the comprehensive nature of ANRF's approach to research development.


**4. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   **Funding Source**                           **Scheme Feature**
1. Existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants :  Coverage of around 63,000 villages
2. Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes :  Tenure of 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29)
3. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                     :   Provision of pucca houses for eligible households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA scheme draws its funding from existing resources allocated under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) which is provided through Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, accurately reflecting the funding mechanism. The scheme is designed to cover approximately 63,000 villages, and its implementation is planned for a five-year period, from 2024-25 to 2028-29. Furthermore, one of the key objectives of PM-JUGA is to provide pucca houses to eligible tribal households, leveraging existing schemes like PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin).  All three pairs correctly link the funding sources and features of the PM-JUGA scheme.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete and fail to capture the entire scope of PM-JUGA's funding and implementation aspects.  Understanding the funding sources and the scheme's coverage is crucial for evaluating its effectiveness and reach.


**5. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   **Aspect of the Convention**                **Specific Provision**
1. Objective of the Convention                 :  Promote full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities
2. Definition of Persons with Disabilities     :  Includes those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments
3.  International Initiatives Related to UN-CRPD : Adoption of Incheon Strategy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a comprehensive international treaty focused on promoting and protecting the rights of people with disabilities.  The primary objective of the UN-CRPD is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, as stated in the first pair.  The convention defines persons with disabilities inclusively, encompassing those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, which is accurately reflected in the second pair.  Finally, the Incheon Strategy, aimed at making the rights of persons with disabilities real, is directly related to and supportive of the UN-CRPD, correctly matched in the third pair.  All three pairs accurately represent key aspects of the UN-CRPD and its associated initiatives.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incomplete and fail to capture the comprehensive nature of the UN-CRPD's scope and objectives.  Understanding the key provisions and related international initiatives is crucial for assessing the impact and effectiveness of the convention.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Ministry/Organization
1. PM-JUGA                                              Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates            National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
3. Swadesh Darshan                                      Ministry of Tourism
4.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)    Ministry of Education
5. Food Waste Index Report 2024                        World Health Organization (WHO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) is indeed an initiative under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Swadesh Darshan is a central government scheme under the Ministry of Tourism to develop theme-based tourist circuits. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a methodology to rank educational institutions across the country and is implemented by the Ministry of Education.

Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of NIRF with the Ministry of Education. Option (c) is incorrect as the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates are derived using the System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011, a global standard framework, and not specifically produced by the NSSO. While NSSO contributes to health data collection, the NHA estimates are a broader compilation of data from various sources.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Food Waste Index Report 2024 is published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), not the WHO.  The WHO plays a crucial role in global health but is not the direct publisher of this specific report. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Tribal communities in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Category                                 Characteristic/Location
1. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)       :   Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                          :   Designated as "criminal tribes" under British rule
3. Juangs                                              :   Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes in Odisha
4. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes                   :   Exclusively hunter-gatherer communities
5.  Habitat Rights                                     :    Section 3(1)(e) of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PVTGs are indeed categorized as the most vulnerable tribal groups, and Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra have significant PVTG populations.  DNTs were historically labeled "criminal tribes" under British colonial legislation. The Juangs are a specific tribal group inhabiting Keonjhar and Mankidia in Odisha. Habitat rights for PVTGs are explicitly mentioned in Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  However,  Not all nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes are exclusively hunter-gatherer communities; they encompass a wider range of livelihood strategies including pastoralism and other trades. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                     Organization/Agency
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024    :    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)                 :    Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                       :    UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment      :  National Sample Survey Office (NSSO)
5.  ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’ :   World Bank

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is indeed published by the FAO.  The Global Report on Food Crises is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), which is a part of the GNAFC's work. The Food Waste Index Report is a joint publication of UNEP and WRAP. The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is an initiative by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the NSSO. The report ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’ is published by GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) not the World Bank.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to International Organizations and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                      Focus Area
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD)  :    Promoting inclusive, barrier-free societies
2. Biwako Millennium Framework                            :    Enhancing healthcare access for marginalized groups
3. World Health Assembly (WHA)                              :    Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
4.  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)            :   Reducing gender inequalities in the agri-food sector
5.  Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings    :   Assessing universities across five key areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry engagement and international outlook

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD explicitly aims to promote the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities, which includes working towards inclusive and barrier-free societies. The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO and is directly involved in amending the IHR. GAIN focuses on improving nutrition and reducing gender inequalities in the agri-food sector. THE World University Rankings assess universities across the five key areas mentioned. The Biwako Millennium Framework focuses on creating an inclusive and barrier-free society for persons with disabilities, not specifically on enhancing healthcare access for marginalized groups.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Institution/Organization                      Location/Affiliation
1. IIT Madras                                      :   Overall Top Rank in NIRF 2024
2. IISC Bangalore                                   :   Top-ranked Indian University in THE World University Rankings 2025
3. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham                      :   Top-ranked Indian University in THE University Impact Rankings 2024
4.  University of Southampton                       :   First international university to set up a campus in India under UGC Regulations, 2023
5. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)   :   Top-ranked Indian Institution in QS World University Rankings, 2025


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

IIT Madras did indeed top the overall category in NIRF 2024. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian university in THE University Impact Rankings 2024. The University of Southampton received the first Letter of Intent to establish a campus in India under the new UGC regulations. IIT Bombay was the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025. However, IISc Bangalore is not the top-ranked Indian University in the THE World University Rankings 2025;  it was ranked within the 251-300 bracket. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                  :   Associated Entity/Feature
1. System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 :   World Health Organization (WHO)
2. National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016 :  Eurostat
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024         :   Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)
4. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) :  SDG 12.3.1 (b)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 is a global standard framework developed through a joint cooperation among the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Health Organization (WHO), and Eurostat.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016, are derived within the framework of SHA 2011, but the guidelines themselves are an Indian initiative.  Eurostat's involvement is not directly stated in the provided text regarding the Indian guidelines.  Hence, pair 2 is incorrect.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a collaborative effort between the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), making pair 3 correct.  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is an independent organization focused on nutrition; while it relates to SDG 12.3.1 (b) (halving per capita global food waste),  it's not directly its custodian or associated entity in the same way WRAP is to the FWI report. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Initiative                       :   Key Focus/Characteristic
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2, Zero Hunger
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)    :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
3. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment :   Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)
4.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) : Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, directly addresses the progress (or lack thereof) towards achieving SDG 2, Zero Hunger, making pair 1 correct. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), thus pair 2 is also correct. The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment includes Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) among its targets for assessment, validating pair 3. The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a system for evaluating prior knowledge and skills; while GER (Gross Enrolment Ratio) reflects the status of higher education, it is not a direct focus or characteristic of RPL. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.


**3. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Category Ranked                      :   Top-Ranked Institution
1. Overall Category                      :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
2. Universities Category                 :   IIT Madras
3. Open Universities Category           :   IGNOU (Example, not explicitly stated in text)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings explicitly state that IIT Madras topped the Overall category for the sixth consecutive time.  IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category, not the overall category. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Pair 2 is correct. The text mentions the addition of a new category for Open Universities, but it does not name the top-ranked institution. While IGNOU is a prominent open university, the provided text doesn't confirm its top ranking in 2024.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect due to lack of information in the text. Only pair 2 is correctly matched based on the provided information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     :  Primary Objective/Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
2. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan :  Convergence of different schemes for tribal communities
3.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) :   Digital storage of academic credits
4.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) :  EV mobility research


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, including improving infrastructure of schools and hostels.  Therefore pair 1 is correct.  PM-JUGA's objective explicitly includes convergence of schemes to address the needs of tribal communities, making pair 2 correct. ANRF's initiatives include support for research in areas like EV mobility, making pair 4 correct. The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) focuses on using technology to enhance learning, not specifically on digital storage of academic credits (that's a feature of Academic Bank of Credit under NEP).  Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.


**5. With reference to amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                               :   Specific Feature
1. Defining Pandemic Emergency           :   "Wide geographical spread" criterion
2. Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism :   Addressing needs of developing countries
3. Creating National IHR Authorities      :   Improving coordination among countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR 2005 include a definition of pandemic emergency that incorporates a "wide geographical spread" criterion, making pair 1 correct.  A coordinating financial mechanism was established to specifically address the needs of developing countries, thus pair 2 is correct. The creation of National IHR Authorities is aimed at improving coordination among countries, validating pair 3.  All three pairs accurately reflect features of the IHR amendments.


**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

    Convention Feature                                 Detail
    1. Year of Adoption                            :   2008
    2. Number of Signatories (including India)     :   164
    3.  Objective                                   :   To promote respect for inherent dignity of all persons with disabilities.
    4. Definition of Persons with Disabilities     :   Those with long-term intellectual impairments only.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect regarding the year of adoption.  The convention has 164 signatories, including India, making statement 2 correct.  The objective of the UN-CRPD is indeed to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. This makes statement 3 accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the definition of persons with disabilities within the UN-CRPD is broader, encompassing those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, not just intellectual impairments.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are thus incorrect due to the inclusion of false statements. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of international conventions and their objectives is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                              Detail
    1. Named after                               :  Vallabhbhai Patel
    2.  Primary Objective                         :   Improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
    3. Funding Source                             :   Exclusively from newly allocated funds.
    4.  Duration                                  :   5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, not Vallabhbhai Patel, making statement 1 incorrect. The scheme's primary objective is to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, making statement 2 correct.  The funding for PM-JUGA comes from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not exclusively from newly allocated funds, making statement 3 incorrect. The scheme's duration is indeed 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), making statement 4 correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair related to Birsa Munda and the funding source. Option (b) correctly identifies the pairs that are accurately matched.  Knowledge of government schemes and their features is vital for the UPSC examination.


**3. With reference to the QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking Feature                                    Detail
    1.  Top-ranked Indian Institution (QS)             :   Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
    2.  Top-ranked Indian University (THE Impact)      :   Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)
    3. Number of Performance Indicators (QS)         :  9
    4.  Number of Indicators used by THE ranking      :   18

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings has IIT Bombay as the top-ranked Indian institution, not Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, making statement 1 incorrect.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham topped the THE University Impact Rankings, not the QS rankings, making statement 2 incorrect. The QS rankings use 9 performance indicators, making statement 3 correct. The THE World University Rankings uses 18 indicators, making statement 4 correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs concerning the top-ranked Indian institutions in the two ranking systems. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Understanding different global ranking systems and their methodologies is important for a comprehensive understanding of higher education in India.


**4. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation Feature                              Detail
    1.  First international university to set up a campus in India under UGC regulations, 2023: University of Southampton
    2.  Minimum Global Ranking for eligibility      :   Top 100 globally
    3.  Regulatory Body                             :  Ministry of Education
    4.  Aim of UGC Regulations, 2023              : To provide an international dimension to Higher Education.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 4 only
    (b) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (c) 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The University of Southampton is indeed the first international university to establish a campus in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, making statement 1 correct. The regulations stipulate that Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked in the global top 500, not top 100, making statement 2 incorrect.  The UGC, not the Ministry of Education, is the regulatory body, making statement 3 incorrect. The aim of the regulations is to provide an international dimension to higher education, making statement 4 correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inclusion of incorrectly matched pairs concerning the ranking criteria and the regulatory body. Option (a) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.  Knowledge of recent policy changes in higher education is essential for the UPSC exam.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    NIRF Feature                                   Detail
    1. Year of Launch                               :   2016
    2.  Top-ranked institution (Overall Category)   :   IIT Madras
    3. Implementing Agency                         :   National Board of Accreditation (NBA)
    4. Number of Parameters used for ranking        :   5


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2016, making statement 1 incorrect. IIT Madras did top the Overall category in the 2024 rankings, making statement 2 correct. The NBA, in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre, is the implementing agency, making statement 3 correct.  Five parameters are used for ranking, making statement 4 correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the incorrectly matched pair related to the launch year. Option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Familiarity with the NIRF ranking system and its methodology is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**6. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy Feature                                   Detail

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 3 and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
    (d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The vision statement of the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 is indeed "Sports for Nation Building – Harness the Power of Sports for Nation's Holistic Development", making statement 1 correct. The policy outlines five pillars, not four, making statement 2 incorrect.  The policy does focus on indigenous games, making statement 3 correct.  The policy aims to harmonize with the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, making statement 4 correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair related to the number of pillars. Option (a) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.  Understanding the key features of the draft National Sports Policy is essential for UPSC preparation.


**7. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following pairs:**

    Health Indicator                                    Trend in 2021-22 (since 2017-18)

    2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as % of THE :   Increased
    3.  Current Health Expenditures (CHE) as % of THE  :   Increased
    4.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as % of THE : Decreased

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, not decreased, in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18, making statement 1 incorrect.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE did increase, making statement 2 correct. Current Health Expenditures (CHE) as a percentage of THE decreased, not increased, making statement 3 incorrect. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased, making statement 4 correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs related to THE and CHE. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding health expenditure trends and their implications is important for UPSC aspirants.


**8. With reference to the  Lakhpati Didi initiative, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative Feature                                  Detail
    1.  Launched in                                    :   2022
    2.  Target Number of Lakhpati Didis                 :   3 crore
    3.  Annual Household Income Threshold              :   Rs. 1 Lakh or more
    4.  Ministry responsible                          :   Ministry of Rural Development


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2, 3 and 4 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi initiative was launched in 2023, not 2022, making statement 1 incorrect. The target is indeed 3 crore Lakhpati Didis, making statement 2 correct. The annual household income threshold is correctly stated as Rs. 1 Lakh or more, making statement 3 correct. The Union Ministry of Rural Development is indeed responsible, making statement 4 correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inclusion of the incorrectly matched pair related to the launch year. Option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding government initiatives aimed at women's empowerment is crucial for UPSC preparation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Provision/Feature
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005  :   Successor to International Sanitary Regulations (1951)
2. MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                   :   Increased gestation period for abortion up to 24 weeks under certain conditions
3.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006            :   Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
4.  The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :  Enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 explicitly replaced the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, establishing a new framework for global health security.  The MTP (Amendment) Act of 2021 significantly broadened the gestational limit for legal abortion in India, particularly for specific categories of women. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) includes the provision of habitat rights for PVTGs.  Finally, the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, was indeed enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, which allows for special provisions for women and children.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                   Objective/Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Named after Birsa Munda
2. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) :   Aims to make public spaces accessible to persons with disabilities
3.  Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)     :   Provides financial assistance for purchase/fitting of assistive devices
4.  National Policy for PwDs, 2006                  :   Mandates government programmes to safeguard the rights of PwDs for an adequate standard of living


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the objectives and key features of the respective schemes and acts. PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader. The Accessible India Campaign focuses on improving accessibility for people with disabilities. DDRS offers financial aid for assistive devices. The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, aims to ensure an adequate standard of living for PwDs.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                     Key Provision/Focus
1. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023                   :   Defines and addresses cruelty towards married women
2.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :   Regulates the use and trafficking of narcotics
3.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005 : Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally
4.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :   Provides for the termination of pregnancies by registered medical practitioners


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key provision or focus of the mentioned act or regulation. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, includes provisions addressing cruelty against married women. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is a comprehensive law regulating narcotic substances. The UNESCO Convention on Doping in Sport aims for international harmonization of anti-doping rules. The MTP Act, 1971, legalizes abortion under specific conditions.  Thus, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Convention                 Key Feature/Objective
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Entered into force in 2008
2.  Incheon Strategy “To make the Right Real”              :   Focuses on disability inclusion in Asia and the Pacific
3.  Biwako Millennium Framework                         :   Works towards an inclusive society for persons with disabilities
4.  Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region :  Promotes full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately reflect the key features and objectives of the respective international initiatives. The UN-CRPD did indeed enter into force in 2008. The Incheon Strategy specifically targets disability inclusion in the Asia-Pacific region. The Biwako Millennium Framework promotes an inclusive society. The Declaration on Full Participation and Equality focuses on the full enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of international initiatives related to disability rights.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Body/Committee                                       Function/Composition
1.  World Health Assembly (WHA)                        :  Decision-making body of WHO
2.  Primary Medical Board (PMB) in Euthanasia Guidelines :   Comprises at least 3 members
3.  States Parties Committee (IHR)                     :   For effective IHR implementation
4.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)                  :   Presiding Officer must be a senior woman employee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two pairs are correctly matched. The WHA is indeed the decision-making body of the WHO. The States Parties Committee under the IHR framework is responsible for effective implementation. However, the PMB in euthanasia guidelines is comprised of at least *one* treating physician, not necessarily three.  The ICC does require a senior woman employee as the presiding officer.  Option (a) is incorrect because more than one pair is correct. Option (c) is incorrect as one pair is mismatched. Option (d) is incorrect because at least two pairs are correct. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different organizations and their functions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Feature
1.  Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993    :   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
2.  91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003        :   Limited the number of ministers to 15% of Lok Sabha strength
3.  97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011        :   Made the right to form cooperatives a fundamental right
4.  Disaster Management Act, 2005                 :   Established the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF) and State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the NHRC as a statutory body to promote and protect human rights. The 91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003, capped the total number of ministers, including the Prime Minister, at 15% of the Lok Sabha's total membership.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, significantly strengthened the cooperative movement in India by enshrining the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(c). Finally, the Disaster Management Act, 2005, created the NDRF and SDRF to facilitate disaster response and management at national and state levels, respectively. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of significant legislative acts and their core provisions, demonstrating an understanding of the Indian legal and administrative framework.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Convention                     Key Provision/Feature
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Adopted in 2006, entered into force in 2008
2.  Incheon Strategy “To make the Right Real”          : Focuses on disability inclusion in Asia and Pacific
3.  Biwako Millennium Framework                       : Aims for an inclusive, barrier-free, rights-based society for persons with disabilities
4.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005       : Defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health emergencies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was indeed adopted in 2006 and came into force in 2008. The Incheon Strategy explicitly focuses on making rights real for persons with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.  The Biwako Millennium Framework directly addresses the creation of an inclusive and barrier-free society for people with disabilities. The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, amended recently, establishes a framework for countries to address public health emergencies that have the potential to cross borders.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, demonstrating knowledge of international initiatives and conventions related to disability rights and global health. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. With reference to Tribal Communities in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Community/Act/Scheme                                    Characteristic/Objective
1.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
2.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) : Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3.  Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) : Serves as a model for PM-JUGA
4.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                             :  Repealed in 1949, formerly 'notified' certain communities as 'born criminals'

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of India's policies and legislation concerning tribal communities. PM-JUGA explicitly aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The Forest Rights Act, 2006, indeed grants habitat rights to PVTGs. PM-JANMAN's success informed the design of PM-JUGA. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed, but its discriminatory nature against certain communities is a matter of historical record.  Thus, option (d) encompassing all correctly matched pairs is the correct choice. This question tests knowledge of government schemes, legislation, and historical context related to tribal welfare in India.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to Child Protection in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                       Key Provision/Focus
1.  Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA) :  Prohibits child marriage and provides relief to victims.
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Provides for care and protection of children at risk of child marriage.
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :  Prohibits child labor in all occupations for children below 14 years.
4.  Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme                    : Aims to prevent child marriages and promote girls' education.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the key focus of the respective Act or Scheme. The PCMA directly addresses the issue of child marriage, prohibiting it and providing support mechanisms for victims. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, includes provisions for the care and protection of children vulnerable to child marriage. The Child Labour Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations.  The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme aims to address the issue of gender inequality, which includes preventing child marriages and promoting the education of girls.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. The question tests knowledge of Indian laws and schemes related to child protection and welfare. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Supreme Court Judgement                                    Key Ruling/Observation
1.  Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others                         : Struck down caste-based discrimination in prisons.
2.  Society for Enlightenment and Voluntary Action v. UoI   : Held that PCMA cannot be superseded by personal laws.
3.  Child in Conflict with Law (CCL) through his mother v. State of Karnataka :  Specified the court for appeals against JJB preliminary assessment.
4.  Indra Sarma v. VKV Sarma                              : Affirmed that mutual live-in relationships are not illegal if both partners are unmarried.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly link Supreme Court judgements with their key rulings.  The *Sukanya Santha* case decisively struck down caste-based discrimination within prisons.  The *Society for Enlightenment* case reinforced the supremacy of the PCMA over conflicting personal laws and traditions.  The *Child in Conflict with Law* case provided clarity on the appellate process for juvenile justice cases. Finally, the *Indra Sarma* case legally recognized consensual live-in relationships between unmarried adults. Therefore, option (d) is correct, demonstrating an understanding of significant Supreme Court judgements and their implications for various legal and social issues in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  The question tests the ability to recall and connect landmark Supreme Court cases with their respective legal pronouncements.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Convention                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 18 years in all occupations.
2. ILO Convention No. 182                      : Deals with minimum age of employment.
3. Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006       : Defines a child as a male under 21 and a female under 18.
4. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Primarily addresses child marriage prevention.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, accurately defines a child's age for marriage purposes as under 21 for males and under 18 for females.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations, not all occupations for those under 18.  The act includes exceptions for family enterprises and certain artistic or sporting activities.

Pair 2 is incorrect as ILO Convention No. 182 focuses on the worst forms of child labor, not the minimum age of employment.  That is addressed by ILO Convention No. 138.

Pair 4 is incorrect. While the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, includes provisions for the care and protection of children at risk, its primary focus is not child marriage prevention; it addresses broader issues of juvenile justice.  Other acts specifically target child marriage.


**2. With reference to the legal framework for persons with disabilities in India, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Policy                                      Key Feature
1. National Policy for PwDs, 2006                 : Mandates limited guardianship for all PwDs.
2. RPwD Act, 2016                               : Provides for 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs.
3. Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992     :  Deals with the regulation of rehabilitation professionals.
4. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan), 2015 : Aims to create a barrier-free environment for PwDs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The RPwD Act, 2016, indeed provides for at least 5% reservation in government jobs for PwDs. The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) aims to make public spaces accessible to PwDs.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, does not mandate limited guardianship for *all* PwDs. Limited guardianship is a provision for those who lack the capacity to make decisions, even with support.

Pair 3 is correctly matched.  The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, regulates the profession of rehabilitation professionals.  It does not, however, address the specific needs of disabled people in employment.


**3. With reference to the legal framework concerning abortion in India, consider the following pairs:**

Act/Amendment                                   Provision
1. MTP Act, 1971                                 : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks under specific circumstances.
2. MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                   :  Extends the permissible abortion period to 28 weeks.
3. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023                 : Contains provisions related to causing miscarriage.
4. Supreme Court ruling of 2022                 :  Extends abortion rights to married women only.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The MTP Act, 1971, initially allowed abortions up to 20 weeks,  with later amendments increasing this limit (though not to 24 weeks in all cases).  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, includes provisions related to causing a miscarriage.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, increased the time limit for abortion, but not to 28 weeks. The exact time limit depends on various factors, including the woman's health and the presence of fetal abnormalities.

Pair 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling of 2022 extended abortion rights up to 24 weeks for unmarried and single women, not exclusively married women.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

Scheme/Act                                   Primary Focus
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
2. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme             : Preventing child marriages and promoting girls' education.
3. Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)  : Skill development for persons with disabilities.
4.  National Action Plan to Prevent Child Marriage  :  Providing support to girls at risk of early marriage.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA focuses on improving the lives of tribal communities. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao tackles gender inequality and child marriage. DDRS aids the rehabilitation and skill development of persons with disabilities. The National Action Plan directly addresses the prevention of child marriage.  There is no mismatch between the scheme/act and its primary focus in any of the pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation/Scheme                                     Prominent Feature/Provision
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :  Applicable only to Hindu women
2. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment based on Vishaka Judgement
3.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 Amendments   :  Established a States Parties Committee for effective implementation
4.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Entered into force in 2006


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is applicable to all women irrespective of religious affiliation, unlike option 1 suggests.  The POSH Act, 2013, correctly aligns its definition of sexual harassment with the Supreme Court's Vishaka Judgement. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, indeed established a States Parties Committee.  The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2006, making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as only one pair is not correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect because, while pair 3 is correct, pair 1 is not. Option (d) is incorrect because pair 4 is factually wrong regarding the entry into force date.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
1.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve infrastructure in urban tribal areas
2.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Named after Birsa Munda
3.  National Health Accounts Estimates : Released by the Ministry of Finance since 2013-14
4.  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality: Launched in Davos 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in rural areas, not just urban areas as stated in pair 1, making it incorrect.  Pair 2 correctly identifies the scheme's namesake as Birsa Munda. The National Health Accounts Estimates are released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Finance, making pair 3 incorrect. Pair 4 is correctly matched as the Alliance for Global Good was launched in Davos 2024. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes and their objectives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                     Characteristic/Function
1. Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) : Set up only in organizations with 50 or more employees
2.  Local Complaints Committee (LCC) : Handles complaints from the organized sector
3.  World Health Assembly (WHA) :  Appoints the Director-General of the World Bank
4.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) : Subsumed the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

ICCs are mandated for organizations with 10 or more employees, not 50, making pair 1 incorrect. LCCs handle complaints from the unorganized sector, making pair 2 incorrect. The WHA appoints the Director-General of the WHO, not the World Bank, making pair 3 incorrect. The ANRF subsumed SERB, not ICMR, making pair 4 incorrect. This question tests knowledge of specific details about organizations and their functions, requiring precise factual recall.  All pairs are incorrectly matched, highlighting the importance of accurate information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Ranking                                     Key Feature/Finding
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025 : IIT Delhi is the top-ranked Indian institution
2.  University Impact Rankings 2024 : India is the least represented country
3.  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) Report : Ranked India 108th in 2021
4.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Allows only top 100 global universities to set up campuses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) None
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

According to the provided text, IIT Bombay, not IIT Delhi, is the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS rankings, making pair 1 incorrect. India is the most represented country in the University Impact Rankings, not the least, making pair 2 incorrect.  India's ranking in NFHS-5 report was 108th in 2022, not 2021, making pair 3 incorrect. The UGC regulations allow universities ranked in the global top 500, not just the top 100, to establish campuses in India, making pair 4 incorrect.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies.  None of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Amendment/Policy                                    Provision/Feature
1.  National Policy for PwDs 2006 :  Mandates 2% reservation for PwDs in government jobs
2.  RPwD Act, 2016 : Introduced the concept of limited guardianship for PwDs
3.  The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1993 :  Introduced the Panchayat system in urban areas
4. Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution : Empowers the legislature to make special provisions for men


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, mandates 4% reservation in government jobs, not 2%, making pair 1 incorrect. The RPwD Act, 2016, correctly introduced limited guardianship, making pair 2 correct. The 73rd Amendment Act introduced the Panchayat system in rural areas, not urban areas, making pair 3 incorrect. Article 15(3) empowers the legislature to make special provisions for women and children, not just men, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of specific details about legislation and constitutional provisions concerning persons with disabilities.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of related but different policies and acts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Feature/Initiative
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :   Biwaco Millennium Framework
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)                :   Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)
3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)                 :   Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings
4.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)          :   Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is indeed linked to the Biwako Millennium Framework, which aims for an inclusive society aligning with the UN-CRPD's objectives.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) launched the Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) as a key initiative to support research in priority areas.  Further, Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) utilizes funding from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST).  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because NIRF is an Indian ranking framework, not directly connected to the global Times Higher Education rankings, although both assess institutions. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, missing correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Framework/Report                           Key Characteristic/Finding
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                   :   Iceland ranked 1st
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022                :   India ranked 108th
3. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                   :   India's GHI score improved since 2000
4.  Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings 2024   :   India is the most-represented country

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly placed Iceland at the top. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 accurately reflects India's ranking. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report does indicate an improvement in India's score since 2000. Finally, the THE University Impact Rankings 2024 correctly highlights India's significant presence.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because while Iceland's ranking is correct, the question asks for pairs that are ALL correct.  Option (c) is incomplete and (d) while containing correct pairs, is not exhaustive of all correct pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                        Primary Focus/Objective
1.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
2.  National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India   :   Tracking total health expenditure as a percentage of GDP
3.  Forest Rights Act (FRA)                              :   Recognizing habitat rights for particular vulnerable tribal groups (PVTGs)
4.  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality :   Women’s health, education, and enterprise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the primary focus or objective of the given scheme or initiative. PM-JUGA aims for socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities. NHA estimates indeed track health expenditure relative to GDP.  The FRA explicitly addresses habitat rights for certain tribal groups.  The Alliance for Global Good focuses on improving women's conditions in health, education, and entrepreneurship. Thus, all pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   University/Institution                             Ranking/Accomplishment
1. IIT Madras                                        :   Topped NIRF Overall category in 2024
2. IISc Bangalore                                     :   Top-ranked Indian university in THE World University Rankings 2025
3. IIT Bombay                                       :   Top-ranked Indian institution in QS World University Rankings 2025
4. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham                       :   Top-ranked Indian University in THE University Impact Rankings 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

IIT Madras's top ranking in the overall NIRF category for 2024 is accurate. IIT Bombay's position as the top Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025 is also correct.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's top ranking among Indian universities in the THE University Impact Rankings 2024 is factual.  However, IISc Bangalore did *not* top the THE World University Rankings 2025; it was ranked within the 251-300 bracket. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair involving IISc Bangalore.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Ranking System                     Top Ranked Indian Institution (2024/2025)
1. QS World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Technology Delhi
2. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
3. University Impact Rankings 2024     : Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was indeed the top-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings 2024, achieving the 81st position.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While IIT Bombay was the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025 at 118, the question incorrectly states IIT Delhi.  The QS rankings fluctuate and different IITs often vie for top positions.  Including an incorrect IIT serves as a strong distractor.

Pair 2 is also incorrect.  The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 placed the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore in the 251-300 bracket, not as the top-ranked Indian institution. This highlights the difference between various ranking systems and their methodologies, a key UPSC-relevant concept.  The inclusion of IISc Bangalore, a highly reputable institution, makes this a plausible distractor for those unfamiliar with the precise ranking details.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between different ranking systems and their results.


**2. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

Regulation                                   Key Feature
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Requires foreign universities to be ranked in the global top 1000.
2. National Education Policy 2020         : Explicitly prohibits the establishment of foreign university campuses.
3. Letter of Intent (LoI) issued to the University of Southampton :  Marks the establishment of the second international university campus in India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).  The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023,  aims to facilitate the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities, a key feature mentioned in the provided text. The regulation sets a criterion for foreign universities to be ranked within the global top 500, either overall or in specific subject areas,  or possess exceptional expertise in a particular field.  This factual detail makes option (a) correct.

Option (b) is incorrect. The National Education Policy 2020, in fact, *envisages* the entry of foreign universities to provide an international dimension to higher education in India, directly contradicting the statement in the question.

Option (c) is incorrect. The LoI issued to the University of Southampton marks the establishment of the *first* international university campus in India under the 2023 regulations, not the second.  This is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's knowledge of current events and policy implementation.

Option (d) combines an incorrect and a correct statement, making it incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's ability to evaluate the accuracy of information and distinguish between correct and incorrect statements, a crucial skill for UPSC aspirants.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                    Funding Source/Key Partner
1. Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality : Primarily funded by the Indian Government.
2. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Funds entirely from private sources.
3. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) :  Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is a primary partner.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) receives funding from both the central government (₹14,000 crore) and private sources (₹36,000 crore) for the period 2023-2028.  However, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is explicitly mentioned as a supporter of the Alliance for Global Good, making this the key differentiating factor and the correct match.

Option (a) is incorrect.  The Alliance for Global Good has support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, among others, and is born out of the G20 Leaders’ Declaration, not solely funded by the Indian government.

Option (b) is incorrect. PM-JUGA utilizes funds from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes; it does not rely solely on private funding.

Option (d) combines an incorrect and a correct statement, thus making it incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's ability to analyze funding mechanisms of different initiatives and understand the roles of various stakeholders.  The nuanced differences in funding sources make this a challenging question that assesses both factual recall and analytical skills.



**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

Indicator                                     India's Status/Ranking
1. Overall Global Hunger Rank                     : 108th out of 193 countries
2. GHI Score                                      :  Falls under the "serious" category
3. Percentage of India's population suffering from undernourishment : 13.7%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). The GHI 2024 report placed India in the "serious" category of hunger, and the report indicates that 13.7% of India’s population suffers from undernourishment. These figures align with the information provided in the text.

Option (a) is incorrect because the overall global hunger rank for India in the GHI 2024 is reported as 105th out of 127 countries, not 108th out of 193.  The discrepancy in ranking and the number of countries included is a significant distractor designed to test the candidate's ability to recall precise figures.

Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes the incorrect first pair.

Option (d) is incorrect as it only includes the correct second pair.

The question assesses factual recall regarding the GHI 2024 report, specifically focusing on India's performance.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect data makes the question challenging and tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between slightly differing but ultimately incorrect information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Tribal Group/Initiative                           State/Region
1. Paudi Bhuyans                               : Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                      : Odisha
3.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Primarily focused on improving the conditions of Scheduled Castes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d).  None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Paudi Bhuyans are a tribal group residing in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. The Bharias are a tribal group found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is explicitly focused on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, not Scheduled Castes.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of tribal groups and their geographical distribution, as well as understanding of government schemes targeting specific communities.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings, especially with geographically close states, creates strong distractors.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Ministry/Organization
1. PMAY-U                                         :    Ministry of Rural Development
2. PMAY-G                                         :    Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
3.  Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS)       :    Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
4.  National Health Authority (NHA) scheme     :   Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana-Urban (PMAY-U) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, focusing on providing affordable housing to the urban poor.  Option 1 incorrectly assigns it to the Ministry of Rural Development. PMAY-Gramin (PMAY-G) is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, addressing housing needs in rural areas.  This makes option 2 correct.  The Credit Linked Subsidy Scheme (CLSS), a component of PMAY-U, is also correctly paired with the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs in option 3. Option 4 is incorrect; the NHA scheme mentioned in the source text is related to digitizing patient health records and is not under the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Funding Source
1.  GREAT scheme                               :   Central Assistance of ₹1.0 lakh
2.  Viability Gap Funding (VGF) scheme        :    Community Investment Fund (CIF)
3.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) :    Revolving Fund (RF) of ₹ 2,500 crore
4.  PM-JUGA                                     :   Existing DAPST grants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GREAT scheme, focused on technical textiles, offers grant-in-aid, but the amount mentioned in option 1 (₹1.0 lakh) is incorrect and relates to a different scheme (PMAY-U). Option 2 is correct; the VGF scheme for offshore wind energy doesn't use the Community Investment Fund (CIF) which is related to SHGs. Option 3 incorrectly links DAPST funding to the Revolving Fund for SHGs; DAPST funds are used for the PM-JUGA Abhiyan, making option 4 correct.  Thus, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                       Target Beneficiary/Group
1.  Krishi Sakhi                                  :   Adults aged 15 and above
2.  ULLAS-NILP                                  :   Rural Women
3.  Lakhpati Didi Initiative                       :    SHG members
4.  PM-JUGA                                     :  Tribal communities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Krishi Sakhi, part of the Lakhpati Didi program, targets rural women, making option 1 incorrect. ULLAS-NILP targets adults aged 15 and above, not rural women as stated in option 2. The Lakhpati Didi initiative correctly targets SHG members, making option 3 correct. PM-JUGA is designed to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, correctly represented in option 4.  Therefore, options 3 and 4 are the only correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Scheme                              Key Feature/Goal
1.  PM-JUGA                                     :   Digitizing patients' health records
2.  National Offshore Wind Energy Policy       :   Installation of 1 GW of offshore wind energy projects
3.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                    :   Providing pucca houses to eligible households
4.  PM Jan Arogya Yojana                       :   Increasing Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, not digitizing health records (option 1). The National Offshore Wind Energy Policy correctly aims at installing 1 GW of offshore wind energy projects (option 2). Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan focuses on improving education, not housing (option 3). PM Jan Arogya Yojana is a health insurance scheme, not related to increasing GER (option 4). Only option 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                  Objective/Feature
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA)                       :   Defining Pandemic emergency
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:   Accord Habitat Rights to PVTGs
3.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) : Promoting, protecting and ensuring full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities.
4.  National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016:   Providing supplementary nutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act (FRA) grants forest rights, including habitat rights, not related to defining pandemics (option 1). The IHR, 2005, deals with international public health emergencies, not habitat rights (option 2). The UN-CRPD correctly aims to promote the rights of persons with disabilities (option 3).  National Health Accounts Guidelines are for health expenditure tracking, not supplementary nutrition (option 4). Only option 3 is correctly matched.



**1. With reference to global hunger initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
    1. World Food Programme                      :   Established in 1961 under the aegis of the UN
    2. Rome Declaration on Nutrition             :   Focuses solely on eradicating hunger in Africa
    3. Zero Hunger Challenge                     :   Launched by the UN Secretary-General
    4. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty :   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is indeed a food assistance branch of the United Nations, established in 1961.  Its mission is to combat hunger worldwide.  The Zero Hunger Challenge is a UN Secretary-General's initiative aiming for universal access to adequate nutrition. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in 2024, aiming to eradicate hunger and poverty and reduce inequalities.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Rome Declaration on Nutrition's scope is broader than just Africa; it's a global commitment to eradicating hunger and malnutrition in all forms.  Option (c) is incorrect as it omits correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the factually inaccurate statement about the Rome Declaration.  The focus on specific organizations and initiatives and their accurate attributes makes this a challenging question for UPSC aspirants, demanding precise knowledge of global hunger-related programs.


**2. With reference to organizations combating malnutrition, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                              Location/Key Function
    1. GAIN                                  :   Headquartered in Rome, Italy
    2. UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) :   Primarily focuses on water resource management
    3. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN): Supports public-private partnerships for nutrition
    4. UNICEF                               :  Exclusively focuses on child immunization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) accurately supports public-private partnerships to improve nutrition.  The other options contain inaccuracies.  The FAO's mandate is much broader than just water resource management; it addresses various aspects of food and agriculture.  UNICEF's work encompasses a wide range of child health and welfare issues, not just immunization.  Finally, GAIN is headquartered in Switzerland, not Rome. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key organizations involved in nutrition and their specific areas of focus, making it a challenging question that necessitates detailed knowledge.


**3. With reference to reports on food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

    Report                                   Key Publisher/Focus
    1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024: Focuses solely on reducing food waste
    2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)  :  Published by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
    3. Food Waste Index Report 2024          :  Published by the World Bank
    4. The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains: Published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The other options include inaccuracies. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report has a broader focus than just food waste; it addresses various aspects of food security and nutrition. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a joint publication of UNEP and WRAP, not the World Bank. The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains report is published by GAIN, not UNEP. This question tests the candidate's awareness of different reports related to food security and their publishers, requiring knowledge beyond just the report titles.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to the Indian legal framework on women's safety:**

    Act/Judgment                          Key Provision
    1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013: Defines sexual harassment based on the Vishaka Judgment
    2. Justice Hema Committee Report       :  Deals specifically with the protection of women in the workplace
    3.  Alliance for Global Good            :  Focuses on women’s health, education, and enterprise
    4.  Global Gender Gap Report 2024     :  Benchmarking gender parity based on 14 indicators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act correctly defines sexual harassment aligning with the Vishaka Judgment.  The other options are not entirely accurate pairings. The Justice Hema Committee Report investigated sexual harassment, but its scope was not limited to the workplace. The Alliance for Global Good promotes gender equity, but it's not a legal framework. The Global Gender Gap Report is an assessment, not a legal provision.  The question requires understanding of Indian laws protecting women and their nuances, testing the candidate's knowledge of the legal framework and its connection to other initiatives.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

    Year/Organization                       Key Finding/Feature
    1. GHI 2024                            :  Published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
    2. 2022 GHI ranking for India         :  Ranked 108th out of 193 countries
    3.  GHI Methodology                     :  Focuses solely on child mortality rates
    4.  Top 3 GHI ranked countries 2024  : Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  The top three countries in the 2024 GHI ranking are correctly listed as Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland.  However, the other options contain inaccuracies. India's ranking in 2022 was different from that given in the option.  The GHI's methodology is multifaceted, not solely focused on child mortality.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the GHI report and its key features, including its methodology and the ranking of countries, which requires specific and detailed knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Focus Area
1.  PM-JUGA                               :  Improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India
2.  POSHAN Abhiyan                          :  Eradicating hunger and malnutrition in India
3.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty : Combating climate change impacts on food security
4.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition          :  Addressing micronutrient deficiencies in women and children globally
5.  Asmita Project                           :  Promoting multilingualism in Indian education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) is explicitly aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a flagship program focused on improving nutritional status and combating malnutrition, particularly among women and children. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating hunger and various forms of malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies. The Asmita Project is designed to promote multilingualism in education by providing high-quality study materials in various Indian languages.  Option (c) correctly matches all these initiatives with their respective focus areas. Option (3) is incorrect because the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, while related to food security, does not directly focus on climate change impacts as its primary goal. The alliance addresses broader issues of hunger, poverty, and inequality.  Options (a) and (b) are partially correct but omit crucial pairings, making them incomplete and inaccurate.  Option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of the Global Alliance with climate change.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)         :  Promoting the rapid deployment of solar energy globally
4.  World Health Organization (WHO)           :  Determining policies and supervising financial aspects of global health
5.  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO):  Ensuring accurate surveying and charting of the world's waters



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is the food assistance branch of the United Nations, primarily focused on combating global hunger. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) aims to promote the rapid and massive deployment of solar energy. The World Health Organization (WHO) serves as the decision-making body, setting policies and overseeing financial aspects of global health initiatives. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of navigation and protection of the marine environment by accurately surveying and charting the world's waters.  Option (b) correctly matches these organizations with their primary functions. Option (2) is incorrect because FAO’s function is not related to university rankings. Options (a) and (c) are partially correct, but omit significant pairings, making them incomplete. Option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of FAO with university ranking functions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                   Objective

4.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Facilitating the entry of top-ranked foreign universities into India
5.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :  Combating doping in sports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NFSA, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food. Amendments to the IHR, 2005, aim to enhance global public health preparedness and response. The UGC regulations of 2023 facilitate the establishment of foreign university campuses in India. Option (a) accurately reflects the objectives of these acts and regulations. Option (1) is incorrect as UN-CRPD focuses on disability rights, not multilingual education. Option (5) is also incorrect because the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act is unrelated to combating doping in sports; that falls under the purview of other regulations and conventions. Options (b), (c), and (d) include these incorrect pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Ranking/Framework                                  Key Feature

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings utilize nine performance indicators. The University Impact Rankings assess universities based on their contribution to UN SDGs.  NIRF uses five parameters to rank Indian institutions. THE World University Rankings employ 18 indicators across five key areas. ANRF aims to boost research and innovation in India. Option (b) accurately reflects the key features of these ranking systems and frameworks.  All pairs are correctly matched; therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Project/Initiative                              Implementing Agency/Organization
1.  Project NAMAN                               :  Indian Army
2.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                       :  Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS)

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN is an Indian Army initiative. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is implemented by Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti. SPARSH is a system under the Ministry of Defence. PAIR is a program under ANRF.  The Play True Campaign is led by NADA. Option (b) accurately links each project or initiative with its correct implementing agency or organization. Option (3) is incorrect because while SPARSH is related to Project NAMAN, Project NAMAN itself is an Indian Army initiative, not directly the Ministry of Defence.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting correct pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Implementing Ministry
1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna          :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
2. Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) :   Ministry of Rural Development
3.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)  :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
4.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                     :   Ministry of Education
5.  National Health Mission                       :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  This scheme provides financial assistance to pregnant women and lactating mothers for their nutritional needs and healthcare.  The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Rural Development, focusing on empowering women through Self Help Groups (SHGs).  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a crucial initiative of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Finally, the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, a comprehensive program for school education, is implemented by the Ministry of Education.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision/Focus
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Provisions related to individual forest rights
2. National Food Security Act, 2013             :   Recognizes the right to food as a legal entitlement
3.  Right to Education Act, 2009                :   Free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14

5.  National ECCE Policy, 2013                   :   Guidelines for early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, grants forest rights to eligible tribal communities, including individual forest rights.  The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally establishes the right to food for a significant portion of the Indian population. The Right to Education Act, 2009, mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 includes a sub-framework for early childhood care and education (ECCE) extending to children aged 0-3 years.  The National ECCE Policy, 2013, provides a framework for ECCE primarily focusing on the 3-6 age group.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                                 Primary Goal
1.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                       :   Providing pucca houses to eligible tribal households
2.  Jal Jeevan Mission                              :   Ensuring access to tap water connections
3.  PM Gram Sadak Yojana                           :   All-weather road connectivity to tribal villages
4.  Bharat Net                                     :   Providing mobile and internet connectivity
5.  Ayushman Bharat Card (PM Jan Arogya Yojana)   :   Providing affordable healthcare access

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) aims to provide pucca houses to eligible rural households, including tribal families. The Jal Jeevan Mission focuses on providing safe and adequate drinking water through tap connections to every rural household.  PM Gram Sadak Yojana strives to improve rural connectivity through all-weather roads, benefiting tribal villages. Bharat Net is a national initiative to expand broadband internet access across the country, including remote areas with tribal populations. The Ayushman Bharat Card (PM Jan Arogya Yojana) provides access to affordable healthcare services.  Therefore, all five pairs correctly match the program/initiative with its primary goal.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                     Organization/Body
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                 :   Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
2. Food Waste Index Report 2024                   :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)
4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)           :   Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
5.  The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains :   Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a collaborative effort between UNEP and WRAP. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains report is published by GAIN. However, the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is primarily published by several UN agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO,  not solely by FAO. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Only option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                                    State/Region
1.  Juangs                                         :   Odisha
2.  Bharias                                        :   Madhya Pradesh
3.  Kamars                                          :   Chhattisgarh
4.  Maria Gond                                      :   Maharashtra
5.  Paudi Bhuyans                                  :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Juangs are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) primarily residing in Odisha. The Bharias are a tribal community found in Madhya Pradesh.  The Kamars are a tribal group in Chhattisgarh. The Maria Gond are a tribal community located in Maharashtra.  The Paudi Bhuyans are another PVTG found in Odisha. All five pairs correctly match the tribe or community with its primary region. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                     Key Feature/Provision
1.  National Anti-Doping Act, 2022             :   Established the National Anti-Doping Agency as a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860
2.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 : Allows abortion up to 24 weeks under certain conditions
3.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Prohibits surrogacy involving donor gametes
4.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allows surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medical conditions certified by a District Medical Board.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect the key features of the respective Acts and Rules. The MTP Act, 1971,  initially permitted abortions up to 20 weeks, with extensions under specific circumstances.  The 2021 amendment extended this limit to 24 weeks for certain categories of women.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, significantly changed the 2022 rules by allowing surrogacy with donor gametes (sperm or eggs) when medically necessary and certified by a District Medical Board, unlike the previous prohibition.

Option (a) is incorrect as the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) was initially established as a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, not as a statutory body; this was changed by the 2022 Act. Option (b) is incorrect because, although pair 2 is correct, pair 3 is incorrect. The ART Act aimed to regulate ART services but did not initially prohibit surrogacy with donor gametes; this restriction was part of the initial Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022, later amended in 2024. Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies in pairs 1 and 3 as explained above.  The question tests factual knowledge of specific legislation and their amendments, requiring detailed understanding of Indian healthcare and legal frameworks.


**2. With reference to healthcare financing in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Expenditure Type                       Trend in 2021-22 (compared to 2017-18)
1.  Total Health Expenditure (THE) as % of GDP : Decreased
2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as % of THE : Increased
3.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as % of THE : Increased
4.  Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as % of THE : Decreased


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) increased from 40.8% in 2017-18 to 48% in 2021-22.  The other statements are incorrect.  Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, not decreased. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased, not increased. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE increased, not decreased.  The question assesses the ability to recall and analyze data related to healthcare financing trends in India, highlighting the complexities of the Indian healthcare system and its funding mechanisms.  It requires precise understanding of the different expenditure categories and their relative changes over time.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Provision
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                  :   Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
2.  New Education Policy (NEP) 2020                :   Establishes the National Research Foundation (NRF)
3.  National Anti-Doping Act, 2022                :   Created a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of developing countries in managing pandemics
4.  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :  Introduces multiple exit options in undergraduate degrees.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs. The NEP 2020 indeed established the National Research Foundation (NRF).  Pair 3 is incorrect because the creation of a coordinating financial mechanism is related to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, not the National Anti-Doping Act. Pair 4 is incorrect; multiple exit options are a feature of the NEP 2020, not the IHR amendments. This question tests the understanding of various Indian policies and their key provisions, requiring knowledge across different sectors like forestry, education, and health. The inclusion of seemingly related but incorrect options makes it challenging, forcing candidates to accurately recall the specific features of each policy.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Objective
1. Tribal Home Stay                           :   To improve infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
2. Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) :  To tap the tourist potential in tribal areas
3.  Advance facilities for diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) : To enable tribal producers to get fair prices for their produce
4. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)     :   Special focus on FRA patta holders


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The objective of the Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC) is to help tribal producers get better prices for their products, reducing post-harvest losses, and making tribal produce more accessible to consumers. The scheme focused on assisting the 22 lakh FRA patta holders.  The other pairs are mismatched.  Tribal Home Stays aim to boost tourism in tribal areas, not improve school infrastructure.  The sustainable livelihood initiative for FRA holders focuses on improving their livelihoods, not just on patta holders.  Advance facilities for diagnosing Sickle Cell Disease are part of the scheme, but this is not the overall objective of the Sustainable Livelihoods initiative.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific government scheme, requiring detailed understanding of its components and objectives. The mismatched pairs act as effective distractors, demanding precise recall of the scheme's details.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Declaration                 Key Focus
1.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport : Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally
2.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Focuses on the full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities
3.  Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region : Aims to eliminate doping in sports through prevention and fight
4. Biwako Millennium Framework                 : Promotes a barrier-free and rights-based society for persons with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. The UNESCO Convention harmonizes anti-doping rules globally. The UN-CRPD promotes the rights of persons with disabilities. The Biwako Millennium Framework works towards an inclusive society for people with disabilities. Pair 3 is incorrect because the Declaration on Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region focuses on disability inclusion, not on anti-doping measures.  This question assesses knowledge of international treaties and declarations related to both sports and disability rights, demanding accurate recall of the focus of each instrument. The incorrect pairing acts as a significant distractor, requiring precise understanding of the specific goals of each treaty or declaration.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities
2.  Asmita Project                               :   Focuses on real-time translation architecture for education
3.  Project NAMAN                               :   Provides services to defence pensioners and veterans through SPARSH


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, is correctly paired with its primary objective: improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence and outreach of different schemes.  Option 1 is thus correct.

The Asmita Project aims to augment study materials in Indian languages through translation and academic writing.  While it involves the creation of a multilingual dictionary repository and the use of technology to enhance translation, its core focus is on providing high-quality study materials in native languages. Option 2 is therefore incorrectly matched with real-time translation architecture as the primary objective.  The real-time translation architecture is a component of a broader initiative to promote multilingualism in education, but is not the defining feature of Asmita.

Project NAMAN, launched by the Indian Army, accurately targets providing dedicated support and services to defence pensioners, veterans, and their families through the SPARSH system.  Option 3 is correctly matched.

Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Mandate/Activity
1.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty    :   Focuses solely on accelerating efforts to eradicate hunger
2.  World Food Programme                         :   Combats hunger worldwide by providing food aid and promoting food security
3.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)       :  Works exclusively on improving the efficiency of agricultural production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to support and accelerate efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty, while also addressing inequalities.  Its mandate is broader than just eradicating hunger; therefore, option 1 is incorrect.

The World Food Programme (WFP) accurately works to combat hunger worldwide through food aid, food security promotion, and nutritional enhancement.  This aligns perfectly with its stated mission. Option 2 is correct.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a significant role in improving food security and nutrition, but its activities extend beyond merely increasing agricultural production efficiency. It addresses various aspects of food systems, including sustainable agriculture, rural development, and environmental concerns. Option 3 is therefore incorrect.

Consequently, only pair 2 is correctly matched, leading to option (b) as the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                    Key Provision
1.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport : Harmonizes anti-doping legislation globally
2.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):  Focuses solely on employment rights for disabled persons
3.  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005:  Defines pandemic emergencies solely based on mortality rates


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport accurately aims to harmonize anti-doping legislation, regulations, and rules internationally to ensure a level playing field. This is a core provision of the convention. Option 1 is correct.

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) has a much broader scope than solely focusing on employment rights. It promotes, protects, and ensures the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, encompassing various aspects of their lives, including education, healthcare, and social inclusion. Option 2 is incorrect.

The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, define pandemic emergencies based on a communicable disease's wide geographical spread or high risk of such spread, and its exceeding or potential exceeding of national health systems' response capabilities.  Mortality rates are a factor to consider, but not the sole criterion. Option 3 is incorrect.

Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Primary Goal
1.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013        :   To provide free food grains to all citizens
2.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana          :  To enhance maternal and child health through financial assistance
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission)   :   To improve agricultural productivity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, aims to provide subsidized food grains to a significant portion of the population, not free food grains to all citizens.  Option 1 is incorrect.

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) accurately provides financial assistance to registered pregnant women and lactating mothers for wage support and nutritious food, directly contributing to improved maternal and child health. Option 2 is correct.

POSHAN Abhiyan, the National Nutrition Mission, focuses on improving nutritional status and reducing malnutrition among children and pregnant women.  It does not primarily aim to improve agricultural productivity, although improved agricultural practices can indirectly support its goals.  Option 3 is incorrect.

Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, resulting in option (b) being the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Key Finding/Focus
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024              :   India's ranking improved significantly, indicating substantial progress in reducing hunger
2.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:  Highlights the adequate financing to end hunger globally
3.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :  Tracks food waste only at the household level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 shows that India's ranking improved, but it does not indicate substantial progress in reducing hunger.  The improvement is relative and the level of hunger in India remains a concern. Option 1 is incorrect.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, correctly focuses on the financing needed to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. This is a central theme of the report. Option 2 is correct.

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels (household and food service), not solely at the household level. Option 3 is incorrect.

Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.


**1. With reference to global food security initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                     Key Initiative/Report

    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a key partner in the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), which produces the annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with WRAP, publishes the Food Waste Index Report, making pair 2 correct. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) did indeed release the report, ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’, thus pair 3 is also correct.  However, the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is an initiative of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India, not the World Food Programme (WFP). This makes pair 4 incorrect.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair 4.


**2. With reference to reports on global hunger and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

    Report                                          Key Finding/Organization

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report does indeed focus on financing mechanisms to combat hunger and malnutrition, making pair 1 correct. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is accurately attributed to Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, validating pair 2.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 correctly tracks global food waste at the retail and consumer levels, confirming pair 3. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is also correctly described as ranking countries based on gender parity across four key dimensions, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3.  With reference to organizations working on food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Mandate/Focus
    1. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) :  Tackles malnutrition through public-private partnerships.
    2. FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)       :  Produces the Global Report on Food Crises.
    3. WFP (World Food Programme)                   :  Launched the NQAS assessment initiative.
    4. UNICEF (UN International Children's Emergency Fund) : Primarily focuses on child health and well-being


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN's focus on tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships is accurately described, making pair 1 correct. The FAO's role in producing the Global Report on Food Crises is also accurate, making pair 2 correct.  However, the NQAS assessment initiative is a project of the Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the WFP, making pair 3 incorrect. UNICEF's focus on child health and well-being is accurate, making pair 4 correct.  Option (b) is the only option that correctly identifies all the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                   Custodian Organization
    1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                         :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
    2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                         :   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    3. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)                :   World Economic Forum (WEF)
    4. Gender Inequality Index (GII)                 :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Loss Index (FLI) is indeed under the custodianship of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not UNEP, making pair 1 incorrect. The Food Waste Index (FWI) is correctly associated with UNEP, making pair 2 correct. The World Economic Forum (WEF) is the correct custodian for the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), making pair 3 correct.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is the correct custodian of the Gender Inequality Index (GII), making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Indian government initiatives on nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature/Target Group
    1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor.
    2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana           : Provides financial assistance to registered pregnant women.
    3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0             : Aims to bridge the nutritional gap for children and pregnant women.
    4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013       : Recognizes the right to food as a legal entitlement.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PMGKAY's provision of free food grains to a large section of the poor population is accurately described, making pair 1 correct.  PMMVY's financial assistance to registered pregnant women is also accurate, making pair 2 correct. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 correctly aim to bridge the nutritional gap, making pair 3 correct.  The NFSA, 2013, correctly recognizes the right to food, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                            :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                   :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                    :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                               :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                           :   Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the pairs mentioning Kamars (Chhattisgarh) and Maria Gond (Maharashtra) are accurately matched.  The other pairs contain incorrect state attributions.  The Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias reside in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Finally, the Dongria Kondhs are an indigenous tribe of Odisha, not Gujarat.  This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India.  Understanding the location of these tribes is crucial for comprehending their unique socio-economic contexts and the challenges they face. The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge, as the incorrect options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate pairings of tribes and states.  The question requires precise knowledge and highlights the importance of detailed understanding of Indian tribal demographics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   PVTG Characteristic                         Description
1.  Forest-based livelihoods                 :   Agriculture-based economy
2.  Pre-agricultural level of existence     :   Reliance on hunting and gathering
3.  Stagnant and declining population       :   Rapid population growth
4.  Extremely low literacy                    :   High literacy rates
5.  Subsistence economy                     :   Modern industrial economy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) because pairs 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect the characteristics used to identify Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  Forest-based livelihoods (1) directly relate to their traditional dependence on forest resources. Pre-agricultural level of existence (2) signifies their reliance on hunting and gathering rather than agricultural practices.  A subsistence economy (5) means they produce just enough to meet their basic needs.  The distractors (options a, b, and c) present contrasting descriptions for each characteristic, aiming to test the candidate’s precise understanding of the criteria for identifying PVTGs.  This question assesses conceptual understanding and requires an in-depth knowledge of the defining features of PVTGs. The incorrect options utilize opposite or unrelated terms to create plausible but incorrect matches, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge about PVTG identification criteria.


**3. With reference to the ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature                           Description
1.  Aim                                      :   Assimilation into mainstream society
2.  Funding                                  :   State-level funding only
3.  Financial Assistance                     :   Primarily for infrastructure development
4.  Approach                                 :   Top-down planning approach
5.  Activities Supported                    :  Exclusively focuses on housing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched, which is the pair related to the scheme’s aim.  The scheme aims at comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving their culture and heritage; this is fundamentally different from assimilation. The other pairs are incorrect. The scheme receives 100% central assistance, not just state-level funding. The financial assistance is broader than just infrastructure; it includes education, housing, agriculture, and social security. The approach is a micro-plan based on CCD plans, not a top-down approach.  Finally, the activities supported are much more diverse than just housing. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of the nuances of the PVTG development scheme, requiring detailed factual recall and the ability to discern subtle differences in descriptions. The incorrect options provide plausible yet inaccurate descriptions, highlighting the need for precise knowledge about the scheme’s features.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Mission Component                        Description
1.  Objective                              :   Focuses solely on skill development
2.  Funding                                  :   Entirely from new budgetary allocations
3.  Tenure                                  :   2 years
4.  Coverage                                :   Limited to 10,000 villages
5.  Implementing Ministries                 :   Solely the Ministry of Tribal Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The PM-JUGA's objective encompasses a broader range of improvements beyond just skill development. Its funding comes from existing DAPST grants, not solely new allocations. The scheme's tenure is 5 years, not 2. The coverage extends to around 63,000 villages, not just 10,000. Finally, multiple line ministries, not just Tribal Affairs, are involved in implementation. This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the PM-JUGA scheme.  The incorrect options offer plausible but factually incorrect descriptions, highlighting the necessity for precise knowledge regarding the scheme's various components.  The difficulty stems from requiring precise knowledge of the scheme's parameters.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                    Primary Goal
1.  PMGKAY                                  :   Improve maternal health
2.  PMMVY                                   :   Provide free food grains
3.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    :   Bridge nutritional gaps
4.  NFSA, 2013                              :   Ensure skill development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) aims to provide free food grains, not improve maternal health (that's PMMVY's focus).  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) provides financial assistance to pregnant and lactating mothers, supporting their nutrition and health.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition to address nutritional deficiencies. The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, aims to ensure food security, not skill development. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various Indian government schemes focused on nutrition and food security. The incorrect options are designed to test the precise knowledge of the goals of each scheme, making the question challenging.  The question also subtly tests understanding of the distinctions between different but related schemes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                       Ministry/Organization
1. PM-SHRI Schools                      :   Ministry of Education
2. Swadesh Darshan                       :   Ministry of Tourism
3. National Health Mission                 :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4. Skill India Mission                    :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
5. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)              :   Ministry of Rural Development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  PM-SHRI schools fall under the Ministry of Education's purview for school infrastructure development. Swadesh Darshan, a central sector scheme, is implemented by the Ministry of Tourism to promote tourism in India. The National Health Mission is a flagship program of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare focusing on improving health outcomes. Skill India Mission,  aimed at skill development and entrepreneurship, is under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship.  Finally, PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin),  a rural housing scheme, is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                           Key Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Defines 'habitat' as the area comprising customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups.
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871               :   Notified certain communities as 'born criminals'.
3. Environment Protection Act, 1986       :   Regulates Eco-Sensitive Zones (ESZs).
4. Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972         :   Provides legal protection to Indian elephants by listing it in Schedule I.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, explicitly defines the term 'habitat' in relation to the rights of tribal communities. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, a notorious piece of colonial legislation, categorized certain communities as inherently criminal. The Environment Protection Act, 1986, provides the legal framework for regulating Eco-Sensitive Zones. The Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, grants the highest level of protection to Indian elephants under Schedule I. Thus, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched according to the provided information.  India's ranking in the GHI 2024 is accurately stated as 105th out of 127 countries. The global average GHI score is indeed classified as moderate in terms of hunger severity.  The report also indicates that the number of countries facing alarming hunger levels surpasses 40. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to initiatives to combat hunger, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Description
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :   Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor.
2. World Food Programme                       :   Food assistance branch of the United Nations.
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition              :   Commits countries to eradicate hunger and malnutrition.

All four pairs are correctly matched. The NIRF is indeed a ranking framework implemented by the Ministry of Education in India.  The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings are published by Times Higher Education.  QS World University Rankings are published by Quacquarelli Symonds.  Finally, the University Impact Rankings are also published by Times Higher Education.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as it includes all the correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                      Organization/Agency
1. Food Waste Index Report 2024                      :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)               :   Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:   Five UN specialized agencies (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, WHO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is jointly published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP.  The Global Report on Food Crises is produced by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is indeed published by five UN specialized agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as it includes all the correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                          PVTG
1. Odisha                                      :   Juangs of Keonjhar
2. Madhya Pradesh                               :   Bharias
3. Chhattisgarh                                  :   Kamars
4. Maharashtra                                   :   Maria Gond


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Juangs of Keonjhar are identified as a PVTG in Odisha. Bharias are a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh. Kamars are a PVTG in Chhattisgarh.  Maria Gond is a PVTG in Maharashtra.  Therefore, option (d) is correct because it includes all the correctly matched pairs.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**8. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following:**

    Statement                                      Correctness
1. All nomadic tribes are DNTs.                 :   Incorrect
2. All DNTs are nomadic tribes.                 :   Incorrect
3. DNTs were notified as 'born criminals' during the British regime. :   Correct


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  The crucial distinction is that while all DNTs were nomadic or semi-nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. The British colonial government's Criminal Tribes Act wrongly labeled certain nomadic communities as inherently criminal, a stigma that continues to affect them. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the historical context and categorization of DNTs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect statements.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes the correct answer and a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                      State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                     Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                           Odisha
3. Kamars                            Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                        Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                    Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 3 and 4.  The Kamars are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) found in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond are a PVTG in Maharashtra.  Option (a) is incorrect because the Paudi Bhuyans are from Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Option (c) is partially correct regarding 3 and 4 but incorrectly includes the Dongria Kondhs.  The Dongria Kondhs are a PVTG found in Odisha, not Andhra Pradesh. Option (d) is incorrect as it only gets 4 correct and 2 is incorrect.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for comprehending the challenges of targeted development initiatives for these vulnerable communities.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills in identifying correct state-tribe pairings amidst plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature                       Correct Description
1. Funding Source                       100% State assistance
2. Implementation Approach            Top-down approach, centralized planning
3. Primary Objective                     Economic empowerment without cultural preservation
4.  Financial Assistance Provided For  Education, housing, agriculture, infrastructure development
5. Scheme Duration                      1 year


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  The scheme indeed provides financial assistance for education, housing, agriculture, and infrastructure development for PVTGs. Option 1 is incorrect; the scheme is centrally sponsored with 100% central assistance. Option 2 is incorrect because it uses a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans, which is a decentralized and participatory approach. Option 3 is incorrect as the scheme aims for comprehensive socio-economic development while preserving culture and heritage. Option 5 is incorrect; the scheme duration is 5 years, not 1. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of the scheme's design and implementation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Community and Habitat Rights        Correct Statement
1. Juangs of Keonjhar                      Received habitat rights
2. Mankidia tribes of Odisha                 Did not receive habitat rights
3. Bharias of Madhya Pradesh                Received habitat rights
4. Section 3(1)(e) of FRA                     Does not pertain to habitat rights
5.  Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006           Does not grant habitat rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Juangs of Keonjhar and the Bharias of Madhya Pradesh have received habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act.  Option (b) is partially correct, but it omits the correct matching of pair 3. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because statement 4 and 5 are false. Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA explicitly deals with habitat rights, and the FRA does grant these rights.  The question tests factual knowledge about the implementation of the Forest Rights Act and its provisions related to PVTGs.


**4. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                      Correct Description
1.  Named After                         Birsa Munda
2. Primary Objective                    Improving only the health infrastructure of tribal communities
3. Funding Source                        Entirely from newly allocated funds
4. Key Approach                         Convergence of existing schemes
5.  Based on learnings from              PM-KISAN


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The scheme is named after Birsa Munda, and a key approach is the convergence of existing schemes to address multiple needs. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect.  The scheme's objective is broader than just health infrastructure and utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not entirely new funds. The scheme is based on the learnings from PM-JANMAN, not PM-KISAN.  This question assesses knowledge of the PM-JUGA scheme and its design principles.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Global Index/Report                 Key Finding Related to India
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024       India ranked in the "moderate" category of hunger severity
2.  NIRF 2024                           IIT Madras topped overall category for the 6th consecutive time
3.  QS World University Rankings 2025   IISc Bangalore is the top-ranked Indian university
4.  State of Food Security and Nutrition  India's child wasting and stunting rates are very low
5. Times Higher Education Rankings 2025   IISc Bangalore ranked in the top 250 globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The NIRF 2024 rankings indeed show IIT Madras topping the overall category, and QS World University Rankings 2025 place IISc Bangalore as the top-ranked Indian university (though not necessarily in the top 250 globally, the statement is true for the top rank in India).  Option 1 is incorrect because India is ranked in the "serious" category of hunger severity according to the GHI 2024. Option 4 is incorrect as India's child wasting and stunting rates are very high. Option 5 is partially correct but it should have mentioned that IISc Bangalore is ranked 251-300.  The question assesses factual recall regarding different ranking systems and their outcomes related to India.


**6.  With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                     Correct Description
1. Adoption Year                                2008
2. Objective                                     To promote respect for inherent dignity of persons with disabilities
3. Number of Signatories (including India)     Less than 100
4.  Theme of 17th Session                      “Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future”
5. Key Focus Area                                 Environmental Sustainability


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The UN-CRPD's objective includes promoting respect for the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities, and the 17th session's theme is indeed as stated. Option 1 is incorrect; the convention was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008. Option 3 is incorrect; there are more than 164 signatories. Option 5 is incorrect; environmental sustainability is not a primary focus area of the UN-CRPD, although inclusivity might indirectly relate to it. The question tests factual knowledge about the UN-CRPD, its aims, and recent developments.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                            Description
1.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 : Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right
2. PMGKAY                                  Provides food grains free of cost to 80 crore poor
3.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana : Provides Rs. 5000 to registered women on birth of first child
4. POSHAN Abhiyan                         Aims to improve maternal and child nutrition
5. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021       Allows only commercial surrogacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. PMGKAY provides free food grains, PMMVY gives financial assistance to women, and POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on maternal and child nutrition.  Option (b) is incorrect as NFSA recognizes the right to food as a statutory right, not a fundamental right. Option (c) is incorrect because the Surrogacy Act allows only altruistic surrogacy. Option (d) is partially correct but omits the correct matching of pair 3. The question tests knowledge of various government schemes and acts related to food security and nutrition.  It also evaluates the ability to differentiate between statutory and fundamental rights.


**8. With reference to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Community                      Example
1. Hunter/trappers                       Chenchus
2. Pastoral communities                   Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups                     Pardis
4. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)              All nomadic tribes are DNTs
5.  Habitual Offenders Act                 Recommended for immediate repeal by the Idate Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Chenchus are an example of hunter-gatherer communities, Pardis are peripatetic groups, and the Idate Commission recommended repealing the Habitual Offenders Act. Option (b) is partially correct, omitting the correct matching of pair 5. Option (c) is incorrect; Konda Reddis are hunter-gatherers, not pastoral communities, and not all nomadic tribes are DNTs. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the false statement that all nomadic tribes are DNTs. This question assesses knowledge of different types of nomadic communities and relevant legal frameworks.  It demands careful analysis of the nuances within the categories.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) Related                     Correct Description
1. Aadharshila                                    National Curriculum for ECCE for children aged 3-6 years
2. Curriculum Duration                              48 weeks
3.  Target Age Group                                0-3 years
4. Key Learning Methodology                         Rote learning and memorization techniques
5. Implementing Ministry                           Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Aadharshila is indeed a national curriculum for children aged 3-6, and its duration is 48 weeks. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Options (b) and (d) are incorrect. The target age group is 3-6 years, not 0-3 years, and the curriculum emphasizes play-based learning, not rote learning. The implementing ministry is the Ministry of Women and Child Development, not the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This question assesses knowledge of the Aadharshila curriculum and its features, demanding precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                         Focus Area
1. PM-JUGA                               :  Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
2. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)              :  Providing pucca houses with tapped water and electricity
3. National Health Mission                 :  Coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units
4. Skill India Mission                      :  Marketing support through Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) explicitly aims to improve the infrastructure of government residential schools and hostels for tribal communities, aligning perfectly with pair 1.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is a rural housing scheme focused on providing pucca houses with access to basic amenities like water and electricity, making pair 2 correct. The National Health Mission (NHM) utilizes mobile medical units to expand immunization coverage in remote areas, thus validating pair 3.  However, pair 4 is incorrect. While Skill India Mission contributes to skill development, the marketing support through Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) is a component of PM-JUGA, not Skill India Mission directly. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                    Ranking Category
1. IIT Madras                                  : Overall Category
2. IISC Bangalore                              : Universities Category
3. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham                : University Impact Rankings
4. Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore: Times Higher Education World University Rankings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IIT Madras consistently topped the Overall category in NIRF rankings for several years, including 2024. IISC Bangalore similarly held the top spot in the Universities category for multiple years, including 2024.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's high ranking in the Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings 2024 is accurately reflected in pair 3.  Finally, IISc Bangalore’s placement in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025, though a different ranking system, still reflects its high global standing, making pair 4 correct. All four pairs accurately represent the rankings of these institutions in the specified categories.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                   Organization/Custodian
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024              : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
2. Food Waste Index Report 2024               : UN Environment Programme (UNEP) with WRAP
3. Global Gender Gap Report 2024              : United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
4. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024: Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, making pair 1 correct. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a collaborative effort between UNEP and WRAP, validating pair 2.  However, pair 3 is incorrect; the Global Gender Gap Report is released by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not UNDP.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; while the FAO is significantly involved in food security and nutrition issues, the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is a joint publication of multiple UN agencies, not solely the FAO.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to  initiatives aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Tribal Home Stay                             :  Ministry of Tourism initiative under Swadesh Darshan
2. Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA):  Focus on 22 lakh FRA patta holders
3. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC):  Set up to minimize post-harvest losses
4.  Advance facilities for diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD): Establishment of Centers of Competence in AIIMS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Tribal Home Stay initiative under PM-JUGA is indeed promoted by the Ministry of Tourism as part of the Swadesh Darshan scheme, making pair 1 correct.  The Sustainable Livelihood component of PM-JUGA explicitly focuses on supporting 22 lakh FRA patta holders, validating pair 2.  TMMCs are designed to help tribal producers get better prices for their produce and reduce post-harvest losses, making pair 3 accurate.  The establishment of Centers of Competence for Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis in AIIMS and other leading institutions is also a key feature of PM-JUGA, confirming pair 4. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Convention/Framework        Key objective/feature
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) : Adopted in 2006, entered into force in 2008
2. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport: Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally
3. Biwako Millennium Framework             : Works towards an inclusive, barrier-free society
4.  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report: Promotes nutrition investments to reduce gender inequalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD's adoption and entry into force dates are accurately stated in pair 1.  The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport does indeed aim to harmonize anti-doping rules globally, making pair 2 correct. The Biwako Millennium Framework for Action on an Inclusive, Barrier-Free and Rights-Based Society is accurately described in pair 3.  The GAIN report's focus on nutrition investments to mitigate gender inequalities is also correctly stated in pair 4. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                         Custodian Organization
1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                         :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Food Waste Index Report (FWI)                 :   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)         :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Loss Index (FLI) is indeed tracked by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the World Food Programme (WFP).  WFP is involved in addressing food crises, but FLI's focus is on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Food Waste Index Report (FWI) is correctly paired with the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is accurately linked to the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  The GRFC is produced annually by FSIN, which is a crucial aspect of understanding global food security.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies in addressing global food security challenges is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                       Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) NQAS Assessment :  Ministry of Rural Development
2. Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) NQAS Assessment : Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3. Spot Food License Initiative                    :  Ministry of Commerce and Industry

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) falls under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. This is because these initiatives directly relate to public health infrastructure and service delivery.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect as AAMs are not under the Ministry of Rural Development.  The Spot Food License Initiative is implemented through a pan-India IT platform, primarily related to food safety and regulation, which is also under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect. The question tests the knowledge of government schemes and their associated ministries, a key area in the UPSC exam.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                         Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                :   India ranked 1st in South Asia
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022            :   India ranked 108th out of 193 countries
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Focus on financing to end malnutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly reflects India's ranking of 129th out of 146 countries, not 1st in South Asia.  Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and Bhutan were ranked higher than India in South Asia.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 accurately reflects India's ranking at 108th out of 193 countries. This shows India's position relative to other nations on gender equality.  Statement 2 is correct. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 correctly highlights the focus on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  Statement 3 is correct. The question assesses the understanding of global development reports and their key findings, which is relevant for the UPSC exam.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Policy                                 Key Feature/Objective
1. National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024            :   Focuses solely on Global Sporting Excellence
2. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education :   Integrates informal learning into formal education system
3.  Project NAMAN                               :   Aims to provide support to Defence Pensioners only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 has a broader vision than solely focusing on global sporting excellence. It encompasses economic, social, and community development aspects related to sports.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education accurately aims to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system.  This is a crucial aspect of making education more inclusive and accessible. Statement 2 is correct. Project NAMAN aims to provide support to Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families, not solely pensioners. Hence, statement 3 is incorrect.  The question assesses the understanding of recent policy initiatives in sports and education, areas frequently covered in the UPSC exam.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Key Provision
1.  India Post Office Act of 1854                   :   Established the office of the Director General of Post
2. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985:  Focuses on anti-doping measures in sports
3. National Anti-Doping Act, 2022                :   Established NADA as a statutory body


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The India Post Office Act of 1854 correctly established the office of the Director General of Post, centralizing postal services under one authority.  Statement 1 is correct. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with narcotic control, not anti-doping measures in sports.  That falls under the purview of the National Anti-Doping Act, 2022. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The National Anti-Doping Act, 2022 correctly established the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) as a statutory body, strengthening the anti-doping framework in India. Statement 3 is correct. The question tests the knowledge of Indian legislation and its key provisions, an essential part of the UPSC syllabus.


**1. With reference to Science and Technology initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was established under the ANRF Act 2023, effectively absorbing the previous Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB). Project NAMAN, a significant initiative by the Indian Army, leverages the SPARSH system to provide comprehensive support to defence pensioners and veterans.  The ASMITA Project, aligned with the New Education Policy 2020, focuses on making quality educational materials accessible in various Indian languages. Finally, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) employs a multi-faceted approach to rank educational institutions, using parameters encompassing teaching, learning, research, and outreach.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a system designed to formally acknowledge skills and knowledge acquired outside traditional educational settings, thus integrating informal learning into the formal system. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) provides a digital platform for storing academic credits earned from different institutions, promoting flexibility in higher education. The National Educational Technology Forum (NETF), a key component of NEP 2020, facilitates the use of technology in education. Finally, the National Research Foundation (NRF) plays a crucial role in boosting research and innovation across the country.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is jointly published by Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welthungerhilfe (Germany). The QS World University Rankings are produced by Quacquarelli Symonds. The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings are published by Times Higher Education. Finally, the India Rankings are released by the Ministry of Education, Government of India.  Therefore, option (d) correctly identifies all the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.



**4. With reference to Government Schemes and Initiatives related to Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the features and objectives of the mentioned schemes and initiatives. The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a comprehensive program aimed at uplifting the socio-economic status of tribal communities.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan (PM-JANMAN) served as a foundational model for the PM-JUGA initiative.  The Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) is the primary source of funding for PM-JUGA. Lastly, the Forest Rights Act (FRA) is a critical legislation that provides habitat rights to PVTGs.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

The Biwako Millennium Framework is a significant initiative focused on creating a more inclusive and accessible society for people with disabilities. The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region is directly related to the broader objectives of the UN-CRPD. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD indeed had the theme "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future".  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, reflecting the accurate matching of all pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only the pairing of ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) with its key feature of establishing world-class research centers is accurate.  PAIR's core function is to pair universities for mentorship, not specifically focus on EV mobility and solar cells research, although these are areas *potentially* covered under the program's broader scope. MAHA's aim is to support solution-focused research in priority areas, which includes, but is not limited to,  EV mobility and solar cells.  The question uses specific, potentially misleading details within the distractors (PAIR and MAHA) to test the candidate's precise understanding of ANRF's initiatives and avoid superficial comprehension.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrect pairings based on partial or inaccurate interpretations of the initiatives' descriptions. The question effectively tests the ability to distinguish between the core objectives and the potential applications of the ANRF initiatives.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1. Year of Adoption                             : 2008
2. Number of Signatories (including India)       : 164
3. Theme of the 17th Conference of State Parties :  "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because the UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, making statement 1 incorrect.  However, statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The convention has 164 signatories, including India, and the 17th Conference of State Parties indeed focused on the theme mentioned.  The question tests detailed knowledge about the UN-CRPD, including its adoption and entry into force dates and the specifics of a recent conference. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the inaccurate information about the year of adoption. The question effectively tests the ability to recall precise details and differentiate between adoption and entry into force.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, and its duration is five years (2024-2029). However, while PM Awaas Yojana is relevant to housing components within PM-JUGA, the primary funding source comes from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the scheme's namesake, timeline, and funding mechanisms, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the source of funds to avoid superficial understanding. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the primary funding source.  The question effectively tests the ability to differentiate between related but distinct funding streams within a government program.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                 Ranking Category

All three pairs are correctly matched. IIT Madras topped the Overall category in NIRF 2024, IISC Bangalore topped the Universities category, and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings 2024. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the top-ranked institutions in various categories of the NIRF and other global rankings. All other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question effectively tests recall of specific ranking details from multiple ranking frameworks.


**5. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

   University                                  Key Feature
1. University of Southampton                 : First international university to set up a campus in India under UGC Regulations, 2023
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023  : Requires foreign universities to be ranked in global top 500
3. National Education Policy 2020           : Facilitates the entry of higher-ranked Foreign Universities to open campuses in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The University of Southampton was the first to receive a Letter of Intent under the new UGC regulations.  The regulations themselves stipulate a top 500 global ranking as a criterion, and the National Education Policy 2020 envisioned and supported the entry of top global universities to set up campuses in India. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the policy context, regulations, and the first instance of their implementation. All other options are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question effectively tests the interconnectedness of policy, regulation, and practical implementation.



**6. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail

* **Option (a) 1 only:** Bharias are a PVTG, but they reside in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Odisha has several PVTGs, including the Juangs and Saora.  This option mixes up the state-PVTG pairings.

* **Option (c) 2 and 4 only:** This option incorrectly pairs Juangs with Madhya Pradesh and Saora with Maharashtra.  While both Juangs and Saora are PVTGs, their locations are incorrect in this pairing. Juangs are primarily found in Odisha, and Saora are found in Odisha.

* **Option (d) 3 and 4 only:** This option is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Saora with Maharashtra.

The question is designed to be challenging by including plausible but incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the geographical distribution of PVTGs in India.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 1, 3, and 4 only.  PM-JUGA aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Let's examine the pairs:

* **Pair 1:**  The establishment of TMMCs directly contributes to developing enabling infrastructure by providing market access for tribal producers. This is a correct match.

* **Pair 2:** Providing access to Ayushman Bharat cards falls under healthcare, not economic empowerment within the framework of PM-JUGA, which focuses on skill development and entrepreneurship. This is an incorrect match.

* **Pair 3:** Upgrading residential schools and hostels is a direct intervention aimed at improving access to education. This is a correct match.

* **Pair 4:** Ensuring road connectivity is a key component of infrastructure development.  This is a correct match.

The incorrect pairing (Pair 2) acts as a strong distractor, requiring careful understanding of the specific goals and interventions under PM-JUGA.  The question tests the candidate's ability to discern the precise relationship between the goals and the specified interventions.

3. Community Forest Rights                 :   Cover customary access to water bodies
4.  Individual Forest Rights               :   Cover the right to protect, regenerate, or conserve or manage any community forest resource

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 2, 3, and 4 only. The FRA, 2006, grants several forest rights to forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes and other traditional forest dwellers.  Let's examine each pair:

* **Pair 1:** Habitat rights are not granted to all Scheduled Tribes; they are specifically granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other eligible groups based on their traditional dependence on forest areas. This is incorrect.

* **Pair 2:** Individual forest rights do indeed relate to the use of non-timber forest produce, such as fruits, leaves, and medicinal plants. This is correct.

* **Pair 3:** Community forest rights encompass customary access to various resources, including water bodies. This is correct.

* **Pair 4:**  This accurately describes a component of community forest rights.  This is correct.

The incorrect pairing (Pair 1) serves as a crucial distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the FRA's provisions. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nuances within the different types of forest rights granted by the Act.  It necessitates a detailed understanding beyond general awareness.

4. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as % of THE: Decreased

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 1, 2, and 4 only.  The NHA estimates track various aspects of healthcare financing in India.  Let's analyze the pairs:

* **Pair 1:**  The THE as a percentage of GDP has shown an increasing trend, not a decrease.  This is incorrect.

* **Pair 2:**  The GHE as a percentage of THE has indeed increased, indicating a greater government share in healthcare financing. This is correct.

* **Pair 3:** The CHE as a percentage of THE has shown a decreasing trend, not an increase. This reflects a shift in expenditure patterns.  This is incorrect.

* **Pair 4:** The OOPE as a percentage of THE has decreased, indicating a reduction in the burden of out-of-pocket healthcare expenses on households. This is correct.

The incorrect pairings (Pairs 1 and 3) act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's ability to recall the specific trends observed in the NHA estimates.  The question goes beyond simple knowledge; it requires precise recall of data trends.  This is a high-difficulty question.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 and 4 only. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracks food waste at various levels.  Let's analyze the pairs:

* **Pair 1:**  The Food Loss Index (FLI) is actually under the custodianship of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not UNEP. This is incorrect.

* **Pair 2:** The Food Waste Index (FWI) is under the custodianship of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), not FAO. This is incorrect.

* **Pair 3:**  This correctly links SDG 12.3.1 (a) with the FAO as the custodian agency for FLI. This is correct.

* **Pair 4:** This correctly links SDG 12.3.1 (b) with UNEP as the custodian agency for FWI. This is correct.

The incorrect pairings (Pairs 1 and 2) are designed to be plausible distractors, demanding precise knowledge of the agencies responsible for tracking these specific indicators. The question necessitates a high level of precision and detailed knowledge of the report's contents.

3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                           :   Launched by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, indeed focuses on financing mechanisms to eliminate hunger. The Global Report on Food Crises is annually published by the Food Security Information Network.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was jointly launched by UNEP and WRAP. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, failing to recognize the accurate pairings. Option (c) correctly identifies all three accurate matches, demonstrating an understanding of key reports and indices related to global food security and waste management.  Knowledge of these reports is essential for analyzing global food security challenges.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Provision/Feature
1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                            :   Declared certain communities as "born criminals"
2.  The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 :   Governs organ donation in India
3.  The Advocates Act, 1961                             :   Prescribes two classes of advocates: senior and other advocates
4.  Representation of the People Act, 1951              :   Lays down the Model Code of Conduct (MCC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is infamous for its discriminatory classification of certain communities. The Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994, is the primary legislation governing organ donation in India. The Advocates Act, 1961, distinguishes between senior and other advocates. The Representation of the People Act, 1951, incorporates the Model Code of Conduct for elections. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  Option (d) demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the key features of these important pieces of legislation across various domains, including criminal justice, healthcare, legal practice, and electoral processes.  Knowing these acts and their features is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the Indian legal framework.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Function/Characteristic
1. World Health Assembly (WHA)                 :   Supervises financial policies of WHO
2. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :   Successor to International Sanitary Regulations (1951)
3.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty  :   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in India
4. Food Security Information Network (FSIN)      :   Produces the Global Report on Food Crises annually


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO) and one of its key functions is to supervise the WHO's financial policies.  This makes pair 1 correct. The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, directly succeeded the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, establishing a legally binding framework for global public health emergencies. This makes pair 2 correct. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit in Brazil, not India, in 2024. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. The Food Security Information Network (FSIN) is responsible for producing the annual Global Report on Food Crises, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                    Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in 63,000 villages
2.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right
3.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                :   Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under Section 3(1)(e)
4.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition                   :   Aims to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition worldwide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, covering approximately 63,000 villages. The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs under Section 3(1)(e). The Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                          Description
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency                     :   Communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capacity
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism :   Addresses needs of developing countries in pandemic responses
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities               :   Improves coordination among countries in implementing the IHR
4.  States Parties Committee                         :    Focuses on improving the quality of healthcare facilities in developing countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, included a precise definition of pandemic emergencies as communicable diseases with a wide geographical spread that exceeds national health system response capabilities.  A coordinating financial mechanism was established to assist developing countries.  The creation of national IHR authorities aimed at improving coordination among nations.  However, the States Parties Committee focuses on effective IHR implementation, not specifically on healthcare facility quality.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4.  With reference to the  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Goal                                              Specific Initiative/Program
1. Developing Enabling Infrastructure                :   PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) for pucca houses
2. Promotion of Economic Empowerment              :   Skill India Mission for training
3. Universalization of Access to Education           :   Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan for quality education
4. Healthy Lives and Dignified Ageing              :  Establishment of  National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to develop enabling infrastructure through initiatives like PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) for housing, promote economic empowerment by providing skill development through Skill India Mission, and universalize access to quality education through Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.  However, the establishment of NHATS is related to National Health Accounts, not directly a component of PM-JUGA's goals.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                    Key Finding/Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                  :   Released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                   :   Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels
4. Global Report on Food Crises                     :   Produced by the World Health Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 was indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2024 focused on financing to end hunger and malnutrition. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracked food waste at retail and consumer levels. However, the Global Report on Food Crises is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not the WHO.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                           State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                 :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                        :   Odisha
3. Kamars                         :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                     :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                 :   Gujarat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) found in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond tribe is located in Maharashtra. The other pairs are incorrect.  Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Finally, Dongria Kondhs reside in Odisha, not Gujarat.  This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India, a crucial aspect of understanding India's diverse social landscape and the implementation of government schemes targeting PVTGs. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options like Gujarat for Dongria Kondhs and Madhya Pradesh for Paudi Bhuyans adds to the question's difficulty.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                           Primary Focus
1. PMGKAY                         :   Providing free healthcare to tribal communities
2. PM Matru Vandana Yojana        :   Providing financial assistance for education of tribal children
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0:   Improving maternal and child nutrition
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 :   Ensuring affordable housing for tribal families


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 primarily focuses on improving maternal and child nutrition.  PMGKAY is a food security scheme, not a healthcare initiative.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance to pregnant women and lactating mothers, not specifically for the education of tribal children.  The National Food Security Act aims to provide subsidized food grains, not housing. The question tests knowledge of government schemes in India and their specific objectives, requiring a nuanced understanding of their implementation.  The incorrect options include plausible but inaccurate associations of schemes with unrelated objectives, demanding careful evaluation and precise recall of scheme details.



**3. With reference to PVTGs, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for identifying PVTGs       Description
1. Forest-based livelihoods           :   Majority of the population engaged in non-agricultural activities
2. Pre-agriculture level of existence  :   Subsistence economy primarily dependent on hunting and gathering
3. Stagnant and declining population    :   High population growth rate
4. Extremely low literacy              :   High literacy rate among women
5. Subsistence economy                 :   High per capita income


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched.  Pair 2 accurately reflects a criterion for identifying PVTGs:  a pre-agricultural level of existence is characterized by a subsistence economy heavily reliant on hunting and gathering. The other pairs are incorrect:  Forest-based livelihoods don't necessarily exclude non-agricultural activities; a stagnant or declining population exhibits low growth, not high growth; extremely low literacy indicates low, not high, literacy rates; and a subsistence economy is associated with low, not high, per capita income. This question assesses the conceptual understanding of the criteria used to identify PVTGs.  The distractors present plausible, but incorrect, descriptions, demanding careful evaluation and precise recall of the defining characteristics of PVTGs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   University Ranking                  Institution
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025   :   Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
2. University Impact Rankings 2024    :   IIT Bombay
3. World University Rankings 2025     :   IISC Bangalore
4. NIRF 2024                          :   IIT Madras


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) Only one
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched:  IIT Madras topped the overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings.  The other pairs are incorrect. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian University in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not the QS rankings. IIT Bombay was not the top-ranked Indian institution in the University Impact Rankings 2024 and IISc Bangalore was the top-ranked Indian University in the World University Rankings 2025, not the University Impact Rankings 2024. This question tests factual recall of university rankings and the institutions achieving top positions in different ranking systems, requiring knowledge of multiple ranking frameworks.  The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate pairings of institutions with ranking systems, demanding precise recall and careful evaluation of ranking data.


**5. With reference to the  'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of the Scheme                     Description
1. Aim                                   :   Promoting tourism in tribal areas
2. Funding                                 :   50% Central, 50% State assistance
3. Financial Assistance Provided For     :   Setting up of large-scale industries in tribal areas
4. Approach                               :   Macro-level planning


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The aim of the scheme is comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture and heritage, not promoting tourism. The scheme receives 100% central assistance, not a 50/50 split. Financial assistance supports activities like education, housing, and agricultural development, focusing on community-level improvements, not large-scale industries. The scheme utilizes a micro-plan approach through CCD plans, not macro-level planning. This question tests detailed understanding of a specific government scheme, requiring precise recall of its objectives, funding mechanisms, and implementation strategy.  The incorrect options offer plausible but inaccurate descriptions of the scheme's aspects, demanding careful evaluation and precise knowledge of the scheme's details.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Focus Area
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) :  EV Mobility
2.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas)     : Solar Cell Technology
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)                    : Mentorship for Nascent Research Universities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PAIR explicitly focuses on pairing universities with established institutions for mentorship,  making option 3 incorrect. MAHA, or Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas,  supports research in priority areas including EV mobility and solar cells.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  PAIR, while encompassing broader innovation, is particularly mentioned in conjunction with accelerated innovation. Therefore, pair 1 is also correctly matched. The ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) aims to create world-class research centers, a different focus from the other two initiatives.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific mandates of each ANRF initiative is crucial for correctly answering this question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Key Function/Objective
1.  Concern Worldwide                            :   Released the Global Hunger Index 2024
2.  Welthungerhilfe                              :   Part of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
3.  National Board of Accreditation (NBA)        :   Implements the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe are the organizations that jointly released the Global Hunger Index 2024.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.  Welthungerhilfe is not directly part of the UN-CRPD's operational structure; that convention has a broader array of member states and organizations involved.  The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) collaborates with INFLIBNET Centre in the implementation of the NIRF rankings, not the sole implementer. Thus, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international and national organizations and their roles in specific initiatives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                 Core Provision/Aim
1.  ANRF Act 2023                               :   Establishes the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:   Facilitates the establishment of foreign university campuses in India
3.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :   Defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF Act 2023 establishes the Anusandhan National Research Foundation, not the NIRF. The NIRF is a separate initiative under the Ministry of Education. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The UGC regulations of 2023 are designed to allow foreign universities to set up campuses in India, making pair 2 correct. The IHR amendments, as described, define a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and the capacity of national health systems, making pair 3 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests knowledge of different acts and regulations pertaining to education and public health in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                    Primary Goal
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
2.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)     :   Provide free food grains to the poor
3.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013                 :   Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right
4.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme:  Improve access to quality health facilities for Scheduled Tribes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, PMGKAY provides free food grains, and the NFSA legally recognizes the right to food.  These three pairs are correctly matched. However, the PVTGs scheme focuses on comprehensive socio-economic development, including education, housing, and agriculture, not solely on healthcare access. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched ones.  This question assesses understanding of various Indian government schemes aimed at poverty alleviation and tribal welfare.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking System                                     Key Feature/Publisher
1.  NIRF 2024                                      :   Includes rankings for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities
2.  Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 :   Top-ranked Indian University is IIT Bombay
3.  QS World University Rankings 2025               :   Uses 9 performance indicators

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

NIRF 2024 rankings included new categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities, making pair 1 correct.  The QS World University Rankings use 9 performance indicators, making pair 3 correct.  However, in the THE World University Rankings 2025, IISc Bangalore is the top-ranked Indian University, not IIT Bombay. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.  This question tests awareness of different global and national university ranking systems and their methodologies.



**1. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   **Ministry/Scheme**                         **Associated Goal**
1. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                 :   Skill Development
2. Skill India Mission                         :   Pucca house for eligible households
3. National Health Mission                    :   Improving village infrastructure
4. PM Gram Sadak Yojana                      :   Enhanced Livelihood (self-employment)
5. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC) :   Universalization of access to education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through convergence of various schemes. The National Health Mission focuses on improving health infrastructure in villages, aligning with Goal 4 of PM-JUGA.  Similarly, the establishment of Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) directly supports the goal of economic empowerment (Goal 2) by providing marketing support to tribal producers.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is linked to providing pucca houses, not skill development. Skill India Mission is associated with skill development and livelihood enhancement, not housing. PM Gram Sadak Yojana aims to improve road connectivity, a part of infrastructural improvement (Goal 1), not livelihood enhancement.


**2. With reference to the Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   **State**                                     **PVTG Present**
1. Odisha                                     :   Bharias
2. Madhya Pradesh                             :   Juangs
3. Chhattisgarh                               :   Kamars
4. Maharashtra                                :   Paudi Bhuyans
5. Jharkhand                                  :   Saora tribals

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because the passage explicitly mentions that Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh have Kamars and Bharias respectively as PVTGs. Odisha is mentioned as having multiple PVTGs, including Juangs, but also other tribes.  The other options are incorrect.  Madhya Pradesh does not have Juangs as a PVTG; this tribe is found in Odisha. Similarly, Paudi Bhuyans are listed in Odisha, not Maharashtra.  Saora tribals are found in Odisha, not Jharkhand.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024:**

   **Country/Region**                          **GHI-related Data/Feature**
1. India                                      :   Ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2. Global Average                             :   GHI score of 27.3
3.  India's Undernourishment Percentage      :   13.7%
4. Global GHI Score                          :   18.3
5. Child Wasting in India (under 5)           :   35.5%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because India's ranking (105th out of 127) and the global GHI score (18.3) are correctly paired according to the provided text.  The other options contain mismatched data.  The global average GHI score is not 27.3; that figure is for India. India's undernourishment percentage is 13.7%, not 35.5%; that is the percentage of stunted children under five. The child wasting percentage in India is 18.7%, not 35.5%.


**4. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   **Document/Framework**                     **Associated Feature**
1. Biwako Millennium Framework               :   Focuses on the full participation of people with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region
2. UN-CRPD                                   :   Adopted in 2008 and entered into force in 2006
3. Declaration on the Full Participation...  :   Aims to promote respect for the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities
4. 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to UN-CRPD :  Theme: “Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture”
5. UN-CRPD                                   :  Has 164 signatories including India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d).  The Declaration on Full Participation is correctly linked to promoting respect for the inherent dignity of persons with disabilities. The 17th session's theme is accurately stated.  The UN-CRPD having 164 signatories, including India, is also correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to factual errors. The Biwako Millennium Framework's focus is not specifically on the Asia-Pacific region as stated; the provided text does not explicitly state this. The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, not vice versa.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to the  PM-JUGA's components:**

   **Component**                                  **Specific Objective/Focus**
1. Tribal Home Stay                             :   Upgradation of Government residential schools
2. Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) :   Focus on 22 lakh FRA patta holders
3. Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels :   Tapping tourist potential
4. Advance facilities for diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) :   Setting up 100 TMMCs
5. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC) :   Improving diagnosis of SCD


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The Sustainable Livelihoods component under PM-JUGA specifically focuses on supporting 22 lakh FRA patta holders.  The initiative to improve the infrastructure of government residential schools and hostels is mentioned as a specific component of the scheme. Option (a) is incorrect because Tribal Home Stays are focused on tapping tourist potential, not school upgradation. Option (b) is incorrect because TMMCs aim to improve marketing for tribal produce, not SCD diagnosis. Option (d) is incorrect as only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (c) correctly pairs the Sustainable Livelihoods component with its focus on FRA patta holders and the school infrastructure improvement initiative with its objective.



**1. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                 Ranking Category
    1. IIT Madras                               : Open Universities
    2. IISC Bangalore                           : Universities
    3. INFLIBNET Centre                         : Skill Universities
    4. National Board of Accreditation (NBA) : Overall Category

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 2 is correctly matched.  IISC Bangalore consistently tops the Universities category in the NIRF rankings.  The other pairs are incorrect. IIT Madras consistently tops the Overall category, not the Open Universities category.  The INFLIBNET Centre is a collaborating agency in the NIRF framework, not a ranked institution in any specific category.  Similarly, the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is the implementing agency, not a ranked entity in the Overall category.  The question tests factual recall of key institutions and their respective ranking categories within the NIRF framework.  Distractors are designed to confuse candidates by presenting plausible but incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the NIRF structure and participating institutions.


**2. With reference to Global University Rankings, consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking Organization                          Key Indicator/Feature
    1. Times Higher Education (THE)             : Based on 9 Performance Indicators
    2. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)               : Includes 18 indicators across five key areas
    3. Times Higher Education (THE) Impact     : Identifies universities excelling across multiple UN SDGs
    4. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) World         : Includes 2,092 ranked universities from 115 countries

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. QS World University Rankings utilizes 9 performance indicators, while THE World University Rankings use 18 indicators across five key areas.  The THE Impact Rankings specifically focus on universities' performance across various UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The QS World University Rankings includes universities from numerous countries, as stated. This question tests knowledge of different global university ranking systems and their methodologies.  Distractors involve switching key features between ranking organizations and introducing irrelevant or partially correct information, demanding careful evaluation of each pairing.


**3. Considering Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Policy/Initiative                                    Key Feature
    1. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020         :  Excludes multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees.
    2. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Restricts entry of top 500 globally ranked universities.
    3. Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                :  A digital platform for storing academic credits.
    4. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)          :  Mechanism to evaluate existing knowledge, skills, and experience.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) as only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is indeed a digital platform designed to store academic credits earned from various institutions.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) accurately describes a formal mechanism for evaluating prior knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways.  The other pairs are incorrect. NEP 2020 explicitly includes multiple exit options for undergraduate degrees.  The UGC regulations aim to *facilitate* the entry of top-ranked foreign universities, not restrict it. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of key policies and initiatives shaping higher education in India and their specific features.  Distractors involve presenting opposite or partially true statements, demanding precise knowledge and careful analysis.


**4. With reference to Tribal Development Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                      Key Feature/Objective
    1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Focuses exclusively on providing pucca houses.
    2. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan          : Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
    3. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)        :  Established to minimize post-harvest losses and facilitate fair pricing.
    4.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST)  :  Provides funding exclusively for skill development programs.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. PM-JUGA aims for holistic improvement of tribal communities’ socio-economic conditions, not limited to housing alone.  TMMCs are indeed established to reduce post-harvest losses and ensure fair prices for tribal produce.  The other pairs are incorrect.  DAPST funding is not limited to skill development; it encompasses various development initiatives for Scheduled Tribes.  The question tests knowledge of various government schemes and initiatives targeted at tribal communities in India.  Distractors involve oversimplifying the objectives of the schemes and creating misleading links between funding sources and specific programs, demanding a thorough understanding of the programs' scope.


**5. With reference to Health Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Report                                    Key Feature/Finding
    1. National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS-5)       :  Released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
    2. National Health Accounts Estimates              :  Offers a detailed description of financial flows within India’s health system.
    3. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)    :  Launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL).
    4. Food Waste Index Report 2024                   : Tracks global and national generation of food waste at retail and consumer levels.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) Only three
    (d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) as all four pairs are correctly matched. NFHS-5 reports are indeed released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  National Health Accounts Estimates provide a comprehensive financial overview of India's health system.  NQAS assessments are implemented for AAMs and IPHLs.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 focuses on tracking food waste at retail and consumer levels. This question evaluates understanding of various health-related initiatives and reports in India.  The distractors are designed to be plausible through general knowledge about health-related organizations and reports, demanding precise knowledge of the specific initiatives mentioned.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities.
2. Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) :  Includes the "Lakhpati Didi" initiative to increase women's income.
3.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                 : Provides pucca houses for eligible households under PM-JUGA.
4.  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) : Focuses on research in areas like EV mobility and solar cells.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA's core objective is to address critical infrastructural deficiencies and socio-economic challenges faced by tribal communities through convergent schemes.  DAY-NRLM's "Lakhpati Didi" initiative is a direct component designed to empower women economically.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), as explicitly stated in the provided text, is integral to PM-JUGA's goal of providing pucca houses.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because MAHA, while a significant initiative, is unrelated to the other schemes listed; it focuses on research and development in specific high-impact areas, not directly on socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities or women's empowerment through SHGs, which are the central themes of the other three schemes. Option (b) and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**2. With reference to initiatives for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Provision
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) : Promotes the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights for PwDs.
2.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) : Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
3.  National Policy for PwDs 2006              : Includes provisions for 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions for PwDs.
4.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) : Aims to create a barrier-free environment for PwDs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD is an international treaty explicitly dedicated to the rights and inclusion of PwDs. The National Policy for PwDs 2006 incorporates provisions for reservation in education and employment,  and the Accessible India Campaign is a specific initiative to improve accessibility. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are accurately matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because, while the FRA addresses the rights of PVTGs, which may include PwDs, it is not exclusively or primarily focused on PwDs as a whole.  The FRA's primary concern is habitat rights within forest areas. Options (b) and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative                       Focus Area
1.  Aadharshila                                      Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)
2.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)            Higher Education
3.  National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG)         River rejuvenation and pollution control
4.  Project PARI                                   Public art promotion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Aadharshila is explicitly a national curriculum for ECCE. RPL is a system for recognizing prior learning in higher education. NMCG's mandate is the rejuvenation and cleaning of the Ganga river. Project PARI focuses on promoting public art.  All four pairs accurately reflect the focus area of each scheme. Therefore,  option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to tribal welfare schemes, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                       Funding Source
1. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants
2.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                    :  DAPST grants
3. Jiyo Parsi Scheme                            : Central Sector Scheme
4.  Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana      : State Budget of Maharashtra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA explicitly utilizes DAPST grants for funding. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), in the context of PM-JUGA, also draws funding from DAPST. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme is a centrally funded initiative. The Ladki Bahin Yojana is a state-level scheme funded from the Maharashtra state budget. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched in terms of their funding sources. Options (a), (b), and (c) are consequently incomplete and incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                       Ministry/Organization
1.  PM-WANI Scheme                                      : Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs
2.  National Quantum Mission                             : Department of Science & Technology
3.  Subhadra Scheme                                      : Ministry of Rural Development
4.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only the National Quantum Mission falls under the Department of Science & Technology and the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) falls under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Let's analyze the incorrect options:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect because PM-WANI is under the Department of Telecommunication, not the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs.  The Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs is primarily concerned with urban development and housing schemes.

* **Option (b):** Incorrect as this only includes the correctly matched pair of the National Quantum Mission and the Department of Science & Technology.  It omits the correct pairing of PM-JUGA.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect because the Subhadra scheme is a state-level initiative launched by the Odisha Chief Minister and is not directly under any central ministry. PM-WANI  is also incorrectly assigned.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                            Key Feature
1.  The Prohibition of Child Marriage (Himachal Pradesh Amendment) Bill, 2024 : Raised the minimum age of marriage for boys to 21
2.  National Food Security Act, 2013                     : Guarantees food security to all citizens
3.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 : Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, does grant habitat rights to PVTGs, and the National Food Security Act, 2013, aims to guarantee food security to a significant portion of the population.

* **Option (a):** Incorrect. The Himachal Pradesh Amendment Bill raised the minimum marriage age for *girls* to 21, not boys.

* **Option (c):** Incorrect. While statement 3 is correct, statement 2 is also correct.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Objective
1.  Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)             : Provides grants for post-harvest infrastructure development
2.  RESET Programme                                 : Exclusively for retired international sports medalists
3.  Project NAMAN                                      : Streamlines pension processes for defence pensioners and veterans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. Project NAMAN, launched by the Indian Army, is indeed designed to streamline pension processes for defence pensioners and veterans.  Let's examine why the other statements are incorrect:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect.  The AIF provides *interest subvention* on loans, not direct grants, for post-harvest infrastructure.

* **Option (b):** Incorrect. The RESET Programme is for retired sportspersons who have participated in *both* national and international events, not exclusively international medalists.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                      Focus Area
1.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                     : Tracks food waste at the production level only
2.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)                : Produced by the World Health Organization (WHO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, indeed focuses on financing mechanisms to combat hunger and malnutrition.  The other statements contain inaccuracies:

* **Option (a):** Incorrect. The Food Waste Index Report tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, not just production.

* **Option (c):** Incorrect.  The GRFC is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not the WHO.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect due to the inaccuracies in statements 1 and 3.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                            Implementing Agency/Ministry
1.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                           : Ministry of Rural Development
2.  Ayushman Bharat Card (PM Jan Arogya Yojana)       : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  PM Gram Sadak Yojana                               : Ministry of Tribal Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 2 are correct. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, and Ayushman Bharat (PM Jan Arogya Yojana) falls under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  Statement 3 is incorrect:

* **Option (b):** Incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of Ayushman Bharat.

* **Option (c):** Incorrect, as it omits the correct pairing of PM Awas Yojana.

* **Option (d):** Incorrect because PM Gram Sadak Yojana is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  The Ministry of Tribal Affairs focuses on the welfare of tribal communities, while PMGSY focuses on rural road connectivity.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking Agency                       Ranking Name
1. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)          :   University Impact Rankings 2024
2. Times Higher Education (THE)       :   QS World University Rankings, 2025
3. Ministry of Education, India         :   National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 is indeed released by the Ministry of Education, India.  Options 1 and 2 are incorrect because they misattribute the ranking names to the agencies.  Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) releases the QS World University Rankings, and Times Higher Education (THE) publishes the World University Rankings and the University Impact Rankings.  The question plays on the similarity of names and the involvement of multiple ranking agencies in higher education assessment to create plausible distractors.  Understanding the specific names of rankings released by each agency is crucial for accurate matching.  The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise knowledge in correctly associating ranking agencies with their specific publications.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    University                                   Ranking (2024/2025)
1. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) :  81st in University Impact Rankings
2. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham                 :  118th in QS World University Rankings
3. Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore :  251-300th in THE World University Rankings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of IISc Bangalore with its 251-300th rank in the THE World University Rankings is correct. IIT Bombay is ranked higher than 118th in various rankings; the provided rank is incorrect for IIT-B.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham's 81st rank is correctly attributed to the University Impact Rankings, but it's not associated with IIT-B. The question uses similar-sounding university names and ranking positions to confuse the candidate, testing their knowledge of specific rankings and institutions.  The incorrect options demonstrate the need for precise recall of university rankings and the ability to distinguish between different ranking systems (QS, THE, NIRF).

    Regulation/Act                                     Key Feature
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023  :   Requires foreign universities to be ranked in the global top 1000
2. National Education Policy 2020                      :   Facilitates the entry of top 500 foreign universities
3. National Anti-Doping Act, 2022                       :   Established the National Anti-Doping Agency as an autonomous body

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Education Policy 2020 does indeed aim to allow the entry of top foreign universities into India. The National Anti-Doping Act, 2022 correctly established the NADA as an autonomous body. However, the UGC regulation for foreign university campuses requires them to be ranked within the top 500 globally, not top 1000.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the specifics of educational policies and anti-doping regulations in India.  The incorrect option highlights the importance of precise knowledge of regulations and policies and the potential for misinterpreting the requirements.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                              Description
1.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)   :  Funding of ₹14,000 crore from private sources for 2023-2028
2.  Project NAMAN                                    :  Support for Defence Pensioners, Veterans, and their families
3.  ASMITA Project                                  :  Production of 22,000 books in 22 languages in 10 years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN accurately focuses on supporting defence pensioners, veterans, and their families.  The ANRF received ₹36,000 crore from private sources, not ₹14,000 crore, making statement 1 incorrect. The ASMITA project aims to produce 22,000 books in 5 years, not 10, making statement 3 incorrect.  This question tests knowledge of specific government initiatives and their features, requiring precise recall of funding amounts and timelines. The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise factual recall to avoid common errors.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Initiative/Policy                            Key Element

2.  Khelo India Scheme                                   :  Harmonization with NEP 2020
3.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education:  Assessment and certifications for informal learning

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) initiative accurately aims at assessing and certifying informal learning. The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 has a broader vision encompassing social and economic development aspects, not just global excellence.  The Khelo India Scheme is not directly tied to harmonization with NEP 2020, although there might be some overlap in objectives. This question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between the core tenets of different government policies and initiatives. The incorrect options highlight the importance of understanding the holistic nature of policies and avoiding oversimplification.

2. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) :  Mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in organizations with 5 or more employees
3. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013       :  Guarantees a minimum quantity of food grains to Below Poverty Line (BPL) families


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations of 2023 require FHEIs to be ranked in the global top 500, not top 100, making statement 1 incorrect. The POSH Act mandates ICCs in organizations with 10 or more employees, not 5, making statement 2 incorrect.  The NFSA does guarantee a minimum quantity of food grains to eligible households, making statement 3 correct.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests detailed knowledge of specific provisions within legislation. The distractors play on the common knowledge of these acts and subtly alter the details to create plausible but incorrect pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GRFC is published by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), which includes FAO and WFP, not UNEP, making statement 1 incorrect. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed published by UNEP and WRAP, making statement 2 incorrect. Statement 3 is correct; the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is jointly published by the five UN agencies listed.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of specific reports and their publishing bodies. The distractors involve organizations closely related to food security and nutrition, making the question challenging.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health Financing Category                     Percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) in 2024
1. Social Security Expenditure on health       : 9.0%
2. Private Health Insurance Expenditures      : 7.4%
3. External/Donor Funding for health          : 1.1%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) increased to 7.4% of THE and External/Donor Funding for health increased to 1.1% of THE.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  However, the text indicates that Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health *decreased* to 8.7% from 9.0%.  Thus, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because only pair 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect as it only includes pair 2 which is correct but misses pair 3, which is also correct. Option (d) is incorrect because two pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the ability to extract precise numerical data and match it accurately to the correct category, highlighting the importance of attention to detail in analyzing health sector financial data.  Understanding the different sources of health financing is crucial for policy analysis and resource allocation.

2.  Karnataka                               : First state to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity.
3.  Living Will                               : A verbal agreement outlining end-of-life care preferences.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly defines passive euthanasia as the withdrawal of life support in terminally ill patients, making pair 1 correct.  The text mentions Karnataka as the *second* state (after Kerala) to allow terminally ill patients to die with dignity, making pair 2 incorrect.  A living will is defined as a *written* document outlining end-of-life care preferences, not a verbal agreement, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect because only pair 1 is correctly matched. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes pair 2, which is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched. The question assesses the understanding of euthanasia terminology and the accuracy of information related to legal frameworks surrounding end-of-life care.  It highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of legal and medical terms in this sensitive area.

3. Food Waste Index Report 2024              : Tracks food waste at the production level only.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched as the text explicitly states the report's focus on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  Pair 2 is incorrectly matched because the GRFC is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not solely the WFP, although the WFP is involved in its production. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Food Waste Index Report tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, not just at the production level. Option (b) is incorrect as it includes pair 2, which is not fully accurate. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes pair 3, which is incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect as pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of key reports related to food security and nutrition, assessing the ability to identify the correct focus and producing organizations. It emphasizes the importance of understanding global initiatives and their respective roles in addressing food-related challenges.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, does indeed provide habitat rights to PVTGs, making pair 1 correct. However, the NQAS assessment is launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), not solely for AB-HWCs, making pair 2 incorrect. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, defines a child as a person below 18 years of age, not 16, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes pair 2 which is partially incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes pair 3, which is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because only one pair is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of various acts and their provisions, requiring precise understanding of legal definitions and program implementations.  It highlights the importance of understanding the specific details of legislation and its impact on different communities.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005      Outcome/Feature

2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism  : Aims to primarily benefit developed countries.
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities            :  Improves coordination among countries.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states that the amendment to the IHR defines a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a wide geographical spread or a high risk of one, making pair 1 correct.  A coordinating financial mechanism is established to address the needs of *developing* countries, not primarily developed countries, making pair 2 incorrect.  The creation of National IHR Authorities is intended to improve coordination among countries, making pair 3 correct. Option (a) is incorrect as it misses pair 3. Option (b) is incorrect as it includes pair 2, which is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  This question assesses understanding of the amendments to the IHR, requiring knowledge of specific details regarding pandemic preparedness and international cooperation.  It underscores the importance of understanding global health governance and its impact on national health systems.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

1. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)              :  Implementation of the anti-doping program in India.
2. National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA)           :  Coordinates anti-doping activities globally through ADAMS.
3. South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO) :  Operates the Program for Education and Awareness on Anti-Doping in Sports (PEADS).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) is responsible for implementing the anti-doping program in India, making pair 2 correct.  WADA coordinates global anti-doping activities through ADAMS, not NADA, making pair 1 incorrect.  NADA, not SARADO, operates PEADS, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (a) is incorrect because only pair 2 is correct. Option (c) is incorrect because only pair 2 is correct. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different organizations involved in combating doping in sports, requiring knowledge of their specific functions and initiatives.  It highlights the importance of understanding the international and national frameworks for anti-doping measures.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Act/Provision                           Provision Related To
1.  Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) :  Domestic violence and harassment faced by married women.
2. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, Sections 85 and 86 :  Marital rape.
3. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :  Termination of pregnancies beyond 24 weeks for any reason.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Section 498A of the IPC explicitly addresses domestic violence and harassment faced by married women, making pair 1 correct.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, addresses cruelty towards married women but does not specifically address marital rape as a separate offense, making pair 2 incorrect.  The MTP Act, 1971, as amended, allows termination of pregnancies up to 24 weeks under certain conditions, not for any reason beyond 24 weeks, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (b) is incorrect because it includes pair 2, which is factually incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes pair 3, which is factually incorrect. Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of legal provisions related to women's rights and reproductive health, requiring precise understanding of the scope and limitations of different laws. It highlights the importance of understanding the legal framework surrounding crucial social issues.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                         Headquarters
1. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) :   Lausanne, Switzerland
2. National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA):   New Delhi, India
3. South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO): Colombo, Sri Lanka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) is headquartered in Montreal, Canada, not Lausanne, Switzerland.  Lausanne was the location of the First World Conference on Doping in Sport, which led to WADA's creation, but it's not its headquarters.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) in India operates under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, and while its precise location might not be explicitly stated,  it functions primarily from New Delhi. Therefore, statement 2 is considered correct for the purpose of this question, acknowledging the ambiguity about the precise location. The location of SARADO is not explicitly stated in the provided text.  However, given the regional focus on South Asia, Colombo, Sri Lanka, is a plausible and commonly understood location for such an organization. Thus, statement 3 is considered correct for the sake of this question, acknowledging that it's an inference based on the organization's name and geographical context.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                  Key Feature
1. National Anti-Doping Act, 2022         :   Established NADA as a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860
2. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport:  Harmonizes anti-doping legislation globally but excludes India
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024:  Prohibits the use of donor gametes in surrogacy procedures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Anti-Doping Act of 2022 established NADA as a statutory body, not a registered society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860. NADA was initially set up as a registered society in 2005, but the 2022 Act changed its status. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport aims to harmonize anti-doping rules internationally, and India is a signatory and has ratified the convention. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, *explicitly allows* surrogacy with donor gametes under specific medically certified conditions, directly contradicting statement 3.  Therefore, only statement 1 is incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                      Description
1. ASMITA Project                        :   Focuses on promoting multilingualism in higher education only
2. Project NAMAN                           :   Provides services to defense pensioners exclusively through online platforms
3. SARTHIE 1.0 Initiative                 :   Aims to empower only Scheduled Castes through legal aid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ASMITA project aims to provide high-quality study materials in various Indian languages, encompassing a broader range than just higher education. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Project NAMAN utilizes Common Service Centres (CSCs) which are not exclusively online, providing in-person support to defense pensioners and their families. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The SARTHIE 1.0 initiative aims to empower various disadvantaged communities, including but not limited to Scheduled Castes,  through awareness and legal support.  Therefore, statement 3 is also incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Medical Term/Regimen                  Description
1. BPalM regimen                         :   A six-month treatment for multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB)
2. Passive Euthanasia                    :   Administered only by a physician with consent from next of kin
3.  Living Will                           :   A legal document allowing withholding of life-sustaining treatment, only valid with notary's signature


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The BPalM regimen is indeed a shorter, six-month treatment for MDR/RR-TB.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct. Passive euthanasia, while administered by a physician, requires more than just consent from the next of kin; it involves a complex process including medical boards and adherence to court directives.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. A living will can be attested by a notary or gazetted officer, but other forms of attestation are also permissible.  Therefore, statement 3 is incorrect. Only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                         Key Provision
1. Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021   :   Allows only commercial surrogacy
2. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021:   Aims to regulate ART clinics and banks
3. National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019:   Mandates the creation of a National Medical Register (NMR)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021, explicitly allows only *altruistic* surrogacy, prohibiting commercial surrogacy.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, accurately focuses on regulating ART clinics and banks. Therefore, statement 2 is correct. The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, indeed mandates the creation of the National Medical Register (NMR). Therefore, statement 3 is also correct.  Only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

    2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                             :   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    3. SDG 12.3.1 (b)                                    :   WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme)


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge of the organizations responsible for key food-related indices and Sustainable Development Goals.

* **Pair 1:** Incorrect.  The Food Loss Index (FLI) is under the custodianship of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not UNEP.

* **Pair 2:** Correct. The Food Waste Index (FWI) is indeed overseen by the UNEP.

* **Pair 3:** Incorrect.  SDG 12.3.1 (b), focusing on halving per capita global food waste, is under the custodianship of UNEP, not WRAP. While WRAP collaborates with UNEP on the FWI report, it is not the custodian.

The distractors utilize organizations closely associated with food security and sustainability initiatives, making it crucial for the candidate to possess precise knowledge of the responsibilities of each organization.  The question assesses factual recall and the understanding of international collaborations in addressing global food challenges.

    2. Madhya Pradesh                                     :   13
    3. Chhattisgarh                                        :   10

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The question assesses knowledge of the distribution of PVTGs across Indian states.

* **Pair 1:** Incorrect.  Odisha has 13 recognized PVTGs, not 7.

* **Pair 2:** Incorrect. The number of PVTGs in Madhya Pradesh is not specified in the provided text.

* **Pair 3:** Incorrect. The exact number of PVTGs in Chhattisgarh is not provided in the text.

The distractors use states known to have significant tribal populations, creating plausible, yet incorrect, matches. The question tests factual recall of specific numerical data related to PVTGs and their geographic distribution.  The lack of precise data for some states increases the question's difficulty.

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). The National Health Mission (NHM) significantly focuses on improving healthcare access, including for tribal communities.  The Skill India Mission aims to enhance skill development, and a significant portion of its initiatives targets tribal populations.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) centers on providing housing in rural areas, which often includes tribal settlements.  PM-JUGA focuses on the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities, not solely on urban development.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan aims at providing quality education at all levels, which includes tribal students, but it is not exclusively focused on higher education for them.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes in India and their respective targets, particularly concerning tribal welfare.  Distractors include schemes with overlapping but not identical objectives, testing the candidate's precision.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) residing in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond tribe is found in Maharashtra.  The other pairs present incorrect state associations.  Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a PVTG of Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  Finally, the Dongria Kondhs are located in Odisha, not Chhattisgarh. This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India, a crucial aspect of understanding India's diverse population and the challenges faced by its marginalized communities.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge, as they involve tribes and states closely geographically related but not precisely accurate.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs                 Description
1.  Forest-based livelihoods                      :   Primary occupation involving agriculture
2.  Pre-agricultural level of existence          :   Reliance on hunting and gathering
3.  Stagnant and declining population             :  High birth rate and low mortality rate
4.  Extremely low literacy                        :   High school graduation rates
5.  Subsistence economy                         :   High per capita income

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  Pair 2 correctly links "pre-agricultural level of existence" with the reliance on hunting and gathering, which is a characteristic of many PVTGs. Pair 4 correctly matches "extremely low literacy" with the reality of low educational attainment among these communities. The other pairs are incorrect. Pair 1 incorrectly associates forest-based livelihoods with agriculture, while PVTGs often rely on forest produce and non-agricultural activities. Pair 3 is wrong, as stagnant or declining populations are marked by low birth rates or high mortality rates, not the opposite. Pair 5 wrongly links a subsistence economy to high per capita income; subsistence economies are defined by low income levels.  This question tests the candidate's comprehension of the criteria used to identify PVTGs and their socioeconomic characteristics, requiring a detailed understanding beyond superficial knowledge.  The distractors are strategically placed to challenge candidates who may possess partial but incomplete knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                       Key Feature
1.  PMGKAY                                      :   Provides monetary assistance to pregnant women
2.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna      :   Supplies free food grains to the poor
3.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0          :   Bridges nutritional gaps through supplementary nutrition
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013    :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b).  Pair 3 accurately describes Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 as schemes aimed at addressing nutritional deficiencies through supplementary nutrition. Pair 4 correctly states that the NFSA, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food.  The other pairs are mismatched. PMGKAY (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) is associated with providing free food grains, not monetary assistance to pregnant women; that is the function of Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY).  PMMVY provides financial assistance, not food grains. This question requires candidates to differentiate between various Indian government schemes aimed at food security and nutritional improvement, testing their understanding of the specifics of each program. The distractors are carefully chosen to highlight the subtle differences between similar-sounding schemes.


**4. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following pairs:**

   Term                                          Definition
1.  Habitat                                       :   Land used for cultivation by tribal communities
2.  Habitat Rights                               :   Granted after consultation with only government officials
3.  PVTGs                                        :   Groups exclusively residing in urban areas
4.  Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans    :   Strategies focusing solely on economic development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) None
(c) 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b).  None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The FRA defines "habitat" as the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests used by primitive tribal groups, pre-agricultural communities, and other forest-dwelling scheduled tribes. Habitat rights are granted after consultation with stakeholders, including tribal communities and government officials. PVTGs are tribal groups in vulnerable situations, not exclusively urban dwellers. CCD plans aim at balancing conservation and development.   This question tests the candidate's understanding of key definitions and processes within the FRA, requiring careful attention to detail.  All the distractors are designed to challenge candidates' knowledge of the act, demanding a deep understanding rather than superficial recall.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Focus Area
1. GAIN                                          :  Tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships
2. UNICEF                                        :  Promoting education exclusively
3. FAO                                           :  Improving sanitation primarily
4. World Food Programme (WFP)                   :  Providing food assistance globally
5. UN Women                                     :  Addressing gender inequality in agriculture only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a).  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) focuses on tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships, aligning with pair 1. The World Food Programme (WFP) is known for its global food assistance programs, making pair 4 correct. The other pairs are incorrect oversimplifications of the organizations' mandates. UNICEF's focus extends beyond education to encompass various child-related issues. FAO's work covers food security, agriculture, and rural development, not just sanitation. UN Women's initiatives address many aspects of gender equality, not just agriculture. This question demands precise knowledge of the mandates of international organizations working in the realm of food security, nutrition, and development, testing the candidate's analytical ability to discern the core focus of each organization from a set of plausible but partially incorrect options.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                     Country/Institution
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024, Top Rank :   Iceland
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024, India's Rank :  129th out of 146
3.  World University Rankings 2025, Top Indian University : Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore
4.  QS World University Rankings 2025, Top Indian Institution : Indian Institute of Technology Bombay
5.  Global Hunger Index 2022, India's Rank : 108th out of 193

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 indeed ranks Iceland as the top country.  India's ranking in the same report is accurately reflected as 129th out of 146 countries.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 correctly identifies the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) as the top-ranked Indian institution. However, the World University Rankings 2025 places the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, within the 251-300th rank bracket, not as the top-ranked Indian university. The Global Hunger Index 2022 data is also slightly inaccurate, as India's rank was actually 108th out of 193 countries. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the rankings of IISc, Bangalore and the GHI 2022. Only option (c) correctly identifies the accurate pairings.  It is crucial to note the specific ranking details and the subtle variations between different ranking systems and their methodologies to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy in analysis.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                      Publishing Organization/Agency
1. Global Gender Gap Report                         :  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)                     : World Economic Forum (WEF)
3.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                    :  UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP
4.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report : Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
5. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) : Ministry of Education, India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed a collaborative effort between the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) along with other UN agencies. The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is a ranking system implemented by the Ministry of Education, India.  However, the Global Gender Gap Report is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP, and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) is published by the UNDP, not the WEF.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to these mismatches.  Option (d) accurately matches the publishing organizations/agencies with the respective reports/indices. This question highlights the importance of understanding the sources and publishers of various reports and indices to avoid making incorrect associations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation/Initiative                          Key Feature/Objective
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 :  Defines sexual harassment based on Vishaka Judgment
2. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013      :  Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right
3.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) Act 2023 :  Seeks to foster research and innovation nationwide
4.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Permits foreign universities ranked in global top 500 to set up campuses in India
5.  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :  Defines pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act correctly defines sexual harassment in line with the Vishaka judgment. The ANRF Act aims to promote research and innovation. The UGC regulations allow top-ranked foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The IHR amendments define a pandemic emergency based on geographical spread and national health system capacity.  However, The NFSA recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect. Only option (d) accurately reflects the key features and objectives of the acts, regulations, and initiatives listed. This question tests the understanding of specific legislative and policy details, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of legal frameworks and their implementations.  The distinction between fundamental and statutory rights is a key aspect of Indian constitutional law that needs careful consideration.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                       Key Activity/Focus Area
1.  World Economic Forum (WEF)                          :  Publishing the Global Gender Gap Report
2.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)          :  Publishing the Gender Inequality Index
3.  World Health Organization (WHO)                       :  Implementing the International Health Regulations
4.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)               :  Producing the Global Report on Food Crises
5.  Alliance for Global Good                             :  Focuses on gender equity and equality

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The WEF publishes the Global Gender Gap Report. The UNDP publishes the Gender Inequality Index. The WHO is responsible for implementing the International Health Regulations. The FAO is involved in producing the Global Report on Food Crises, often in collaboration with other organizations. The Alliance for Global Good explicitly aims to promote gender equity and equality.  All the pairings presented are accurate and reflect the core activities and focus areas of the respective international organizations and initiatives.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  This question assesses the knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of major international organizations in addressing global issues.  Understanding the mandates of these bodies is crucial for analyzing global cooperation and development initiatives.


**1. With reference to Euthanasia and related legal pronouncements in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Case                                       Legal Outcome
1. Aruna Shanbaug v. Union of India (2011) :   Recognized the legality of active euthanasia.
2. Common Cause v. Union of India (2018)   :   Upheld the legal validity of passive euthanasia, linking it to Article 21.
3.  2023 Supreme Court Judgement          :   Further restricted the guidelines for passive euthanasia.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) was a landmark judgment where the Supreme Court of India, for the first time, recognized the legality of passive euthanasia,  allowing the withdrawal of life support under specific, stringent conditions.  It did *not* legalize active euthanasia, which involves actively taking steps to end a life.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Common Cause case (2018) further solidified the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution and upheld the legal validity of passive euthanasia, reiterating the need for strict guidelines.  This makes pair 2 correct.

In 2023, the Supreme Court modified the guidelines related to living wills and the withholding/withdrawing of life-sustaining treatment, clarifying procedures and strengthening safeguards. This modification did not overturn the legality of passive euthanasia but rather refined the process. Thus, pair 3 is also correct.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of pairs 2 and 3.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) and related initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Primary Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :   Provision of supplementary nutrition to address malnutrition.
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana     :   Financial assistance and nutritious food for pregnant women.
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0       :   Free food grains distribution to the poor.
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013:   Legal right to food.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is a program focused on providing free food grains to a large segment of the poor population.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) aims to provide financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers, thus correctly matching pair 2.

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are initiatives focused on providing supplementary nutrition to children and pregnant women to combat malnutrition, making pair 3 incorrectly matched.

The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right in India. This makes pair 4 correctly matched.  Hence, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3.  With reference to  amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                  Objective
1. Defining Pandemic Emergency                :   Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.
2. Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism  :   Improving coordination among countries through National IHR Authorities.
3. Creating National IHR Authorities          :   Addressing the needs and priorities of developing countries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, aimed at strengthening global health security.  The definition of a pandemic emergency was clarified to include a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding national health system capacities.  This does not match the objective described in pair 1.

A coordinating financial mechanism was established to help developing countries better respond to public health emergencies. This does not match the objective in pair 2.

National IHR authorities were created to improve coordination and response capabilities within individual countries.  This does not match the objective in pair 3.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Category                                  Top-Ranked Institution (2024)
1. Overall Category                          :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
2. Universities Category                     :   IIT Madras
3. Open Universities Category                :   A new category introduced in 2024.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

In the NIRF 2024 rankings, IIT Madras topped the Overall category for the sixth consecutive year, making pair 1 incorrect. IISc Bangalore consistently topped the Universities category, making pair 2 incorrect.  The NIRF 2024 introduced new categories, including Open Universities, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Dimension                                   Ranking of India (2024)
1. Health and Survival                       :   High ranking among South Asian countries
2. Educational Attainment                  :   Significant improvement from 2023
3. Political Empowerment                     :   Small decline compared to 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's ranking in health and survival is relatively high compared to other South Asian countries due to improvements in several health indicators, making pair 1 correct.

In the 2024 report, India showed a small decline in Educational Attainment and Political Empowerment dimensions, making pair 2 incorrect.

India experienced a small decline in its Political Empowerment dimension in 2024 compared to 2023, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Skill Development
2.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme : Habitat Rights
3.  Ayushman Bharat Card (PM Jan Arogya Yojana) :  Forest-based Livelihoods
4.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan               :  Universalization of Access to Education for ST Students


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a comprehensive scheme aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  A key component involves skill development and entrepreneurship promotion to enhance livelihood opportunities. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme" focuses on the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs, which includes securing their habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan aims to make quality education affordable and accessible to all students, including those from Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (c) is incorrect because Ayushman Bharat is a health insurance scheme, not directly related to forest-based livelihoods. Option (a) and (d) are partially correct but miss crucial connections. Option (a) omits the crucial education component of PM-JUGA and the crucial habitat rights component of the PVTGs Scheme.  Option (d) incorrectly links Ayushman Bharat to the PVTGs Scheme.  The inclusion of Ayushman Bharat and its mismatching in options (c) and (d) serves as a clever distractor, highlighting the need for precise understanding of each scheme's objectives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                             Key Provision
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                 :  Repealed the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
2.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines 'sexual harassment' based on Vishaka Judgement
3.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Focuses on habitat rights for PVTGs
4.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) Act, 2023 :  Established the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, does not repeal the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871; that Act was repealed separately in 1952. However, the FRA is crucial for recognizing forest rights of tribal communities. The POSH Act indeed defines sexual harassment in line with the Vishaka guidelines from the Supreme Court.  The UN-CRPD does not focus on habitat rights; that is related to the Forest Rights Act. The ANRF Act is not related to the NIRF; NIRF was launched separately by the Ministry of Education.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The incorrect pairings in options (c) and (d) act as strong distractors, requiring the candidate to have a precise understanding of each act's provisions.  The inclusion of unrelated acts like the UN-CRPD and ANRF Act adds to the question's difficulty.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Objective
1. Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) :  Establish world-class research centers
2. Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) :  Mentorship for nascent research universities
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)           :  Support priority-driven research in areas like EV mobility
4.  National Education Policy (NEP)           :  Seed, grow, and foster research culture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PAIR aims to pair universities with established institutions for mentorship, not to establish research centers.  MAHA supports priority-driven research, not mentorship.  ACE's objective is indeed to establish world-class research centers. The NEP's recommendation directly influences ANRF's aim to foster a research culture.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options include plausible but incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific initiatives under ANRF.  The inclusion of NEP as a distractor further increases the question's difficulty level.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                  State/Region Primarily Associated With
1.  Konda Reddis                             :  Chhattisgarh
2.  Juang                                   :  Madhya Pradesh
3.  Mankidia                               : Odisha
4.  Poumai Naga                              : Manipur


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Konda Reddis are primarily associated with Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, not Chhattisgarh.  The Juang tribe is primarily located in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  Mankidia are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Odisha. The Poumai Naga tribe is primarily located in Manipur.  Hence, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, requiring the candidate to have detailed knowledge of the geographical distribution of various tribal groups.  The inclusion of several tribal groups from different parts of India adds to the difficulty of this question.


**5. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Category                          Year of Inclusion/Addition
1. Open Universities                          : 2024
2. State Public Universities                   : 2022
3. Skill Universities                          : 2023
4. Innovation Ranking                         : 2021


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities were all added in the 2024 NIRF rankings.  The Innovation ranking was integrated into the NIRF framework earlier than 2021. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The other options include plausible but incorrect years, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific timeline of changes in the NIRF framework.  The inclusion of closely related but incorrect years adds to the difficulty level and tests the candidate's retention of precise details.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Key Feature/Implementation Detail
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Covers 63,000 villages, benefiting over 5 crore tribal people
2. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                            :  Provides pucca houses with access to tapped water and electricity
3. Skill India Mission                                   :  Offers long-term skill courses for ST boys/girls post 10th/12th
4. National Health Mission                               :  Improves infrastructure for better health, nutrition, and education
5. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                             :  Aims to increase Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) to national levels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, covering a vast geographical area and population as stated. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is a flagship housing scheme that includes provisions for water and electricity connections. The Skill India Mission focuses on skill development, including long-term courses for Scheduled Tribe youth. The National Health Mission and Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan are both crucial government schemes aimed at improving health infrastructure and increasing educational access and GER for tribal populations respectively.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall of government schemes and their implementation details, crucial for understanding social welfare policies in India.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Provision/Impact
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         :  Repealed in 1949
2. The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)
3. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013          : Guarantees right to food as a statutory right
4.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Adopted in 2006, entered into force in 2008
5.  ANRF Act 2023                                  : Established the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the respective legislation and their key features or impacts. The Criminal Tribes Act was indeed repealed, signifying a shift in policy towards marginalized communities. The POSH Act established a mechanism for addressing sexual harassment at the workplace.  The NFSA legally enshrines the right to food. The UN-CRPD timeline is correct, reflecting its adoption and enforcement. Finally, the ANRF Act established the ANRF.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of various legal frameworks and their implications. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.  This question assesses factual recall and understanding of significant legislation impacting various social and developmental sectors in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                           Characteristic/Location
1. Konyak Tribe                                      : Nagaland
2. Irula Tribe                                       :  Classified as a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Tamil Nadu
3.  Poumai Naga Tribe                               : Primarily located in Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh
4.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                         :  Were formerly "notified" as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
5.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)     :  Identified based on criteria including forest-based livelihoods and low literacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Konyak tribe's association with Nagaland, the Irula tribe's PVTG status in Tamil Nadu, the Poumai Naga tribe's location, the historical context of DNTs, and the criteria for identifying PVTGs are all accurate.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, showcasing knowledge of various tribal groups in India and their characteristics. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall related to tribal communities in India, demonstrating knowledge of their geographical distribution, social classifications, and historical context.  This is crucial for understanding India's diverse population and its unique challenges.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                           Objective/Focus Area
1.  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality    : Launched in Davos 2024, supported by Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)       : Aims to foster a culture of research and innovation
3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)      : Ranks educational institutions based on parameters like teaching, research, and outreach
4.  Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)      : Launched Aadharshila, a National Curriculum for ECCE
5.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                           : Measures hunger levels globally and in specific countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately connects the organization or initiative with its primary objective or area of focus. The Alliance for Global Good focuses on gender equity, the ANRF on research and innovation, NIRF on ranking educational institutions, the MoWCD on early childhood care and education, and the GHI on measuring global hunger.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, reflecting knowledge of various organizations and their roles in different sectors. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to recognize the accuracy of all the matched pairs. This question tests factual recall about different organizations and their work, which is essential for understanding India's national and international collaborations and initiatives.  It also highlights the interdisciplinary nature of development challenges.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
1.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in 10,000 villages.
2.  Aadharshila (National Curriculum for ECCE)        :  Focuses primarily on the development of life energy in children aged 3-6 years.
3.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)    :  Established under the ANRF Act 2022.
4.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)                :  Aims to integrate informal learning into the formal education system.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. While the initial plan mentioned 63,000 villages, the  precise number might vary.  Therefore, statement 1 is largely correct. Aadharshila, the National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), is a comprehensive curriculum covering various aspects of child development, including physical, emotional, intellectual, and spiritual development.  It does not however focus primarily on life energy development. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act 2023, not 2022. Statement 3 is therefore incorrect.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) aims to formally recognize skills and knowledge acquired through non-formal and informal learning, integrating them into the formal education system, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Provision/Impact
1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                           :  Officially repealed in 1950.
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Primarily deals with issues of child labour.
3.  Habitual Offenders Act (State-level)                 :  Recommended for immediate repeal by the Idate Commission (2017).
4.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Entered into force in 2007.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed in 1952, not 1950. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, primarily deals with the care and protection of children in conflict with the law and those in need of care and protection. While child labour is indirectly addressed, it's not the primary focus. The Idate Commission (2017) recommended the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act in various states due to its potential for misuse and harassment. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) entered into force in 2008, not 2007. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                  Function/Characteristic
1.  UNHCR                                             :  Deals primarily with issues of internally displaced persons.
2.  UNESCAP                                          :  Focuses exclusively on economic development in South Asia.
3.  IOM                                                :  Works specifically on issues related to climate change refugees.
4.  NIRF                                               :  Ranks educational institutions based on research output only.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) None
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) deals with refugees and asylum seekers, not primarily internally displaced persons. UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) focuses on broader socio-economic issues across the Asia-Pacific region, not exclusively on South Asia. The IOM (International Organization for Migration) works on various migration-related issues, including those influenced by climate change, but it's not its sole focus.  NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) uses multiple parameters beyond research output for ranking institutions.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Policy                                   Related Initiative/Program
1.  Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE)         :  Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme.
2.  Live-in Relationships                           :  Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code.
3.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)              :  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020.
4.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST): Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While ECCE is important for overall child development, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme primarily focuses on promoting the education and empowerment of girls.  Uttarakhand's Uniform Civil Code includes provisions related to the registration of live-in relationships. RPL aligns with the goals of NEP 2020 to broaden access to higher education and recognize diverse learning pathways.  PM-JUGA utilizes funding from the DAPST. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Report/Initiative
    1. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)       : Food Waste Index Report 2024
    2. UN Environment Programme (UNEP)            : Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
    3. Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) : Food Loss Index (FLI)
    4. Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) :  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), not the Food Waste Index Report 2024.  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), along with WRAP, launched the Food Waste Index Report 2024, not the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC). The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN),  a partner in the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC).  The GNAFC itself did not launch *The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024*; that report has a different origin.  This question tests factual recall of the organizations and their respective reports/initiatives, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in understanding global food security initiatives.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, drawing on the interconnectedness of these organizations within the broader context of food security and nutrition.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                      Custodian Organization
    1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                        : UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
    2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                       : World Food Programme (WFP)
    3. SDG 12.3.1 (a)                              : Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    4. SDG 12.3.1 (b)                              : Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of SDG 12.3.1 (a), which relates to reducing food losses. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI), not the Food Loss Index (FLI). The World Food Programme (WFP) is not the custodian of either index. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) partnered with UNEP on the FWI report, but is not its custodian. This question assesses the understanding of the specific roles of different organizations in tracking and addressing global food waste and loss, showcasing the need for precise knowledge of global initiatives related to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The distractors aim to confuse the candidate by intermixing organizations and indicators related to food security and sustainability.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                                  Ministry/Organization
    1.  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) assessment   : Ministry of Commerce and Industry
    2. Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) assessment : Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
    3. Spot Food License Initiative                   :  World Health Organization (WHO)
    4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)  :  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare launched the NQAS assessment for IPHLs. The NQAS assessment for AAMs also falls under the purview of the same ministry. The Spot Food License Initiative is also managed by the Indian government, not the WHO. The FAO is not involved in the NQAS. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian government schemes and their associated ministries, emphasizing the importance of understanding the organizational structure and responsibilities within the Indian healthcare system. The distractors are designed to create confusion by including plausible but incorrect pairings involving different international and national organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                     Key Finding/Focus
    1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                 :  Halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030
    2. Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :  Hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels
    3. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024: Focuses on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.
    4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)          : Households across all continents wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition. The GRFC highlights acute food insecurity issues.  The GHI 2024 focuses on hunger levels globally,  not food waste reduction. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 details household food waste, but also its environmental impact.  This question assesses the ability to connect specific reports with their core findings, requiring a deeper understanding of the content and implications of each report. The distractors are carefully chosen to include plausible but ultimately incorrect connections between the reports and their key findings, testing the candidate’s ability to critically evaluate the information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                             Focus/Objective
    1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :  Skill Development and Entrepreneurship Promotion
    2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana      :   Provision of Supplementary Nutrition
    3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0         :  Provide food grains free of cost to the poor
    4.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Wage support and nutritious food for registered women


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides wage support and nutritious food to registered women. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities. PMGKAY provides free food grains, and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition. This question tests the understanding of various Indian government schemes aimed at improving nutrition and social welfare, requiring knowledge of the specific objectives and target groups of each program.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, involving similar social welfare programs with overlapping but distinct goals.  The candidate must be able to differentiate between the nuances of these schemes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Ministry/Organization Primarily Involved
1. PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) : Ministry of Rural Development
2. National Health Mission                               :  World Health Organization
3. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission)          : Ministry of Women and Child Development
4.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                            : Ministry of Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a flagship program focused on the comprehensive development of tribal communities across India.  While it leverages funds from various ministries, its implementation and overall oversight primarily fall under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Therefore, option 1 is correct.

POSHAN Abhiyan, aiming to improve nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers, is a central government scheme primarily spearheaded by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  This makes option 3 correct.

Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, a comprehensive program for school education, is a central scheme implemented by the Ministry of Education. This makes option 4 correct.

The National Health Mission, however, is a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders including the central and state governments, international organizations like WHO and UNICEF. While WHO provides technical guidance and support, the primary implementing agency is the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Hence, option 2 is incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Program                                      Key Feature/Objective
1.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
2. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013           :  Establishes the right to food as a legal entitlement.
3.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition                      : Aims to eradicate hunger and all forms of malnutrition globally.
4.  Ayushman Bharat Card (PM Jan Arogya Yojana)      :  Provides financial protection against healthcare expenses.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs, making statement 1 correct.  The NFSA legally recognizes the right to food for a significant portion of the Indian population, confirming statement 2. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition sets a global goal to eliminate hunger and malnutrition, making statement 3 correct. Ayushman Bharat, through its card, provides a crucial financial safety net for healthcare, validating statement 4. All four pairs are accurately matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                    Organization/Agency Responsible for Publication
1. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)            : Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
2. Food Waste Index Report (FWI)                   : UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report :  World Food Programme (WFP) only
4. National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India:  World Health Organization (WHO) only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Global Report on Food Crises is indeed produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), making statement 1 correct. The Food Waste Index Report is a joint publication of UNEP and WRAP, confirming statement 2.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is a collaborative effort of five UN agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO, not solely the WFP. Similarly, statement 4 is incorrect; the NHA estimates are derived within the framework of national guidelines and use the System of Health Accounts (SHA), which is a joint collaboration of OECD, WHO, and Eurostat, not solely the WHO.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                                 Primary Goal
1.  Lakhpati Didi Initiative                         : To increase the annual household income of SHG members to ₹1 lakh or more.
2.  White Revolution 2.0                            : To increase milk procurement to 1,000 lakh kg/day by 2029.
3.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty      : To eradicate hunger and poverty, and reduce inequalities.
4.  The Eat Right Movement                        : To promote healthy eating habits and reduce malnutrition.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi Initiative explicitly aims to raise the annual household income of Self Help Group (SHG) members to at least ₹1 lakh, making option 1 correct. White Revolution 2.0 is focused on significantly increasing milk procurement in India, aligning with option 2. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty directly addresses hunger, poverty, and inequality reduction, as stated in option 3. The Eat Right Movement is a public health campaign that promotes healthy dietary choices and combats malnutrition, making option 4 correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                           State/Region Primarily Associated
1. Juangs                                            : Odisha
2. Bharias                                           : Madhya Pradesh
3.  Konda Reddis                                     : Andhra Pradesh and Odisha
4.  Maria Gond                                      : Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Juangs are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) primarily residing in Odisha, making statement 1 correct. The Bharias are another tribal community largely found in Madhya Pradesh, confirming statement 2.  Konda Reddis are a tribal group inhabiting parts of both Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, validating statement 3.  The Maria Gond tribe is significantly present in Maharashtra, making statement 4 correct. All four pairs show a correct association between tribal groups and their main regions of habitation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking Framework                     Key Feature
1. NIRF 2024                              :   Includes rankings for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities
2. QS World University Rankings 2025    :   Uses 18 indicators to assess institutions across five key areas
3. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Based on 9 performance indicators
4. University Impact Rankings 2024       :   Ranks universities based on their contributions to the UN Sustainable Development Goals

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings notably introduced new categories for Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities, expanding its scope beyond the traditional categories.  This makes statement 1 correct. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 utilizes 18 indicators across five key areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry engagement, and international outlook. This aligns with statement 2.  Statement 4 is also correct as the University Impact Rankings specifically assesses universities based on their performance across the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Statement 3 is incorrect; the QS World University Rankings uses 9 performance indicators, not the Times Higher Education rankings.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to include the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of each ranking framework and its specific assessment criteria is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of global higher education evaluation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                                 Characteristic

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The FAO is indeed the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), making statement 2 correct.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was a joint effort between UNEP and WRAP, making statement 4 correct.  Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect.  GAIN focuses on improving nutrition, not tracking food waste.  UNEP's role is primarily related to environmental concerns, not direct investments in nutrition in the agri-food sector.  This question tests knowledge of various international organizations and their specific areas of focus within the context of food security and sustainability.  The distractors highlight the need for precise understanding of each organization's mandate.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, explicitly states that only Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) ranked within the top 500 globally, either overall or in specific subject areas, are eligible to establish campuses in India.  This aligns perfectly with the aim of bringing in high-quality international institutions.  The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, a landmark reform in Indian higher education, centrally features the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, promoting flexibility and mobility in learning. This enhances the quality and accessibility of higher education.  Finally, the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) initiative aims to formally acknowledge and integrate learning acquired through non-formal and informal channels, thereby recognizing diverse learning pathways and experiences.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health Initiative                                    Key Characteristic
1. National Health Accounts Estimates (NHA)       :   Released annually since 2013-14 by the MoHFW

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Health Accounts Estimates (NHA), released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) since 2013-14, provide a comprehensive financial overview of India's healthcare system, tracking fund allocation and utilization.  The National Family Health Survey (NFHS) is a large-scale, nationally representative survey that collects in-depth data on various health and nutrition indicators, providing crucial insights into the health status of the population.  The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, introduced several significant changes, including the establishment of a States Parties Committee to enhance the effectiveness of IHR implementation, improving global health security. Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, leaving out at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Provision
1. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005: Applies only to women of specific religious affiliations
2. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015: Defines a child as someone below 18 years of age
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act):  Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PWDVA, 2005, is explicitly designed to protect women from domestic violence regardless of their religious or social background, making statement 1 incorrect. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, clearly defines a child as someone below the age of 18, aligning with statement 2. The POSH Act, 2013, mandates the establishment of Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces to address sexual harassment complaints, supporting statement 3. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Framework/Index                                      Key Feature
1. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024        : Includes ranking for Open Universities
2. Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025: Uses 18 indicators to assess institutions
3. QS World University Rankings 2025                         : Top-ranked Indian institution is IIT Bombay


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced new categories, including Open Universities, reflecting a broader scope of assessment.  The THE World University Rankings 2025 employs a comprehensive methodology using 18 indicators across five key areas.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 indeed places IIT Bombay as the highest-ranked Indian institution.  All three pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of the respective ranking frameworks. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they fail to include all correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Category                                 Characteristic
1. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                           : Were designated as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)      :  Concentrated in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra (among others)
3. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes                    :  Categorized solely as hunter-gatherers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were historically labeled as "criminal tribes" under the British Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory practice.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are indeed concentrated in states like Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra, reflecting their geographical distribution. However, nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes encompass a wider range of livelihoods beyond just hunter-gatherers; they include pastoralists, traders, and entertainers. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of nomadic tribes in pair 3.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provision of supplementary nutrition
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna          :  Financial assistance for registered women
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0           : Free food grains to 80 crore poor
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     : Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is a scheme that provides free food grains to a large section of the poor population in India.  Option 1 incorrectly links it to supplementary nutrition; that is a feature of other schemes like Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana offers financial assistance to registered pregnant women and lactating mothers, aligning with option 2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition to address nutritional deficiencies, making option 3 incorrect in its pairing. The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food, correctly matched in option 4. Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly paired.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairings of PMGKAY and Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0.  Understanding the specific objectives and functionalities of each scheme is crucial for correctly matching them with their key features. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring candidates to differentiate between similar-sounding government schemes.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 did indeed rank India, correctly reflecting the information given in pair 1. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, centrally addresses the issue of financing mechanisms to combat hunger and malnutrition, as stated in pair 2.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 accurately monitors food waste at the retail and consumer levels, matching pair 3. Finally, the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is correctly attributed to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) in pair 4.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  Selecting any option other than (d) would indicate a misunderstanding of the key findings and focuses of these significant reports in the field of global food security and nutrition. This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect reports with their core themes.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 rankings did introduce a new category for Skill Universities, making pair 1 correct.  The World University Rankings 2025 are indeed published by Times Higher Education (THE), validating pair 2.  IIT Bombay secured the top position among Indian institutions in the QS World University Rankings 2025, confirming pair 3. Lastly, the University Impact Rankings 2024 accurately identify universities excelling in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), making pair 4 correct.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) does indeed define "habitat" as specified in pair 1. The UGC regulations for foreign university campuses correctly stipulate that universities must be ranked within the global top 500, or possess outstanding expertise, to establish campuses in India, making pair 2 incorrect as it only mentions the top 500. The amended International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, did establish a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to assist developing countries, thereby validating pair 3.  Finally, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a statutory right, confirming pair 4.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, leading to option (c) as the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccurate pairing in point 2.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to connect legislation with its key features.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 provides a comprehensive assessment of global food waste. The Food Waste Index (FWI) specifically tracks food waste generation at various stages, including retail and consumer levels (households and food services). This aligns directly with Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12.3, which aims to reduce food waste and loss.  SDG 12.3.1(a) focuses on reducing food losses throughout the production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is responsible for monitoring this indicator. SDG 12.3.1(b) aims to reduce per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by half. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of this specific indicator.  Therefore, all the pairs correctly link the index, indicators, and their respective custodians. Option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, leaving out at least one correct pairing.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The "Mission for Enhanced Tribal Empowerment" is a multi-faceted initiative aimed at improving the lives of tribal communities in India.  The mission's goals are interconnected and rely on the convergence of several existing government schemes.  The goal of providing pucca houses to eligible tribal households directly aligns with the PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), the rural component of the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana.  Improving village infrastructure, including all-weather road connectivity, is a key element of the PM Gram Sadak Yojana.  Skill development initiatives to empower tribal individuals are implemented through the Skill India Mission.  Improving education access and increasing the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) is achieved through the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.  Finally, enhancing access to quality health facilities is connected to the PM ABHIM (Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission).  All the pairs accurately reflect the convergence of these schemes within the larger mission framework.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting at least one correct pairing.

(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biwako Millennium Framework indeed works towards creating an inclusive and barrier-free society for people with disabilities.  The Incheon Strategy, adopted in 2012, directly addresses the implementation of the rights of persons with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on making those rights real. The Declaration on Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region complements the Incheon Strategy by emphasizing the full and equal participation of people with disabilities.

Option (a) is incorrect because the UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not 2007.  Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched Biwako Millennium Framework. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched UN-CRPD entry into force date.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international initiatives concerning disability rights and their key features, demanding precise factual recall.  Understanding the nuances and interconnectedness of these initiatives is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of disability inclusion policies.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-ABHIM (Pradhan Mantri Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission) is accurately paired with its objective of improving access to quality healthcare for Scheduled Tribes. PM-SHRI (Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India) is correctly matched; while it has broader applications, it does involve infrastructure upgradation in government schools, which indirectly benefits tribal children.  The other options are incorrect because PM-JUGA's goal is broader than just healthcare; it encompasses socio-economic development across several sectors for tribal communities.  ABDM is not exclusively limited to tribal healthcare records; it aims to create a national digital health ecosystem.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of government schemes targeted at tribal welfare and healthcare, demanding both factual recall and analytical skills to differentiate between the primary and secondary impacts of these initiatives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities by converging existing schemes. The PVTGs scheme focuses on the holistic development of particularly vulnerable tribal groups while respecting their cultural heritage. Aadharshila is indeed a comprehensive curriculum designed for early childhood care and education in anganwadis, covering a 48-week period. Finally, RPL is accurately described as a formal system for assessing prior learning acquired through various means, integrating it into formal education.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.

    4. SERB                                 :  Continues to operate independently alongside ANRF.
    5.  National Education Policy            :  Provides the guiding framework for ANRF's aim of creating a knowledge-driven society.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
    (c) 1 and 4 only
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was established to foster research and innovation in India.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) indeed pairs established institutions with those at a nascent stage for mentorship.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas) correctly focuses on solution-driven research in priority areas. ACE (ANRF Centre of Excellence) aims to create world-class research centers. The National Education Policy provides the overarching framework for ANRF’s goals.  However, SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board) was subsumed into ANRF; it no longer operates independently. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect as it omits the crucial role of the National Education Policy. Option (c) is wrong because SERB has been integrated into ANRF. Option (d) is incorrect because it mistakenly includes SERB as an independent entity and omits the crucial NEP connection.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    **Indicator/Finding**                      **Value/Description**
    1. Global GHI score                       : 18.3 (Moderate)
    2. India's GHI rank                         : 105th out of 127 countries
    3. Percentage of India's population with undernourishment   : 13.7%
    4. Percentage of Indian children under five experiencing child wasting : 18.7%
    5.  Percentage of Indian children under five experiencing stunting  : 35.5%

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (c) 1, 3, and 5 only
    (d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report provides data on global and national hunger levels.  All the pairs correctly reflect the findings of the report.  The global GHI score was 18.3, categorized as moderate. India's rank was 105th out of 127 countries.  The report indicated that 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment.  Child wasting and stunting rates among children under five were 18.7% and 35.5% respectively.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete, omitting crucial data points from the GHI 2024 report.


**4. With reference to initiatives for tackling hunger in India, consider the following pairs:**

    **Scheme/Program**                    **Key Feature/Objective**
    1. PMGKAY                               : Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor.
    2. PM Matru Vandana Yojana              : Provides financial assistance and nutritious food to registered pregnant women.
    3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    : Aims to bridge the gap between recommended and average daily dietary intake.
    4. National Food Security Act (NFSA)    : Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right.
    5. Eat Right Movement                  : Focuses on improving dietary habits and reducing malnutrition, but not directly food distribution.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 5 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian government has implemented several schemes to address hunger and malnutrition.  PMGKAY (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) provides free food grains. PM Matru Vandana Yojana offers financial support and nutritious food to pregnant women.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to improve nutritional intake. The NFSA legally recognizes the right to food.  The Eat Right Movement focuses on behavioral change and improving dietary choices but doesn't involve direct food distribution. Option (b) is incorrect because it wrongly links Eat Right Movement with direct food distribution. Option (c) omits PMGKAY. Option (d) also excludes the crucial NFSA.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

    **Aspect of UN-CRPD**                 **Feature/Provision**
    1. Adoption Year                          : 2008
    2. Number of Signatories (including India) : 164
    3.  Objective                             : To protect and ensure the full enjoyment of human rights by all persons with disabilities.
    4.  17th Conference of State Parties Theme  :  "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future".
    5.  Definition of Persons with Disabilities  : Includes those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual or sensory impairments.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 5 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD is a significant international treaty promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. While the convention was *adopted* in 2006, it *entered into force* in 2008.  The number of signatories, including India, is 164. The core objective aligns with protecting and ensuring the full enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities. The 17th Conference of State Parties did indeed have the stated theme.  The definition of persons with disabilities encompasses those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments. Therefore, option (a) is incorrect because it wrongly states the adoption year. Option (c) omits the 17th conference theme and the number of signatories. Option (d) incorrectly states the adoption year. Only option (b) correctly matches all the pairs, except for a minor correction on the adoption year.


**1. With reference to anti-doping measures in sports, consider the following pairs:**

     Initiative/Act                                      Description/Feature
    1.  NADA’s #PlayTrue Campaign                   :   Commemorates WADA’s Play True Day.
    2.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport :   Adopted in 2005, aims to eliminate doping.
    3.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985  :   Governs the use of narcotic substances in sports.
    4. Anti-Doping helpline number                    : Provides information on anti-doping rules and guidelines.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The #PlayTrue campaign by NADA (National Anti-Doping Agency) directly relates to and commemorates WADA's (World Anti-Doping Agency) Play True Day, making pair 1 correct.  The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005, is indeed focused on the prevention and elimination of doping in sports globally, thus pair 2 is also correct. The Anti-Doping helpline offers information on rules and guidelines, validating pair 4. However, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, while relevant to substance abuse, isn't specifically designed for or solely focused on the anti-doping context in sports.  Its scope is broader, encompassing various aspects of drug control beyond the sporting arena. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include pair 3, which is mismatched. Option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to multilingualism initiatives in Indian education, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                        Key Feature/Implementation Detail
    1. ASMITA Project                               :   Production of 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over 5 years.
    2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                         :   A multilingual dictionary repository.
    3. Real-time Translation Architecture            :   Focuses on enhancing translation using advanced technology.
    4. New Education Policy 2020                   :   Directly mandates multilingual education initiatives.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ASMITA project's core function is the creation of educational materials in various scheduled languages, aligning with the stated detail in pair 1.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh, as a multilingual dictionary repository, accurately fits its description in pair 2.  The Real-time Translation Architecture initiative indeed employs cutting-edge technology for improved translation, making pair 3 correct. However, while the New Education Policy 2020 promotes multilingualism, it doesn't directly *mandate* specific initiatives like ASMITA or Bahubhasha Shabdkosh.  The policy sets the overall framework, but the implementation is through separate projects. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the mismatched pair 4.  Only option (a) accurately represents the correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to higher education rankings and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Institution
    1. QS World University Rankings 2025               :   Includes IIT Bombay as a top-ranked Indian institution.
    2. University Impact Rankings 2024                  :  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as the top-ranked Indian university.
    3. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:   Facilitates the entry of top 500 global universities.
    4. NIRF 2024                                       :   IIT Madras topped the overall category.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings 2025 indeed features IIT Bombay among its top-ranked Indian institutions, confirming pair 1.  The University Impact Rankings 2024 correctly identifies Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as the top-ranked Indian university, validating pair 2.  The UGC regulations of 2023 are designed to allow top global universities to set up campuses in India, making pair 3 accurate.  Finally, IIT Madras did top the overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings, confirming pair 4.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to government schemes and projects for tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Project                                       Key Objective/Feature
    1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
    2. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan     :   Named after Birsa Munda.
    3.  PM-JUGA                                          :   Includes initiatives like Tribal Home Stays and TMMCs.
    4.  Habitat Rights (under FRA)                        : Granted to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA's primary goal is enhancing the socio-economic status of tribal communities, making pair 1 correct.  The scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda, validating pair 2.  PM-JUGA does encompass initiatives like Tribal Home Stays and Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs), confirming pair 3.  Habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA) are specifically provided to PVTGs, making pair 4 correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is correct.  The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of government schemes.


**5. With reference to the National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 and related matters, consider the following pairs:**

     Policy/Initiative                                      Key Element/Feature
    1. Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024         :   Has five pillars focusing on holistic sports development.
    2.  Khelo India Scheme                             :  Aimed at promoting sports at the grassroots level.
    3. Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)           :   Supports athletes aiming for Olympic medals.
    4.  2022 WADA testing figures                     : Showed India having the highest percentage of doping offenders.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NSP 2024 is structured around five pillars for comprehensive sports development, making pair 1 correct.  The Khelo India Scheme is explicitly designed to nurture sports talent at the grassroots level, validating pair 2.  TOPS directly supports athletes in their Olympic medal pursuits, confirming pair 3.  The 2022 WADA data indeed indicated India having the highest percentage of doping violations, making pair 4 accurate.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.  The other options inaccurately exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests factual knowledge and understanding of sports policies and initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                  Organization/Report
1. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)           :   Times Higher Education (THE)
2. QS World University Rankings             :   Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
3. University Impact Rankings               :   World Economic Forum (WEF)
4. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) :  Ministry of Education, India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The QS World University Rankings are indeed released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), and the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is implemented by the Ministry of Education in India.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not Times Higher Education (THE).  THE publishes the World University Rankings, a different ranking system.

Option 3 is incorrect because while the University Impact Rankings are indeed a ranking system, they are published by Times Higher Education (THE), not the World Economic Forum (WEF). The WEF publishes the Global Gender Gap Report, which includes the GGGI.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country Ranking (2024)               Index/Report
1. India                                  :   108th in Global Gender Gap Index
2. Iceland                               :   1st in Global Gender Inequality Index
3. Norway                                :   Top 3 in Global Gender Gap Report
4. Denmark                               :   Top 3 in University Impact Rankings


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Norway is indeed among the top three countries in the 2024 Global Gender Gap Report.

Option 1 is incorrect. While India's ranking is mentioned in relation to gender inequality, the specific ranking of 108th is associated with the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, not the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) from the same year.  The GGGI and GII are different indices measuring different aspects of gender equality.

Option 2 is incorrect. Iceland consistently ranks highly in gender equality indices, but the statement incorrectly assigns it the top position in the GII. Iceland's top ranking is typically associated with the Global Gender Gap Report.

Option 4 is incorrect.  Denmark's high ranking is usually associated with indices like the Gender Inequality Index (GII) or the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI), not the University Impact Rankings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                    Key Feature/Location
1. Alliance for Global Good                  :   Launched in Davos 2024
2. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty:   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil
3.  GAIN                                     :   Headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland
4.  World Food Programme                     :   Established in 1961


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Alliance for Global Good was indeed launched at the Davos 2024 World Economic Forum. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) has its headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. And the World Food Programme was established in 1961.  These are all verifiable facts about these organizations and initiatives.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                 Objective/Feature
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) :   Defines sexual harassment in line with the Vishaka judgment
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:   Facilitates entry of top 500 global universities
3.  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005    :   Established a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013                     :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The POSH Act does indeed align its definition of sexual harassment with the Vishaka judgment. The UGC regulations aim to facilitate the entry of high-ranking foreign universities.  The IHR amendments did establish a States Parties Committee.

Option 4 is incorrect. While the NFSA addresses food security, it recognizes the right to food as a *statutory*, not a *fundamental*, right.  This distinction is crucial in Indian constitutional law.  The fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of the Constitution, while the NFSA is a statutory enactment.  This subtle but important difference makes option 4 incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                     Key Finding/Feature
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                  :   134 years to reach full gender parity at current rate
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)            :   Produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                   :   Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels
4. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 did project that it will take 134 years to achieve full gender parity at the current rate of progress. The Global Report on Food Crises is indeed produced annually by the FSIN.  The Food Waste Index Report tracks food waste at the specified levels.  And the State of Food Security and Nutrition report focused on financing for food security and nutrition.  Therefore, all the pairings are accurate reflections of the reports' content and features.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Key Feature
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 :   Establishes the right to food as a fundamental right
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                           :   Focuses on improving maternal and child nutrition
3. Eat Right Movement                        :   Aims to promote healthy eating habits

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a statutory right for a significant portion of the Indian population, ensuring access to subsidized food grains.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a flagship program of the Indian government focused on improving nutritional outcomes for pregnant women, lactating mothers, and children under six years of age.  The Eat Right Movement complements these efforts by promoting healthy dietary habits and reducing the burden of diet-related diseases. All three initiatives are correctly matched with their primary objectives. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Focus
1. World Food Programme (WFP)              :   Combating hunger through food aid and nutrition enhancement
2. UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) :   Providing technical assistance for sustainable agriculture
3. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty :   Eradicating hunger and poverty through policy instruments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is the leading humanitarian organization fighting hunger worldwide, providing food assistance and promoting food security. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger.  Its mandate includes providing technical assistance to countries for improving agricultural practices and promoting sustainable food systems. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to eradicate hunger and poverty and reduce inequalities, employing a multi-pronged approach involving policy instruments, partnerships, and resource mobilization.  All three organizations are accurately paired with their core functions. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Declaration                        Key Theme/Objective
1. Rome Declaration on Nutrition             :   Eradicating hunger and malnutrition globally
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:  Financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024            :   Tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rome Declaration on Nutrition sets a global commitment to eradicate hunger and all forms of malnutrition. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses specifically on the financing mechanisms needed to achieve this goal.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 directly addresses the issue of food waste, providing data on its extent at different stages of the food supply chain. All three reports and declarations are correctly matched with their respective themes and objectives.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Convention/Initiative                        Key Characteristic
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):  Promotes full and equal enjoyment of rights for persons with disabilities
2. Biwako Millennium Framework                 : Aims for an inclusive and barrier-free society
3. Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region: Focuses on disability inclusion in the Asia-Pacific

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a landmark international treaty that establishes the rights and freedoms of people with disabilities.

(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 rankings indeed saw IIT Madras securing the top position in the Overall category for the sixth consecutive year.  This makes statement 1 correct.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 placed the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, as the highest-ranked Indian university, making statement 2 correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 did feature Indian universities, IISc Bangalore, not Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, was the top-ranked Indian institution in that ranking.  Statement 4 is accurate; the University Impact Rankings 2024 highlighted India's significant presence, with 96 institutions featured, making it the most-represented country.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  The distractor, statement 3, uses a real university but incorrectly pairs it with the ranking. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific ranking details and their ability to differentiate between various global university ranking systems.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts Estimates, consider the following pairs:**

     Feature                                   Detail

4.  First released in                          :   2012-13


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Health Accounts Estimates are indeed released by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), making statement 1 correct.  The initial release of these estimates was in 2013-14, not 2012-13, correcting statement 4.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the estimates are envisioned in the National Health Policy, 2002, not 2010.  Finally, statement 3 is also incorrect as the System of Health Accounts, 2011, was used, not 2001. Thus, only statements 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests knowledge of the specific details of the National Health Accounts Estimates, including the releasing agency, the year of first release, and the policy document it stems from.  The incorrect options present plausible but incorrect dates and policy years, making the question challenging.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amendment defining a pandemic emergency does indeed include the criterion of a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capabilities, making statement 1 correct.  The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism is specifically intended to address the needs of developing countries, making statement 2 incorrect.  Creating National IHR Authorities is designed to improve coordination among countries, making statement 3 correct.  The World Health Assembly (WHA) is the decision-making body of the WHO, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests understanding of the key amendments to the IHR and their intended impact, requiring detailed knowledge of the specifics.  The distractors manipulate the beneficiaries of the financial mechanism, creating a challenging discrimination task for the candidate.

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index (FWI) report is indeed produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is an annual publication of the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). However, the Food Loss Index (FLI) is under the custodianship of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not the World Food Programme (WFP).  The WFP plays a crucial role in addressing food crises, but the FLI's development and monitoring fall under the FAO's mandate concerning global food security and agricultural statistics.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the custodian of FLI is FAO. Option (b) is incorrect as it misses the correct matching of GRFC with FSIN. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatched pair involving FLI and WFP.  Understanding the roles of different UN agencies in global food security is crucial for UPSC preparation, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of organizational responsibilities.

2. Spot Food License Initiative                    :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Spot Food License Initiative and the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment are both implemented under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The NQAS assessment, focusing on Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), directly relates to healthcare standards and quality control. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to streamline food licensing through digital platforms, also aligning with public health regulations.  However, the assessment of Ayushman Arogya Mandirs is not under the Ministry of Rural Development; it falls under the health ministry's responsibility due to its direct link to healthcare infrastructure and quality.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly assign the responsibility for AAM assessment to either the wrong ministry or include the incorrectly matched pair.  Understanding the organizational structures and responsibilities within the Indian government is critical for UPSC aspirants.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024, published by the World Economic Forum, assesses gender parity across four dimensions: health and survival, educational attainment, economic participation and opportunity, and political empowerment.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, released by the UNDP, measures gender inequality across reproductive health, empowerment, and economic activity.  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2024 focuses on financing mechanisms to address hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  Therefore, understanding the scope and focus of these reports is crucial for analyzing global development trends and challenges relevant to UPSC examinations.  All options other than (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to empower women by increasing their household income to at least ₹1 lakh annually.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance to pregnant women and mothers for maternal healthcare and nutrition.  However, the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is a broader initiative focused on rural poverty reduction and women's empowerment through self-help groups (SHGs), not specifically focused on promoting tribal tourism.  Tribal tourism is addressed by other specific schemes. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the goals of DAY-NRLM or exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the understanding of various government schemes and their specific objectives, a crucial aspect of UPSC preparation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :   Defines habitat rights for specific tribal groups
2. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Allows top 500 global universities to establish campuses in India
3. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013       :   Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) explicitly defines and provides for habitat rights for specific tribal groups residing in forests.  The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, facilitates the establishment of campuses in India by top-ranked foreign universities.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food for a significant portion of the Indian population.  Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of these acts and regulations is essential for UPSC preparation, requiring recall of specific provisions and their implications.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Provision
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :    Successor to International Sanitary Regulations (1951)
2. World Health Assembly (WHA)                   :    Appoints the Director-General of WHO

(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 replaced the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, creating a legally binding framework for global health emergencies. The World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), holds several key functions, including appointing the Director-General. Project NAMAN leverages the SPARSH digital pension system to support Defence Pensioners. The National Medical Register (NMR) Portal, mandated by the NMC Act of 2019, serves as a comprehensive database for registered doctors.  The Asmita Project aims to create high-quality study materials in various Indian languages. All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

5.  SARTHIE 1.0                                       :    Department of Social Justice and Empowerment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA, aimed at improving tribal communities' socio-economic conditions, falls under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. The National Health Mission is a flagship program of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Swadesh Darshan, promoting tourism, is implemented by the Ministry of Tourism. SPARSH, a digital pension system, is under the Department of Ex-Servicemen Welfare. SARTHIE 1.0, focused on empowering disadvantaged communities, is a joint initiative of the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment and NALSA. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                      Organization/Agency
1.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024  :    Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)                 :    Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                       :    UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
4. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                      :    World Economic Forum (WEF)
5. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022                   :    United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report" is published annually, with the FAO playing a central role. The GRFC is produced by the GNAFC, a collaborative effort. The Food Waste Index Report is published by UNEP in collaboration with WRAP. The Global Gender Gap Report is a flagship publication of the World Economic Forum. The Gender Inequality Index is published by the UNDP.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Provision/Focus
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Habitat Rights for PVTGs
2. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985    :    Anti-doping regulations in sports
3. National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019          :    Establishment of the National Medical Register (NMR)
4. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):   Inclusion of people with disabilities
5. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                           :   Designation of certain communities as "born criminals"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act of 2006 includes provisions for habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). While the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act deals with drug control, it is not directly related to anti-doping regulations in sports (that falls under other international conventions). The NMC Act of 2019 established the NMR. The UN-CRPD focuses on the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities. The Criminal Tribes Act, now repealed, had the controversial provision of labeling certain communities as "criminal tribes."  Option (c) correctly identifies the matched pairs. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion or exclusion of incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Term                                         Definition/Description
1.  Passive Euthanasia                               :    Withdrawal of life support from terminally ill patients
2.  Teal Carbon                                      :    Carbon stored in non-tidal freshwater wetlands
3.  Body Roundness Index (BRI)                         :    Quantifies body fat using height and waist circumference
4.  Village Level Entrepreneur (VLE)                   :    Manages Common Service Centres (CSCs) under Project NAMAN
5.  Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF)                 :    Addresses household vulnerabilities like food insecurity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Passive euthanasia involves ceasing life support for terminally ill patients. Teal carbon refers to carbon sequestration in freshwater wetlands. The BRI is a health metric using height and waist circumference.  Village Level Entrepreneurs manage CSCs in Project NAMAN.  VRF is a fund for addressing household vulnerabilities. All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

    State                          PVTG Tribe
1. Odisha                        :   Paudi Bhuyans
2. Madhya Pradesh              :   Kamars
3. Chhattisgarh                 :   Maria Gond
4. Maharashtra                  :   Bharias

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The Paudi Bhuyans are indeed a PVTG in Odisha.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. The Kamars are a PVTG in Chhattisgarh, not Madhya Pradesh.  The Maria Gond are a PVTG in Maharashtra, not Chhattisgarh.  Finally, the Bharias are a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, not Maharashtra.  The question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of specific PVTG tribes across different Indian states.  Distractors are carefully chosen to represent tribes that *are* PVTGs, but in different states, making it challenging to identify the correct answer without precise knowledge. The incorrect options highlight the importance of accurate knowledge of the specific tribal groups and their locations for a comprehensive understanding of PVTG demographics in India.


**2. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following pairs:**

    Act Provision                                  Specific Tribal Group Mentioned in the Text
1. Section 3(1)(e) of FRA                     :   Juang Tribe of Odisha
2. FRA's definition of 'habitat'                :   Hill Khadia of Mayurbhanj
3. FRA's consultation process                    :   Dongria Kondhs of Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA pertains to habitat rights, and the Juang tribe of Odisha is mentioned in the context of habitat rights. The FRA defines "habitat" in relation to customary habitats of tribal groups, and the Hill Khadia tribe is mentioned in the text.  The FRA mandates a consultation process before granting habitat rights, and the Dongria Kondhs are mentioned within this context. This question tests the understanding of the FRA's provisions and their application to specific tribal groups. The options are designed to be plausible, requiring detailed knowledge of the act and its relation to the mentioned tribes to arrive at the correct answer.  The inclusion of multiple correct pairs increases the difficulty and highlights the interconnected nature of the FRA's provisions.


**3. With reference to the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                                    Specific Action/Beneficiary
1. 100% Central assistance                           :   Construction of community assets
2. Aim of the scheme                               :   Improving literacy rates among PVTGs
3. Micro plan approach                               :   Formulation of CCD plans

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The scheme does provide 100% central assistance, and construction of community assets is explicitly mentioned as an activity funded under the scheme. The micro-plan approach involves creating Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans. However, while the scheme aims for overall socio-economic development, including improvements in education and literacy,  "improving literacy rates among PVTGs" is not a directly stated, specific aim in the provided text. The question tests the understanding of the scheme's features and implementation mechanisms. The distractor in option 2 is plausible because literacy improvement is a desirable outcome, but it's not a stated, specific aim in the text description of the scheme. The correct answer necessitates careful attention to the precise wording of the scheme's description.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Goal                                     Specific Intervention
1. Goal 1 (Developing Enabling Infrastructure)      :   Promoting Tribal Home Stays
2. Goal 2 (Promotion of Economic Empowerment)    :   Ensuring all-weather road connectivity
3. Goal 3 (Universalization of Access to Education) :   Setting up tribal hostels in schools

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Goal 3 of PM-JUGA focuses on education, and setting up tribal hostels in schools is a stated intervention.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. Promoting Tribal Home Stays falls under Goal 2 (Economic Empowerment), not Goal 1 (Infrastructure). Ensuring all-weather road connectivity is an infrastructure goal (Goal 1), not an economic empowerment goal (Goal 2). The question assesses the ability to connect specific interventions to the correct goals within the PM-JUGA scheme. The distractors are designed to be plausible by mixing interventions across different goals, demanding a thorough understanding of the scheme's structure and objectives to arrive at the correct answer.  The incorrect pairings highlight the need for careful analysis of the scheme's components and their alignment with the stated goals.


**5. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Characteristic                                  Example or Related Fact
1.  Heterogeneous occupational distribution        :   Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
2.  Historical categorization as 'born criminal'    :   Salt trading as an occupation
3.  Current legal challenges                         :   Sukanya Santha vs. UoI case

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. DNTs indeed have a heterogeneous occupational distribution, encompassing various professions. The Sukanya Santha vs. UoI case directly addresses the issue of discrimination against DNTs.  However, while the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is historically relevant to the categorization of DNTs, salt trading is just one example of many occupations among DNTs; it's not the defining characteristic connected to the Act's historical impact.  The question tests knowledge about the characteristics and historical context of DNTs, along with the legal cases related to their rights. The distractor in option 2 uses a related but not directly linked fact, demanding precise understanding to avoid falling for the trap. The correct answer requires a nuanced understanding of the socio-historical background and contemporary legal battles concerning DNTs in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                          :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                 :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                  :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                              :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                          :   Tamil Nadu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are indeed found in Chhattisgarh, and Maria Gonds reside in Maharashtra.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Paudi Bhuyans are a tribe of Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a tribe of Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  Finally, the Dongria Kondhs are found in Odisha, not Tamil Nadu.  This question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their geographical distribution within India.  Understanding the geographical distribution of various tribal groups is crucial for comprehending India's diverse demographic landscape and the challenges faced by these communities in terms of development and preservation of their unique cultural heritage. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of tribal demographics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                         Focus Area
1. PMGKAY                                  :   Providing free food grains to the elderly
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana    :   Financial assistance for pregnant women
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :   Improving sanitation in rural areas
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013:   Ensuring food security for all citizens

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) focuses on providing financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers, and the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, aims to ensure food security for a significant portion of the Indian population by providing subsidized food grains.  Option (a) is incorrect because PMGKAY provides free food grains to a larger section of the poor population, not just the elderly. Option (c) is incorrect because Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on improving nutrition and healthcare for children, not sanitation. The question tests the candidate's understanding of various government schemes related to food security and nutrition in India.  A thorough knowledge of these schemes is essential for analyzing government policies aimed at poverty reduction and social welfare. The inclusion of plausible distractors highlights the importance of precise knowledge in differentiating between similar-sounding schemes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Primary Focus
1. GAIN                                      :   Combating malnutrition globally
2. UNICEF                                    :   Promoting women's rights
3. FAO                                       :   Improving agricultural practices globally
4. WFP                                       :  Providing emergency food assistance
5. UNHRC                                     :   Protecting human rights internationally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) focuses on combating malnutrition globally, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) works on improving agricultural practices worldwide, WFP (World Food Programme) provides emergency food assistance, and UNHRC (UN Human Rights Council) protects human rights internationally.  UNICEF's primary focus is on children's rights and well-being, not solely on women's rights. Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the primary focus of the listed organizations.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various international organizations and their mandates.  Knowledge of these organizations is crucial for understanding global efforts in areas such as nutrition, food security, agriculture, and human rights. The incorrect options highlight the need for precise understanding of each organization's specific goals and functions, rather than relying on general knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                 Provision
1. Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                :   Defines ‘habitat’ as customary habitat in reserved and protected forests
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                   :   Repealed in 1952, denotified ‘criminal tribes’
3.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:   Grants individual rights to land
4.  Habitual Offenders Act                     :   Categorizes individuals with multiple convictions as a threat to society

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  The FRA, 2006, does define 'habitat' as encompassing customary habitat in reserved and protected forests for specific tribal groups.  The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was indeed repealed in 1952, and the 'criminal tribes' were denotified.  The Habitual Offenders Act does categorize individuals with multiple convictions as potentially dangerous to society. However, the FRA, 2006, grants community rights to forest resources, including habitat rights, but not necessarily individual land rights as stated in option (b). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are accurately matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of crucial legislation related to tribal rights and criminal justice in India. Understanding these acts is vital for analyzing the legal framework governing the rights and protection of vulnerable groups.  The inclusion of distractors highlights the importance of precise knowledge of legal terminology and provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                     Key Feature
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                  :   Focuses solely on child malnutrition
2. Food Waste Index Report 2024                   :   Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:  Examines financing for food security and nutrition
4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)             :   Produced by the World Health Organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The Food Waste Index Report 2024 indeed tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, accurately examines financing for food security and nutrition.  However, the GHI 2024 considers multiple indicators of hunger beyond just child malnutrition (undernourishment, child wasting, child stunting, and child mortality), and the GRFC is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not the World Health Organization.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various reports and indices related to food security and nutrition.  Familiarity with these reports is crucial for analyzing global and national trends in hunger, malnutrition, and food waste.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar reports and their specific focuses.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Index
1. Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe      :   Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024
2. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) :   Global Gender Gap Report 2024
3. World Economic Forum (WEF)                 :   Travel and Tourism Development Index (TTDI)
4. World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) :   Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024
5. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)                   :   National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, two non-governmental organizations based in Ireland and Germany, respectively.  The Global Innovation Index (GII) 2024 is published by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). These two pairings are accurate.  Option (b) is incorrect because the World Economic Forum (WEF) publishes the Global Gender Gap Report, not the TTDI. The TTDI is also a biennial, not annual report. Option (c) is incorrect as UNDP publishes the Gender Inequality Index (GII), not the Global Gender Gap Report.  Option (d) is incorrect because QS publishes the QS World University Rankings, not NIRF. The NIRF is an Indian ranking system managed by the Ministry of Education. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Understanding the specific organizations responsible for different indices is crucial for comprehending global development trends and rankings.


**2. With reference to global indices related to development, consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                         Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)              :   Benchmarks gender parity across four key dimensions
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII)                 :   Ranges from 0 to 1, with 0 representing gender equality
3. Global Hunger Index (GHI)                     :   Measures hunger levels in countries, with a score of 18.3 being "moderate"
4. Asia Power Index                             :   Evaluates 27 countries across the Asia-Pacific region
5. Food Waste Index (FWI)                        :   Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels globally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The GGGI indeed benchmarks gender parity across four key dimensions. The GII accurately uses a scale of 0 to 1 to represent gender inequality. The GHI correctly measures hunger levels and classifies a score of 18.3 as moderate.  The Asia Power Index correctly evaluates 27 Asia-Pacific countries. Finally, the FWI accurately tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels worldwide.  Understanding the features of these indices is essential for analyzing global trends and development challenges. Each index provides a specific lens through which progress or setbacks in key areas can be assessed.  The comprehensive nature of these pairings demonstrates a strong understanding of various global development indicators.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All of the above except 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is correctly attributed to the WEF, and the GII 2022 is correctly linked to the UNDP. The Alliance for Global Good is indeed a collaborative initiative involving the WEF and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Option (b) incorrectly includes the GHI, which is not a gender equality report. Option (c) incorrectly includes NIRF, which is an educational ranking, not a gender equality report. Option (d) is incorrect because all the pairs except 4 are correctly matched.  Understanding the different reports and their publishers is crucial for analyzing trends in gender equality globally.  The correct answer demonstrates a strong grasp of the key reports and organizations involved in monitoring and promoting gender equality.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ministry of Women and Child Development launched Aadharshila, a National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children aged 3 to 6 years.  Aadharshila is a detailed 48-week curriculum incorporating a weekly play calendar designed for learning in anganwadis. The curriculum includes an age-appropriate screening tool for children with disabilities.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because Aadharshila's age range is 3-6 years, not 3-18 years.


**4.  With reference to the  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                                      Source of Funding
    1.  Focuses on saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure :  PM-JANMAN
    2.  Covers approximately 63,000 villages              :  DAPST grants

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  It focuses on addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  The scheme is funded from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The scheme covers around 63,000 villages.  It is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader.  Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 1 incorrectly states that PM-JANMAN is the funding source, and pair 3 incorrectly links the scheme's naming to the Ministry of Tourism.


**5. With reference to the  Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                          Key Feature

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008. The Accessible India Campaign was launched in 2015. The Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme is a welfare scheme but the provided text doesn't explicitly state that it aims to provide 5% reservation in government jobs. While the government may incentivize private sector employers to employ 5% PwDs, this is not the primary aim of DDRS.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect because it misrepresents the scheme's focus.


**6. With reference to the  denotiifed tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Commission                                      Key Provision/Finding
    1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         : Repealed in 1949
    2. Renke Commission (2008)                           : Identified nearly 1,500 nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The National Board of Accreditation (NBA) is indeed the implementing agency for the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WHO. Pair 2 is also incorrect; the World Health Organization (WHO) has its membership, not Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  Hence, only option (c) is the accurate response.


**4. With reference to initiatives for Persons with Disabilities (PwDs), consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Legislation                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. National Policy for PwDs 2006                     :  Mandates the appointment of limited guardianship for PwDs unable to make legally binding decisions.
2.  RPwD Act, 2016                                  :  Includes provisions for 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
3. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) :  Focuses on making quality education affordable and accessible to PwDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The National Policy for PwDs 2006 includes provisions for limited guardianship for PwDs who require assistance in making legally binding decisions.  The RPwD Act, 2016, incorporates measures for reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions and government jobs for PwDs.  Pair 3 is incorrect; while the Accessible India Campaign aims to improve accessibility for PwDs, its primary focus isn't specifically on making education affordable and accessible, though it contributes indirectly. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative under ANRF                                     Description/Focus
1. Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) : Establishes world-class research centers with substantial funding support
2. Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)   : Pairs universities with established institutions for mentorship
3. ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)                         : Supports priority-driven research in areas like EV mobility and advanced materials

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) under ANRF focuses on supporting priority-driven, solution-focused research in key areas. The ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) aims to establish world-class research centers with substantial funding. Pair 1 is incorrect; PAIR is the initiative that pairs universities for mentorship, not ACE. Therefore, the correct option is (d).


**6.  With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Finding/Indicator                                    Value/Description
1. World’s GHI score                                   :  27.3, falling under "serious" category
2. India's GHI score                                    : 18.3, considered moderate in severity of hunger
3. Percentage of India's population with undernourishment :  13.7%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The GHI report indicates that 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment. Pair 1 is incorrect; the world's GHI score is 18.3, not India's. Pair 2 is incorrect; India's GHI score is 27.3, falling under the "serious" category, not the world's score.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct.


**7. With reference to the  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation Feature                                   Description
1. Eligibility Criteria for Foreign Universities            : Ranked in global top 500 overall or in relevant subject areas
2. Campus Establishment Timeframe                       :  Within 5 years from the date of issue of LoI
3. Approval Process                                      : UGC grants in-principal approval and issues a Letter of Intent (LoI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Foreign universities must meet the eligibility criteria of being ranked in the global top 500, and UGC follows a two-step approval process: in-principal approval followed by an LoI. Pair 2 is incorrect; the timeframe for setting up campuses is within 2 years, not 5. Therefore, only option (a) is correct.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities over 5 years.
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)      :  Established under the ANRF Act 2023, aiming to foster research and innovation.
3.  Aadharshila                                            : A National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children aged 3-6.
4.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme : Aims for comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims to uplift the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities across India through a multi-pronged approach involving various ministries and a 5-year timeframe. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act 2023, and its core objective is to cultivate a strong research and innovation ecosystem within the country. Aadharshila is correctly identified as the National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) designed for children aged 3-6, focusing on holistic development. The "Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)" scheme accurately reflects its goal of comprehensive socio-economic progress for PVTGs while safeguarding their cultural identity.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the correct answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                    Provision/Impact
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Entered into force in 2008, with India as a signatory.
2. Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                         : Defines "habitat" as an area encompassing customary and other habitats in reserved and protected forests.
3.  Habitual Offenders Act                             :  Categorizes individuals with multiple criminal convictions as a danger to society (subject to state-level variations).
4. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                           : Repealed in 1949, subsequently leading to the denotification of 'criminal tribes' in 1952.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the legislation and their key features or impacts. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) indeed came into force in 2008, and India is among its signatories, demonstrating a commitment to disability rights. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, specifically defines "habitat" in relation to the rights of tribal communities residing in forest areas. The Habitual Offenders Act, although varying across states, functions as described: categorizing repeat offenders as potential threats to society. Finally, the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is accurately portrayed as repealed in 1949, followed by the denotification of the designated groups in 1952.  The options present no inaccuracies or misleading information, making all four pairs correct.


**3. With reference to Government Schemes and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                 Funding Source/Mechanism
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants.
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)      : ₹50,000 crore (₹14,000 crore from Centre and ₹36,000 crore from private sources).
3.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) :  Not specified in provided text.
4. Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)   : Not specified in provided text.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the first two pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text. PM-JUGA's funding is explicitly stated to come from existing DAPST grants. Similarly, the ANRF's funding source and amount are clearly detailed in the text.  However, the funding mechanisms for the Accessible India Campaign and the Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme are not described in the given source material, making options (c) and (d) incorrect.  Option (a) is also incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair involving ANRF funding. Therefore, only option (b) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to Tribal Communities and their Rights, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                     Specific Right/Recognition
1.  Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes : Approved Habitat Rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.
2.  Reang community                             : Requested official recognition for their language, Kaubru.
3.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                   :  Suffered from caste-based discrimination in prisons, as highlighted in the Sukanya Santha vs. UoI case.
4.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Identified based on the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee (1960-61).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes have indeed been granted Habitat Rights under the provisions of the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The Reang community's request for official recognition of their language, Kaubru, is also a fact mentioned in the text.  The Supreme Court case of Sukanya Santha vs. UoI highlighted the issue of caste-based discrimination against DNTs within prisons.  Finally, the identification of PVTGs is directly linked to the recommendations of the Dhebar Committee.  There are no inaccuracies in any of the pairings, making option (c) the correct answer.


**5.  With reference to Nutrition and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Focus/Objective
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024               :  Ranks countries based on hunger levels, with India falling under the "serious" category.
2. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provides free food grains to a large segment of the poor population.
3.  Poshan 2.0                                   : Aims to bridge the gap between recommended dietary allowance and average daily intake.
4. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana           : Provides financial assistance and nutritional support to registered women upon the birth of their first child.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are accurately matched. The GHI 2024 report indeed ranks countries based on hunger levels and places India in the "serious" category.  PMGKAY is correctly described as a program providing free food grains to a significant portion of the impoverished population.  Poshan 2.0 aims to address nutritional deficiencies by focusing on bridging the gap between recommended and actual dietary intake.  Finally, the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana offers financial and nutritional assistance to women after the birth of their first child.  The options offer no contradictory information, leading to option (d) as the correct response.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Convention/Framework        Focus Area
1. Biwako Millennium Framework            :  Disability Rights
2. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Inclusive Society
3. Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region :  Barrier-free Environment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Biwako Millennium Framework, adopted in 2000, focuses on creating an inclusive, barrier-free, and rights-based society for people with disabilities in the Asia-Pacific region.  It lays the groundwork for broader disability rights implementation. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, is a comprehensive international human rights treaty aimed at promoting, protecting, and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  Its objective directly addresses inclusion and equal rights. The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region complements the UN-CRPD by specifically addressing the Asia-Pacific context.  All three instruments, while distinct, share the common goal of improving the lives and opportunities of people with disabilities, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit crucial elements of the comprehensive approach to disability rights embodied in these international agreements.  Each addresses a facet of disability inclusion but their combined effect is more impactful than any single instrument.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative      Primary Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Skill Development for Scheduled Castes
2.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) : Funding for Tribal Welfare Initiatives
3.  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) :  Providing Pucca Houses to Eligible Households

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, encompassing various aspects like infrastructure development, health, education, and livelihood enhancement.  While skill development is a component, it's not the *primary* objective.  The Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) is a crucial funding mechanism for tribal welfare initiatives, providing financial resources for various programs aimed at improving the lives of Scheduled Tribes.  Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) focuses on providing pucca houses to eligible rural households, including those belonging to Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct option. Option (a) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's primary focus is broader than just skill development. Option (c) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's primary objective encompasses more than just housing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Key Provision
1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                     :  Repealed in 1949
2.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                    :  Grants Habitat Rights to PVTGs
3.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016 :  Defines "Person with disability"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, which categorized certain communities as "criminal tribes," was indeed repealed in 1949, reflecting a shift away from discriminatory legislation. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), explicitly grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), recognizing their traditional connection to forest lands. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities (RPwD) Act, 2016, provides a comprehensive definition of "person with disability," encompassing various types of impairments and promoting their inclusion in society. Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the accurately matched pairs.  The question tests the understanding of key legislation concerning marginalized communities in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Function
1.  UNHCR                                        :  Assists Refugees
2.  International Organization for Migration (IOM) :  Manages Migration
3.  UNESCAP                                      :  Focuses on Asia-Pacific Economic and Social Issues

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is the UN agency mandated to protect refugees, forcibly displaced communities, and stateless people. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) is an intergovernmental organization that works in the field of migration, assisting both migrants and governments in managing migration flows.  The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) is a regional commission of the UN that focuses on economic and social development issues within the Asia-Pacific region.  All three pairs accurately reflect the core mandates of these organizations.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not represent the full range of accurate pairings. The question assesses knowledge of key international organizations and their roles in global affairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                       State/Region Primarily Associated
1.  Koraga                                            :  Kerala
2.  Juang                                             :  Odisha
3.  Siddi                                             :  Gujarat and Karnataka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the Koraga community is present in Kerala, their primary presence is in Karnataka and Dakshina Kannada. The Juang tribe is primarily found in Odisha. The Siddi community has a significant presence in both Gujarat and Karnataka.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Option (a) is incorrect because the Koraga's primary association is not with Kerala. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct pair 1. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the partially correct pair 1.  This question tests knowledge of the geographical distribution of different tribal groups in India.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   National Curriculum/Initiative                       Age Group/Focus
1. Aadharshila                                        :  Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for Children aged 3-6 years
2.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                           :  School Education
3.  PM-SHRI Schools                                   :  School Infrastructure Upgradation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aadharshila is a national curriculum specifically designed for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for children aged 3-6 years.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan is a comprehensive program for school education, covering various aspects from primary to secondary levels. PM-SHRI Schools focuses on the infrastructure upgradation of schools.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the accurately matched pairs.  The question tests familiarity with key educational initiatives in India.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Research Initiative under ANRF                      Focus Area

2.  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) :  Solution-focused Research in Priority Areas
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)                   :  Establishment of World-class Research Centers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) initiative under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to pair universities with established institutions for mentorship and collaboration, thereby fostering research capabilities. The Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) focuses on supporting research in priority areas like EV mobility, advanced materials, and healthcare technology.  ANRF Centres of Excellence (ACE) are designed to establish world-class research centers with substantial funding.  All three pairs accurately reflect the focus areas of these initiatives.  Therefore, option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question assesses knowledge of recent developments in India's research and innovation landscape.




**1. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                 Custodian Organization
1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                       :   World Food Programme
2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                       :   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)       :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024 is indeed produced by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.  The correct pairing of FWI and UNEP is crucial in understanding the international effort to monitor and reduce food waste.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), produced annually, is correctly linked to the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  The FSIN plays a vital role in data collection and analysis related to food crises globally, contributing to effective responses and policy-making. However, the Food Loss Index (FLI) is incorrectly paired with the World Food Programme (WFP). While WFP is deeply involved in combating hunger and food insecurity, the custodian of the FLI is the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO).  This highlights the importance of understanding the specific roles of different UN agencies in addressing global food security challenges.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the misattribution of the FLI custodian.


**2. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Targeted Entities/Systems
1. NQAS Assessment                             :   Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM)
2. Spot Food License Initiative                 :   Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS)
3. Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) :   National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Spot Food License Initiative correctly utilizes the pan-India IT platform, Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS), for streamlined licensing. This initiative significantly improves the efficiency and accessibility of food licensing procedures, aligning with the objective of simplifying regulatory processes. The Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) are indeed part of the NQAS assessment program, which evaluates the quality and standards of these facilities. This assessment is crucial for ensuring the effectiveness and reliability of public health services. However, the NQAS assessment is not directly linked to the Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM).  While both initiatives aim to improve healthcare, their scopes and functionalities are distinct. ABDM is a digital health infrastructure, whereas NQAS focuses on quality assurance for specific health facilities. This distinction makes option (a), (b) and (d) incorrect.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings of the initiatives with their respective targets.


**3. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Report                       Focus Area/Goal
1. GAIN Report ‘The Case for Investment…’   :   Reducing gender inequalities in the agri-food sector
2. GAIN                                      :   Combating malnutrition caused by nutrient deficiencies
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition Report:   Tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN's report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," accurately focuses on reducing gender inequalities within the agri-food sector.  This highlights GAIN's commitment to addressing both nutritional challenges and social equity. GAIN's core mission is to combat malnutrition stemming from insufficient nutrients in diets.  This is a key aspect of their work, involving public-private partnerships to enhance access to essential nutrients.  However, the State of Food Security and Nutrition Report does *not* primarily focus on tracking global food waste. While food waste is a significant concern addressed in various reports, the State of Food Security and Nutrition Report has a broader mandate encompassing hunger, food insecurity, and various forms of malnutrition. Therefore, option (c) and (d) are incorrect. Option (a) is also incorrect as it only includes the correct pairing of the GAIN report and its focus.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Category                        Top Ranked Institution in 2024
1. Overall Category                         :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
2. Universities Category                    :   Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras
3. Open Universities Category              :   IGNOU


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings correctly place IGNOU as the top-ranked institution in the Open Universities category. This reflects IGNOU's significant contribution to distance education and its strong performance according to NIRF parameters.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. IIT Madras topped the Overall category, not IISc Bangalore.  IISc Bangalore consistently ranks highly but in the Universities category, not the overall category.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of these mismatches.  Option (c) accurately reflects the only correct pairing provided.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 and Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                               Country Ranking (Approximate)
1. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) 2024       :   India ranked 129th
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022         :   India ranked 108th
3. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) 2024       :   Iceland ranked 1st


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 accurately reflects India's ranking around 129th out of 146 countries. This ranking highlights the persistent gender gap in India across various dimensions. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 also correctly shows India's ranking around 108th out of 193 countries.  The GII provides a different perspective on gender inequality, focusing on reproductive health, empowerment, and economic opportunities.  Iceland's ranking as one of the top countries in the Global Gender Gap Index 2024 is also accurate, showcasing its progress in gender equality. All three pairings are accurate reflections of the respective reports and their findings. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not encompass all correctly matched pairs.


**6.  With reference to initiatives tackling hunger, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Focus/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY):  Providing nutritional support to pregnant women
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0        :  Supplementary nutrition for bridging dietary gaps
3. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana       :  Providing free food grains to the poor


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 accurately focus on providing supplementary nutrition to address the gap between recommended dietary allowances and actual intake. This initiative is crucial for improving the nutritional status of vulnerable populations, especially children and pregnant women. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) correctly aims to provide financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers.  This initiative plays a vital role in maternal and child health. However, Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is incorrectly linked to providing nutritional support to pregnant women. While PMGKAY does aim to alleviate hunger and food insecurity, its primary focus is on providing free food grains to the poor and vulnerable sections of society.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the misattribution of PMGKAY's objective.


**7. With reference to organizations involved in global food security, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Role/Mandate
1. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :   Custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI)
2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)    :   Providing food aid and promoting food security globally
3. International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD): Contributing to the State of Food Security and Nutrition Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) accurately plays a crucial role in providing food aid and promoting global food security.  Its mandate extends to various aspects of agriculture, nutrition, and rural development, making it a key player in addressing global hunger. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) correctly contributes to the State of Food Security and Nutrition Report. IFAD's focus on rural development and agricultural investment aligns with the report's mandate.  However, the World Food Programme (WFP) is incorrectly paired with being the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI). The custodian of the FLI is actually the FAO.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of this misattribution.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**8. With reference to the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, consider the following pairs:**

   Alliance/Initiative                       Key Feature/Goal
1. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty:   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2023
2. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty:   Focuses solely on eradicating hunger
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition             :   Commits countries to eradicating hunger and malnutrition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was indeed launched at a G20 Leaders’ Summit, although the year might be slightly off.  The precise year is less important than the fact of its launch within a G20 context, reflecting its international collaboration focus. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition correctly commits countries to eradicating hunger and all forms of malnutrition, underscoring the comprehensive nature of its goals.  However, the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty does *not* focus solely on eradicating hunger. Its aims are broader, encompassing poverty reduction and inequality reduction alongside hunger eradication, reflecting the interconnectedness of these global challenges.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate description of the Alliance's scope.


**9. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Convention/Initiative                        Key Aspect/Goal
1. UN-CRPD                                     :   Adopted in 2007
2. Biwako Millennium Framework                 :   Working towards an inclusive, barrier-free society
3. Declaration on the Full Participation…        :   Specific to the Asia-Pacific region


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biwako Millennium Framework accurately works towards creating an inclusive and barrier-free society for persons with disabilities. This framework is significant in promoting the rights and participation of individuals with disabilities. The Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region correctly focuses specifically on the Asia-Pacific region, reflecting regional efforts to advance disability rights. However, the UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006, not 2007.  While the exact year is a detail, the adoption year is a key factual element. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy regarding the UN-CRPD adoption year.


**10. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                          Key Feature/Objective
1. PM-JUGA                                    :   Named after Birsa Munda
2. PM-JANMAN                                  :   Directly informs the design of PM-JUGA
3. Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST):  Funding source for PM-JUGA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, reflecting the scheme's focus on tribal communities and acknowledging his historical significance. This naming choice carries symbolic weight, connecting the initiative to a leader who championed tribal rights.  The learnings and successes from PM-JANMAN directly informed the design and implementation of PM-JUGA. This showcases a strategy of building upon previous initiatives to enhance effectiveness. DAPST grants are a significant funding source for PM-JUGA, highlighting the convergence of resources to achieve the scheme's objectives.  All three pairings accurately reflect key aspects of the PM-JUGA initiative and its context.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Focus Area
1. PM-JUGA                                    :   Sustainable Livelihoods for Forest Right Holders
2. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                 :   Providing Pucca Houses to Eligible Tribal Households
3. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana       :   Skill Development for Tribal Youth
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, with a special emphasis on sustainable livelihoods for those holding Forest Rights Act (FRA) pattas.  This directly aligns with the description provided in the first pair.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) aims to provide pucca houses to eligible rural households, including tribal communities, making the second pair correct. However, the Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana is a maternity benefit scheme providing financial assistance to pregnant women and lactating mothers, not skill development for tribal youth.  Therefore, option (b) is the only accurate choice. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of PM Awaas Yojana. Option (c) and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pair related to Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding government schemes with distinct objectives.  Understanding the nuanced goals of each program is crucial for correct matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                         State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                        :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                               :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                :   Chhattisgarh
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that the Kamars are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) in Chhattisgarh, and the Bharias are a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  However, the Paudi Bhuyans are listed as a PVTG in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. This makes pair 1 incorrect. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings, while options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing. The question assesses factual recall of geographical distribution of specific tribal groups, demanding precise knowledge beyond general awareness of PVTGs.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as placing Paudi Bhuyans in a neighboring state, increases the difficulty level.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                 Implementing Ministry/Organization
1.  National Health Mission                    :   Establishment of Tribal Home Stays
2.  Swadesh Darshan                           :   Coverage of Immunization through Mobile Medical Units
3.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                  :   Improving Infrastructure of Government Residential Schools/Hostels
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that the National Health Mission is involved in the coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units.  The improvement of infrastructure in government residential schools and hostels is directly linked to the Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  However, the promotion of Tribal Home Stays is explicitly linked to the Ministry of Tourism under the Swadesh Darshan scheme, not the National Health Mission.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating the necessity for precise knowledge of the implementing agencies for various government schemes. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the inter-ministerial coordination in the implementation of development programs targeting tribal communities.  The distractor in pair 1 is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the specific roles of different ministries.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Act                                    Key Feature
1. Forest Rights Act (FRA)                         :   Recognizes habitat rights for PVTGs
2.  Development of PVTGs Scheme                   :   100% Central assistance
3.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013      :   Provision of Supplementary Nutrition
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act (FRA) explicitly defines and provides for habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), making the first pair correct. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is clearly stated to provide 100% central funding assistance, thus the second pair is correct.  However, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, focuses on the right to food and food security, not on supplementary nutrition, which is addressed through other schemes like Poshan Abhiyan.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge about the specific features of various government schemes. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between the key objectives of different welfare programs.  The distractor in pair 3 is crucial in testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of food security policies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Objective/Focus
1.  GAIN                                        :   Tackling malnutrition through public-private partnerships
2.  UNICEF                                      :   Promoting, protecting, and ensuring the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for persons with disabilities
3.  UN-CRPD                                    :   Supporting public-private partnerships to increase access to missing nutrients in diets
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is accurately described in pair 1 as focusing on tackling malnutrition through the use of public-private partnerships.  The UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) works on a wide range of children's issues, including child rights. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is specifically designed to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, making the second pair correct. However, the description in pair 3 is incorrect; it incorrectly attributes the focus on public-private partnerships to increase access to missing nutrients in diets to UN-CRPD, which is the focus of GAIN. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair 3. The question assesses factual recall of the objectives of various international organizations working in the field of health and social welfare and requires a precise understanding of their mandates.  The distractor in pair 3 is designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

    Indicator                                     Description/Measurement
1.  Retail Inflation                             :   Measured by the Wholesale Price Index (WPI)
2.  Consumer Price Index (CPI)                   :   Tracks changes in prices paid by producers
3.  Global Hunger Index (GHI)                    :   Released by the World Bank
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  This question is incorrect as framed.  The provided text states that retail inflation is measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), not the Wholesale Price Index (WPI).  Additionally, CPI tracks changes in prices paid by *consumers*, not producers. Finally, the GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Bank. Therefore, *none* of the pairs are correctly matched.  However, since the question requires selecting from the provided options, and there is no "none" option, there is no correct answer within the constraints of the original prompt.  The question needs to be revised to reflect the accurate information from the text.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

    Research Initiative                          Focus Area
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) :   Establishment of world-class research centers
2.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas)      :   Mentorship for universities at a nascent stage of research
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)               :   Priority-driven research in areas like EV mobility and solar cells
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description of PAIR accurately reflects its objective of pairing universities at a nascent stage of research with top-tier institutions for mentorship. MAHA is correctly paired with its focus on priority-driven research in high-impact areas like EV mobility and solar cells. However, the establishment of world-class research centers is the objective of ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE), not PAIR. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing. This question tests the ability to differentiate between closely related research initiatives under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).  The distractor in pair 1 tests the candidate's in-depth understanding of the individual components of ANRF's research strategy.



**1. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State          PVTG
1. Odisha        :  Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh
2. Madhya Pradesh:  Maria Gond
3. Chhattisgarh  :  Bharias
4. Maharashtra   :  Kamars and Baigas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair, Odisha and Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh, is correctly matched.  The Paudi Bhuyans of Deogarh are indeed recognised as a PVTG in Odisha.  The other pairings are incorrect.  The Maria Gond tribe is found in states like Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, not Madhya Pradesh. The Bharias are a PVTG in Madhya Pradesh, not Chhattisgarh.  Finally, the Kamars and Baigas are PVTGs in Chhattisgarh, not Maharashtra. This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific PVTGs across different Indian states, highlighting the importance of understanding the nuances of tribal demographics within the Indian context for UPSC preparation.  Incorrect options serve as strong distractors because they involve tribes that *are* PVTGs, but in different states than those indicated in the options. This necessitates precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Goal             Specific Intervention
1. Developing Enabling Infrastructure   :   Tribal Home Stays
2. Promotion of Economic Empowerment:  Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
3. Universalization of Access to Education:  Access to Ayushman Bharat Card
4. Healthy Lives and Dignified Ageing    :   Coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The PM-JUGA's goal of developing enabling infrastructure includes interventions like promoting Tribal Home Stays to leverage tourism potential. Similarly, the goal of ensuring healthy lives and dignified aging involves improving healthcare access through mobile medical units, especially in remote areas. The other pairs are mismatched.  Improving school infrastructure falls under education, not economic empowerment. Access to Ayushman Bharat cards, while beneficial, is primarily a healthcare initiative related to Goal 4, not education.  This question tests the understanding of the integrated and multi-pronged approach of PM-JUGA, emphasizing the linkage between different government schemes and their alignment with specific developmental goals.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors by combining elements from different goals, requiring candidates to possess a detailed understanding of the scheme's components.


**3. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), consider the following pairs:**

   Term              Definition/Characteristic
1. Habitat           :   Area comprising customary habitat in reserved and protected forests of forest dwelling STs
2. Habitat Rights   :   Accorded after consultation with only government officials
3. PVTG identification criteria:  High literacy rates
4. FRA Patta Holders:   Specifically excluded from Sustainable Livelihood schemes under PM-JUGA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first pair is correctly matched. The FRA accurately defines "habitat" as encompassing customary and other habitats within reserved and protected forests for specific tribal groups.  The other pairings are incorrect.  Habitat rights are accorded after consultations with *various* stakeholders, not just government officials. PVTG identification criteria explicitly include *extremely low* literacy rates, not high ones.  Furthermore, FRA patta holders are a *key focus* of the Sustainable Livelihood schemes under PM-JUGA, not excluded from them. The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the FRA and related concepts, including the definition of key terms and the procedures involved in implementing the act. The incorrect options include plausible but factually wrong statements about the act's provisions and the characteristics of PVTGs, making it a challenging question that demands precise knowledge.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Category               Top Ranked Institution in 2024
1. Overall                :   IISC Bangalore
2. Universities           :   IIT Madras
3. Open Universities      :   Not mentioned in provided text
4. State Public Universities:  Not mentioned in provided text


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched.  IIT Madras topped the overall category in NIRF 2024.  The other pairings are incorrect. IISC Bangalore topped the Universities category, not the overall category.  The provided text does not specify the top-ranked institutions for Open Universities or State Public Universities in 2024; therefore, any pairing with these categories would be incorrect. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the NIRF rankings and their understanding of the different categories included in the framework. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge of the 2024 NIRF ranking results to answer correctly.  It highlights the importance of staying updated on current affairs related to education and ranking systems in India.


**5. With reference to the  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Funding Source           Characteristic
1. DAPST grants             :   100% Central assistance
2. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) :   Funds allocated under PM-JUGA
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes:  Source of funding for PM-JUGA
4. Private Sources            :  Significant contribution to overall funding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are indeed a source of funding for PM-JUGA.  The other pairings are incorrect. While DAPST grants are used for tribal development, they are not exclusively 100% centrally funded; the funding model can vary. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), though relevant to PM-JUGA's goals, is a separate scheme and its funds are not directly allocated *under* PM-JUGA.  The provided text does not mention significant private sector funding for PM-JUGA. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the financial mechanisms behind PM-JUGA and its relationship with other government schemes. The incorrect options introduce plausible but factually inaccurate relationships between funding sources and the scheme, thereby testing the candidates' precise knowledge of the scheme's funding structure.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision
1. Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 : Prohibits employment of children below 10 years in all occupations
2. Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006       : Sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 20 for men
3. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 :  Mandates the establishment of Special Courts for child marriage cases
4. Maternity Benefit Act, 1961                    : Provides 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for women with one surviving child


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits the employment of children below 14 years in all occupations and adolescents (14-18 years) in hazardous occupations.  Option 1 incorrectly states the age limit as 10 years.  The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, correctly sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 21 for men. Option 2 incorrectly states the age for men as 20. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, addresses the care and protection of children at risk, but doesn't specifically mandate the establishment of Special Courts for child marriage cases; this is a judicial interpretation and implementation rather than a direct statutory provision.  The Maternity Benefit Act, 1961, as amended, provides 26 weeks of paid maternity leave for women with less than two surviving children. Option 4 is incorrect regarding the number of surviving children.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 contain partially correct information, though with inaccuracies. The other options present incorrect pairings due to misinterpretations or factual errors concerning the specific provisions of the Acts.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in statements related to legislation.


**2. With reference to legal frameworks concerning children in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Specific Focus
1. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (2015)     : Preventing child labour
2. National Action Plan to Prevent Child Marriage : Providing emergency outreach services to victims of child marriage
3. CHILDLINE (1098)                           :  Comprehensive framework for supporting girls at risk of early marriage
4. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Care and protection of children at imminent risk of marriage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme aims to address the issue of the declining child sex ratio and promote the education and empowerment of girls, not specifically child labour. Option 1 is incorrect.  The National Action Plan to Prevent Child Marriage provides a comprehensive framework to support girls at risk, not solely emergency outreach services. Option 2 misrepresents the plan's focus. CHILDLINE (1098) is a 24/7 emergency service for children in crisis, including those at risk of child marriage; however, it is not a comprehensive framework in itself. Option 3 incorrectly describes its scope.  The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, explicitly addresses the care and protection of children at imminent risk of marriage, making option 4 the only correctly matched pair.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the specific objectives and functions of various government schemes and acts related to child welfare in India. It demands detailed knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment/Act                                     Specific Change/Provision
1. MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                      :  Reduced the gestational period for abortion to 18 weeks for all women
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 : Allowed commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals
3.  Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023                 :  Contains provisions related to causing the miscarriage of women
4.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Allows abortion only on grounds of rape


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, extended the gestational limit for abortion, not reduced it. Option 1 is factually incorrect.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, did not permit commercial surrogacy for foreign nationals; commercial surrogacy remains prohibited. Option 2 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, indeed contains provisions related to causing the miscarriage of women, making option 3 correct. The MTP Act, 1971, allows abortion on several grounds beyond just rape, including the health of the mother. Option 4 is an oversimplification.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about recent amendments and legal frameworks concerning reproductive rights and healthcare in India.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options tests their critical evaluation skills.


**4. With reference to the rights and welfare of persons with disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Policy                                  Specific Provision
1. The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Mandates a 2% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
2.  National Policy for PwDs, 2006             :  Introduced the concept of "limited guardianship" for PwDs
3. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) : Aims to make public transportation accessible to PwDs
4. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):  Focuses primarily on skill development for PwDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates a 5% reservation, not 2%, in government jobs for PwDs. Option 1 is incorrect.  The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, while promoting the welfare of PwDs, did not explicitly introduce the concept of "limited guardianship"; this is a later development based on the Act's principles. Option 2 is incorrect. The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) specifically focuses on making public spaces and transportation accessible to PwDs, making option 3 correct. The UN-CRPD has a broader scope than just skill development; it addresses a wide range of rights and issues concerning PwDs.  Option 4 misrepresents the convention's focus. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge about Indian legislation and international conventions concerning the rights and welfare of PwDs.  The distractor options test their understanding of the nuances of these policies and their ability to differentiate between similar initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative                      Key Feature
1.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 : Defines pandemic emergencies as communicable diseases with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Includes persons with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments.
3.  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality : Launched in Davos 2024, endorsed by the World Economic Forum (WEF), supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, indeed, underwent amendments to better define pandemic emergencies, emphasizing the geographical spread and the strain on national health systems.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) explicitly includes individuals with various long-term impairments as persons with disabilities, reflecting a comprehensive definition.  The Alliance for Global Good, a crucial initiative for gender equity and equality, aligns perfectly with its description – launched in Davos 2024, supported by key organizations, and rooted in the G20 Leaders' Declaration.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of international initiatives related to health and disability rights, crucial for the UPSC exam.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                          Key Objective/Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities.
2. National Health Accounts Estimates : Offers a detailed description of financial flows within India's health system, illustrating how funds are collected, spent, and utilized.
3.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education :  A formal mechanism to evaluate existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are accurately matched. PM-JUGA's core objective is to address crucial infrastructural and socio-economic gaps within tribal communities. The National Health Accounts Estimates provide a comprehensive financial analysis of India's healthcare system, as described.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) accurately reflects its purpose of formally evaluating prior learning acquired through various methods.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of government schemes and initiatives related to healthcare, education, and tribal welfare, all relevant topics for the UPSC examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Significant Provision
1.  97th Constitutional Amendment Act 2011 : Established the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right (Article 19).
2.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment in line with the Supreme Court’s definition in the Vishaka Judgment.
3.  The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006 : Sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 21 for men.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs represent accurate matches. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act did indeed establish the right to form cooperatives as a fundamental right. The POSH Act correctly incorporates the Supreme Court's Vishaka judgment definition of sexual harassment.  The PCMA accurately states the minimum marriage ages.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian legislation concerning social justice, women's rights, and constitutional amendments – essential for the UPSC exam.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                   Key Function/Responsibility
1.  Press Council of India (PCI)                    : Acts as a moral watchdog, ensuring press freedom from external influences.
2.  Comptroller & Auditor General (CAG) of India   : Audits all receipts and expenditure of the Government of India and state governments.
3.  Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA)       : Oversees ethical and legal adoptions in India, regulating both in-country and inter-country adoptions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair is correctly matched. The PCI's role as a guardian of press freedom and ethics is well-established. The CAG's responsibility for auditing government finances is a core constitutional function. CARA's mandate in regulating adoptions is also accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect, failing to include all correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key Indian institutions and their roles, a crucial area for the UPSC exam.  It requires factual recall and understanding of institutional functions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Body                                    Key Characteristic/Function
1.  University Grants Commission (UGC)              :  Approved a Standard Operating Protocol (SOP) for Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to offer Accelerated Degree Programmes (ADPs).
2.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) :  Ranks educational institutions based on parameters like Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.
3.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) :  Aims to foster research and innovation across the country, mobilizing significant funding from both central and private sources.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The UGC's role in approving SOPs for degree programs is accurate. NIRF's ranking methodology and parameters are correctly described. ANRF's aim to promote research and its funding model are also accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests knowledge of higher education regulatory bodies and their functions in India, a relevant topic for the UPSC exam, demanding factual recall and understanding of institutional roles.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking                                     Top Ranked Indian Institution
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025       :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
2. University Impact Rankings 2024           :   Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
3. NIRF 2024 Overall Category                :   Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras
4. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was indeed the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024.  IIT Madras also topped the Overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings for the sixth consecutive year.

Option 1 is incorrect.  While IISc Bangalore is a highly ranked Indian institution, the provided text states that in the QS World University Rankings 2025,  it was ranked in the 251-300 bracket, not the top-ranked Indian university.  The top-ranked Indian institution in QS rankings was IIT Bombay, making this pair incorrect.

Option 4 is also incorrect.  The passage clearly states that IIT Bombay was the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025.  The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 is a different ranking system altogether, and the provided text doesn't specify the top Indian institution for that ranking.  Therefore, this is a distractor designed to test knowledge of different ranking systems and their individual results.  The inclusion of IIT Bombay in this pair is a deliberate attempt to confuse the candidate.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    University Ranking System              :   Number of Performance Indicators Used
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025       :   18
2. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 :   9
3. University Impact Rankings 2024           :   Not specified in the text

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the second pair is correctly matched. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 uses 18 indicators to assess institutions.

Pair 1 is incorrect as the QS World University Rankings 2025 uses 9 performance indicators, not 18.  This is a classic distractor, playing on the similarity between two major ranking systems.

Pair 3 is incorrect because the number of performance indicators used by the University Impact Rankings 2024 is not specified in the provided text, making any answer choice referencing this pair automatically wrong. The question tests the candidate's ability to identify information that is explicitly stated versus information that can be inferred or is missing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Regulation/Policy                     :   Key Aim/Objective
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : To improve the GER in higher education
2. National Education Policy 2020        :   To facilitate the entry of higher-ranked Foreign Universities
3. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024  :   To rank educational institutions based on parameters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The National Education Policy 2020 aims to allow the entry of top world universities to open campuses in India, aligning with the second pair.  The NIRF 2024 indeed aims to rank educational institutions based on specified parameters.

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the UGC regulations aim to facilitate the entry of foreign universities, improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) is not explicitly stated as a primary aim of the regulations.  Improving GER is a broader goal of the National Education Policy, but not a specific objective of these regulations. This highlights the importance of precise understanding of policy objectives. The distractor is designed to test the understanding of the nuanced differences between the aims of different policies.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                  :   Implementing Agency/Body
1.  NIRF                                   :   National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre
2. ASMITA Project                           :   Ministry of Education
3. Project NAMAN                             :   Indian Army

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) is implemented by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with the INFLIBNET Centre. Project NAMAN was launched by the Indian Army.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The ASMITA project is implemented by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS), not the Ministry of Education directly. While the Ministry of Education launched the project, the implementation is carried out by these other bodies, making this a subtle but crucial distinction. This tests the candidate's understanding of the different roles of various government bodies in policy implementation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Convention                           :   Key Feature/Objective
1. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 : Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally
2. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005 : Aims to promote the prevention of doping in sport
3.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006       :   Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005, aims to promote the prevention of and fight against doping in sport. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, provides habitat rights to PVTGs.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is related to narcotics control, not international harmonization of anti-doping legislation.  The harmonization of anti-doping legislation is a feature of the UNESCO Convention, not the NDPS Act.  This highlights the importance of distinguishing between related but distinct legal frameworks.  This distractor tests the ability to differentiate between the focus areas of different legislation.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Prominent Feature
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Covers around 63,000 villages
2.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme:  100% Central assistance
3.  Asmita Project                                     :  Production of 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities and explicitly covers around 63,000 villages.  The Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme is a centrally sponsored scheme providing 100% central financial assistance. The Asmita Project, focused on promoting multilingualism in education, aims to produce 22,000 books across 22 scheduled languages. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of key features of different government schemes and initiatives targeting tribal welfare and educational empowerment.  Understanding the specific details of each scheme is crucial for correct matching.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                      Key Feature
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                     :  India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2.  QS World University Rankings, 2025                :  IIT Bombay ranked highest among Indian institutions
3.  University Impact Rankings 2024                    : Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham ranked highest among Indian Universities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The 2024 Global Hunger Index report placed India at 105th out of 127 countries. The 2025 QS World University Rankings listed IIT Bombay as the highest-ranked Indian institution.  The 2024 University Impact Rankings showed Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as the top-performing Indian university.  The incorrect options (a), (b), and (c) fail to capture the accuracy of all the pairings.  The question tests the ability to recall specific data points from different ranking systems and their implications for India's performance in higher education and global hunger indices.  It assesses factual recall and understanding of the significance of these rankings.



**3. With reference to higher education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                                   Prominent Feature
1.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020               :  Introduction of Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)
2.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)                :  Integration of informal learning into formal education
3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024:  IIT Madras ranked highest overall

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 introduced the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) system. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) aims to formally acknowledge and integrate knowledge and skills acquired through various learning pathways into the formal education system. The 2024 National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) rankings placed IIT Madras at the top position in the overall category. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correct pairings. This question tests the candidate's understanding of key policy initiatives and their specific features within the Indian higher education system.  It assesses factual knowledge and the ability to link policies with their outcomes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation/Convention                           Key Feature
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Adopted in 2006
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023:  Allows top 500 global universities to set up campuses
3.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport:  Aims to eliminate doping in sports

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was indeed adopted in 2006. The UGC regulations of 2023 facilitate the establishment of campuses in India by top-ranked foreign universities. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport aims to combat doping globally. The elimination of incorrect options (a), (b), and (c) hinges on understanding the specific details of each legal instrument and its objectives. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of international conventions and national regulations related to disability rights, higher education, and sports. It tests factual recall and understanding of the scope of these instruments.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                             Key Feature
1.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)   :  Mobilisation of ₹50,000 crore for 2023-2028
2.  National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS):  Prepares National Health Accounts Estimates
3.  National Board of Accreditation (NBA)              :  Implements the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) has secured funding of ₹50,000 crore for the period 2023-2028. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) is responsible for preparing the National Health Accounts Estimates.  However, pair 3 is incorrect; the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) does *not* implement the NIRF; that task falls to the Ministry of Education in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3. The question demands precise knowledge of the roles and functions of various organizations in research funding, health data analysis, and higher education ranking.  It assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding entities.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                       Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure in 10,000 tribal villages.
2.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme:  Provides 100% central assistance for activities like education and housing, excluding infrastructure development.
3. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)       :  Mobilises ₹14,000 crore from private sources for research funding.
4.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)        : Includes “Innovation” ranking in its framework since 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood.  It covers around 63,000 villages, significantly more than the 10,000 mentioned in option 1.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.

The Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme provides 100% central assistance, but the funding is used for various activities including education, housing, agricultural development, and strengthening community assets.  While infrastructure development is indirectly supported, it's not the sole focus and isn't exclusively funded by the scheme.  Option 2 is therefore incorrect.

The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to mobilize a total of ₹50,000 crore, with ₹14,000 crore coming from the central government and ₹36,000 crore from private sources.  Option 3 is incorrect.

The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) integrated "Innovation" ranking into its framework. This is a correct statement.

Therefore, only statement 4 is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to tribal communities in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Group                                      State/Region with Significant Presence
1. Paudi Bhuyans                                     Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamars                                             Odisha
3. Maria Gond                                        Chhattisgarh
4. Bharias                                           Maharashtra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paudi Bhuyans are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) primarily residing in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  Option 1 is incorrect.

The Kamars are a tribal group found in Chhattisgarh, not Odisha. Option 2 is incorrect.

The Maria Gond are a significant tribal group in Chhattisgarh and parts of Maharashtra.  This pairing is correct.

The Bharias are a PVTG primarily located in Madhya Pradesh, not Maharashtra. Option 4 is incorrect.

Therefore, only the pairing of Maria Gond with Chhattisgarh and Bharias with Madhya Pradesh are correct making option (c) the correct answer.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                     Primary Objective
1.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :  Grants habitat rights to specific tribal groups.
2.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment based on the Vishaka Judgement.
3.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Restricts the entry of foreign universities to those ranked in the global top 100.
4.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                       :  Provided legal recognition for live-in relationships.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes. This is a correct pairing.

The Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) explicitly defines sexual harassment aligning with the Supreme Court's definition in the Vishaka judgment. This is correct.

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023,  facilitate the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities, not restricting them to only the top 100.  The regulations specify that foreign higher educational institutions (FHEIs) must be ranked in the global top 500, either overall or in relevant subject areas.  This statement is incorrect.

The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, aimed to criminalize certain nomadic communities, not provide legal recognition for live-in relationships. This statement is incorrect.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to global rankings and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Initiative                                      Key Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings utilize nine performance indicators in their assessment of universities globally. This is correct.

The Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings use eighteen indicators to assess institutions across five key areas: teaching, research environment, research quality, industry engagement, and international outlook.  The statement that it is based solely on research output is incorrect.

The Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality was launched in Davos 2024 and receives support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. This pairing is correct.

The World Happiness Report ranks countries based on factors contributing to happiness; Denmark consistently ranks highly, not the least happy. This statement is incorrect.

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                                   Focus Area
1. UNHCR                                                    Protection of refugees.
2. IOM                                                       Facilitating migration.
3. UNESCAP                                                  Promoting sustainable development in the Asia-Pacific region.
4.  World Economic Forum (WEF)                             Focuses primarily on women's health, education, and enterprise.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNHCR (UN High Commissioner for Refugees) is primarily focused on protecting refugees worldwide. This is a correct pairing.

The IOM (International Organization for Migration) deals with various aspects of migration, facilitating orderly, safe, regular and responsible migration.  This pairing is correct.

UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) works on sustainable development issues within the Asia-Pacific region.  This pairing is correct.

The WEF (World Economic Forum) while involved in various global initiatives, does not primarily focus on women's health, education, and enterprise as its singular focus. Its scope is far broader. This pairing is incorrect.

Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                     Feature
1.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) : Aims to integrate informal learning into the formal education system.
2.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)       :  A platform for free exchange of ideas on technology in education.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF) :  Catalyzes research and innovation across the country.
4.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) : Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is indeed a formal mechanism designed to evaluate a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways and integrate them into the formal education system.  The National Research Foundation (NRF) is correctly paired with its aim to catalyze and expand research and innovation across India.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) stores academic credits, not the NETF. Option (c) is incorrect as ABC and NETF have different functions. Option (d) is incorrect because of the mismatched pairing of ABC and NETF.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of different initiatives in the Indian higher education landscape.


**2. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking Category                      Feature
1.  Overall Category                       :  Topped by IISC Bangalore for 9 consecutive times.
2.  Universities Category                 :  Topped by IIT Madras for 6 consecutive times.
3.  Open Universities Category             : Newly added category in 2024 rankings.
4.  Skill Universities Category            : Newly added category in 2024 rankings.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings introduced new categories for Open Universities and Skill Universities.  IIT Madras consistently topped the Overall category, and IISC Bangalore topped the Universities category. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall regarding the NIRF ranking framework and its recent changes.  The distractors use similar-sounding institutions and categories to make the question challenging.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

    ANRF Initiative                      Description
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) :  Establishes world-class research centers.
2.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas)   : Pairs universities with established institutions for mentorship.
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)      : Supports research in priority areas like EV mobility.
4.  SERB (Science and Engineering Research Board)          : Subsumed into ANRF under the ANRF Act 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The MAHA initiative focuses on supporting priority-driven research in areas such as EV mobility, while the ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) aims to establish world-class research centers.  PAIR involves pairing universities for mentorship, and SERB was indeed subsumed into ANRF. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the ANRF's key initiatives and their objectives. The distractors involve mixing up the descriptions of different initiatives to increase the difficulty level.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Goal                                     Specific Intervention
1.  Pucca houses for eligible households  :  Implementation through PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin).
2.  Skill Development                      :  Marketing support through Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs).
3.  Universalization of Access to Education: Setting up tribal hostels in schools.
4.  Healthy Lives and Dignified Ageing    :  Coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The goal of providing pucca houses is achieved through PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin).  Universalizing access to education involves setting up tribal hostels, and improving health outcomes includes using Mobile Medical Units for immunization.  Skill development, while a goal, is not directly linked to TMMCs in the way the other pairs are linked to their interventions. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the PM-JUGA scheme's goals and their implementation strategies.  The distractors involve subtly altering the connection between goals and interventions.


**5. With reference to the welfare of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Legislation/Policy                     Provision
1.  National Policy for PwDs 2006        :  Mandates the government to formulate social security programs.
2.  RPwD Act, 2016                       :  Provides for 5% reservation in government jobs.
3.  Accessible India Campaign (2015)     :  Focuses on creating a barrier-free environment.
4.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):  India is not a signatory to this convention.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for PwDs 2006 emphasizes social security measures for PwDs. The RPwD Act, 2016, includes provisions for reservation in education and employment. The Accessible India Campaign focuses on making public spaces accessible. India *is* a signatory to the UN-CRPD. This question tests knowledge of policies and legislation related to PwDs in India and their key features.  The distractor uses a false statement regarding India's status as a signatory to the UN-CRPD.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Implementing Agency
1. ASMITA Project                              :   National Book Trust, India
2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                       :   Central Hindi Directorate
3. Real-time Translation Architecture          :   Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The ASMITA project is implemented by the University Grants Commission (UGC) and Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS), not the National Book Trust, India.  The implementing agency for Bahubhasha Shabdkosh and Real-time Translation Architecture is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, and therefore, options 2 and 3 are incorrect.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of implementing agencies associated with specific initiatives, testing factual recall and analytical skills.  Distractors are created by using agencies related to language and technology, potentially confusing candidates who lack specific knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                                    Key Feature
1. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :   Focuses on combating doping in sports
2. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005 :   Harmonizes anti-doping legislation globally
3.  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Play True Campaign :   Established an anti-doping helpline


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, adopted in 2005, aims to harmonize anti-doping rules and regulations internationally. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is not directly related to sports doping, although substances covered under the act may be relevant in doping cases. The Play True campaign is indeed associated with an anti-doping helpline, but it is a campaign, not a formal act or convention. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the specific functions of different legal instruments and campaigns related to anti-doping efforts. Distractors such as incorrectly linking the NDPS Act with doping and misrepresenting the Play True campaign's nature add to the question's difficulty.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Project/Initiative                                 Primary Aim
1. Project NAMAN                                  :   Providing support to educationally backward tribal communities
2. PM-JUGA                                        :   Upgrading infrastructure of government residential schools
3. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) :   Establishing world-class research centers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to establish world-class research centers. Project NAMAN focuses on providing support and services to defense pensioners, veterans, and their families. PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, including improving the infrastructure of government residential schools, but this is not its primary aim. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government initiatives and their specific goals. The distractors include related but inaccurate aims for Project NAMAN and PM-JUGA, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge to select the correct option.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Treaty                             Key Characteristic
1.  Global Energy Efficiency Alliance (GEEA)       :   Launched at COP29 in Azerbaijan
2.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)          :   Established by WHO and FAO
3.  Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)                     :   Brokered by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) is indeed jointly established by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).  The Global Energy Efficiency Alliance's launch location is not specified in the provided context. The Indus Waters Treaty was not brokered by the IMF; it is a bilateral agreement between India and Pakistan. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall key facts related to international organizations and treaties, requiring precise knowledge to avoid the distractors. The inclusion of plausible yet incorrect information regarding the GEEA's launch and the IWT's broker increases the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Framework                          Organizing Body
1. NIRF 2024                                  :   Times Higher Education (THE)
2. QS World University Rankings, 2025         :   Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
3. University Impact Rankings 2024            :   Ministry of Education, India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The QS World University Rankings are indeed released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).  The National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 is organized by the Ministry of Education, India, not Times Higher Education (THE). The University Impact Rankings 2024 are published by THE, not the Ministry of Education, India.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of different university ranking frameworks and their respective publishers. The distractors involve confusing the organizing bodies, requiring precise knowledge to choose the correct option.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Headquarters Location
1. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty :   Brazil
2. GAIN                                          :   Geneva, Switzerland
3. World Food Programme                         :   Rome, Italy
4. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)      :   New York, USA
5. International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI): Washington D.C.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, making statement 1 incorrect regarding its headquarters.  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) is indeed headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, with an office in India. The World Food Programme (WFP), a branch of the United Nations, is headquartered in Rome, Italy, not in New York as stated in option (c).  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is also headquartered in Rome, Italy, not New York.  The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is located in Washington, D.C. Thus, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly associate headquarters with organizations, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in this type of question.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related organizations and their locations, a crucial skill for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                               Focus Area
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013    :   Combating malnutrition
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                               :   Right to food as a statutory right
3. Eat Right Movement                           :   Improving nutrition
4. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                :   Eradicating hunger and malnutrition
5. Zero Hunger Challenge                         :   Sustainable Development Goal 2


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food, not combating malnutrition directly as the primary focus. POSHAN Abhiyan and the Eat Right Movement are both primarily focused on improving nutrition, not establishing a statutory right to food.  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition. The Zero Hunger Challenge, an initiative by the UN Secretary-General, directly aims to achieve SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests the understanding of various national and international initiatives related to food security and nutrition and their specific objectives, demanding both factual recall and conceptual understanding.  The close similarity between the initiatives makes it a challenging question.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Publishing Organization
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   World Economic Forum (WEF)
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024              :   Five specialized UN agencies
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)        :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
4. Food Waste Index Report 2024                :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, is published by five specialized UN agencies (FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO), not the World Economic Forum (WEF). The Global Gender Gap Report is published by the WEF, not the UN agencies. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a joint publication of the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the knowledge of various reports and indices related to food security, nutrition, and gender equality and their respective publishing organizations, demanding accurate factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Convention/Agreement                        Objective
1. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport :   Promoting gender equality
2. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :   Harmonizing anti-doping legislation
3. Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :   Protecting the rights of persons with disabilities
4. Indus Waters Treaty (IWT)                   :   Managing water resources of the Indus River system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport aims to combat doping in sports, not promote gender equality. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) focuses on protecting the rights of persons with disabilities.  The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, aim to improve global public health preparedness and response to emergencies, not directly related to the rights of persons with disabilities. The Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) is indeed an agreement between India and Pakistan for managing the shared water resources of the Indus River system.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  This question assesses the understanding of various international conventions and agreements and their primary objectives, requiring accurate factual recall and conceptual clarity.  The distractors are designed to test the understanding of the core aims of each agreement.


**1. With reference to higher education rankings and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking/Initiative                                   Key Feature/Institution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The UGC regulations aim to bring in top-ranked foreign universities, and ANRF is indeed mobilising a significant amount of funding for research.

Pair 1 is incorrect.  While Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is a top-ranked Indian university, it achieved this ranking in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not the QS World University Rankings 2025.  The QS rankings placed IIT Bombay as the top Indian institution.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The University Impact Rankings 2024 are based on the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), not nine performance indicators.  The QS World University Rankings use multiple indicators, but the number is not nine.


**2. With reference to global hunger initiatives and reports, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Report                                      Key Feature/Organization
    1. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                     :   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024
    2. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty       :   Aims to eradicate hunger and poverty (SDGs 1 and 2)
    3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Released by the World Food Programme only
    4.  World Food Programme                           :  Established in 1961 as a food assistance branch of the United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct as pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to achieve SDGs 1 and 2, and the World Food Programme was indeed established in 1961 as a UN agency.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is a commitment to eradicating hunger and malnutrition, but it wasn't launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is released by five UN agencies: FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO; not just the World Food Programme.


**3. With reference to Acts and regulations related to women's rights and health, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                    Key Provision/Feature
    1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) :   Mandates registration of live-in relationships
    2.  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) Report   :   Provides for Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) and Local Complaints Committees (LCCs)
    3.  National Health Accounts Estimates              :  Illustrates financial flows within India’s health system
    4. Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 : Defines pandemic emergency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The NFHS reports on health data, National Health Accounts track health finance, and the IHR amendments define pandemic emergencies.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The POSH Act deals with sexual harassment at the workplace; the mandate for live-in relationship registration is part of the Uniform Civil Code in Uttarakhand.


**4. With reference to  UN conventions and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Convention/Initiative                               Key Feature/Organization
    1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :   Working towards an inclusive, barrier-free and rights-based society
    2. Biwako Millennium Framework                   : Adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008
    3. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport : Aims to promote the prevention of doping in sport
    4. Declaration on the Full Participation and Equality of People with Disabilities in the Asia-Pacific Region: Has 164 signatories including India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The UN-CRPD promotes disability rights, the UNESCO convention addresses doping in sports, and the Declaration on Full Participation focuses on disability inclusion in the Asia-Pacific region and has many signatories, including India.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Biwako Millennium Framework works towards an inclusive society; it is not the UN-CRPD itself.  The UN-CRPD was indeed adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                           Focus Area
1. PM-JUGA                                  :   Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
2. PM-JANMAN                               :   Socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities
3. National Health Mission                   :   Immunization coverage through Mobile Medical Units
4. Swadesh Darshan                           :   Promotion of Tribal Home Stays
5. Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)         :   NQAS Assessment for healthcare quality

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, including infrastructure upgrades for government residential schools and hostels.  PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan), while not explicitly named in all pairs, is referenced as a foundation for PM-JUGA, indicating a similar focus on tribal welfare. The National Health Mission's use of Mobile Medical Units for increased immunization coverage is a well-documented initiative. Swadesh Darshan, under the Ministry of Tourism, has a stated goal of promoting tribal home stays to leverage tourism potential.  Finally, the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment is specifically mentioned as being implemented for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM), linking the two.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the schemes and their respective focuses.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                  Key Provision
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Provisions for Passive Euthanasia
2. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005      :   Defines Pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread
3. Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015  :   Mandatory registration of Child Care Institutions
4.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :   Establishment of a States Parties Committee for IHR implementation


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, focuses on granting forest rights to tribal communities, not on euthanasia. The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005,  as amended,  explicitly define a pandemic emergency as involving a communicable disease with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof, exceeding national health system response capabilities. The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015, mandates the registration of all Child Care Institutions (CCIs).  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, deals with narcotics control and has no relation to the IHR's implementation committee. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pairs based on a misunderstanding of the Acts' provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024               :   India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Focus on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :   Households wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022
4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)           :   Launched by the European Union, FAO, and WFP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report indeed ranked India 105th out of 127 countries.  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, centrally focuses on financing mechanisms to eradicate hunger and malnutrition.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 highlighted the staggering statistic of over 1 billion meals wasted daily by households globally in 2022. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is correctly identified as a collaborative effort between the European Union, FAO, and WFP. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes all pairs, while option (a) and (b) incorrectly omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs. The question tests factual recall and understanding of key reports and their findings related to global food security and nutrition.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                             Role/Function
1. World Health Assembly (WHA)                 :   Decision-making body of the WHO
2.  Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)  :   Reduces gender inequalities in agri-food sector
3.  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)           :   Custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI)
4.  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) :  Launched the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Assembly (WHA) serves as the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO). The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI).  The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) aims to address the root causes of food crises, not specifically gender inequality in agri-food sectors, that is the role of GAIN.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not launched by GAIN.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pairs based on a misunderstanding of the organizations' roles and functions.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of international organizations and their specific mandates.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Project                             Description/Goal
1.  Project NAMAN                               :   Provides support services to Defence Pensioners and Veterans
2.  ASMITA Project                               :   Real-time translation architecture for multilingual education
3.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                       :   Comprehensive multilingual dictionary repository
4.  #PlayTrue Campaign                          :   Combats doping in sports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Project NAMAN (SPARSH-centric Common Service Centres) is correctly linked to providing support services to Defence Pensioners and Veterans. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is accurately described as a comprehensive multilingual dictionary repository. The #PlayTrue Campaign is a NADA initiative to raise awareness against doping in sports. However, the ASMITA Project focuses on augmenting study materials in Indian languages through translation and academic writing, not on real-time translation architecture; that is a separate initiative.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude pairs due to a misunderstanding of the initiatives' descriptions. The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Key Focus/Characteristic
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :  Tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)      :   Launched by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024             :   Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 primarily focuses on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.  While it touches upon the broader context of food security, its core theme is financial resource allocation. The Food Waste Index Report 2024, produced by UNEP and WRAP, specifically tracks global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels.  It aligns with SDG 12.3.1 (b), aiming to halve per capita global food waste. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) under the aegis of the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 3 incorrectly associate reports with the wrong key focus or characteristic.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                       Implementing Organization/Agency
1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana     :   World Food Programme
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                         :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India
3.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition          :    United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) is a Government of India initiative providing financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers.  The World Food Programme (WFP) is a separate UN agency focused on global food assistance.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a flagship program of the Indian government under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, aiming to improve nutritional outcomes. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is a global commitment by countries to tackle hunger and malnutrition, endorsed by multiple UN agencies, including FAO, WHO and UNICEF, but not solely implemented by UNICEF. Thus, only pair 2 accurately links the initiative to its implementing agency.  Pairs 1 and 3 misattribute the implementing organizations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                 Custodian Organization
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024            :   Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
2. Food Loss Index (FLI)                     :   United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024       :   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The Food Loss Index (FLI) is a key indicator under SDG 12.3 and is maintained by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not UNEP.  The Food Waste Index (FWI) is overseen by UNEP, not FAO. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Pairs 2 and 3 incorrectly attribute the custodian organizations for the FLI and FWI respectively.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Mandate/Function
1. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty :   Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in India
2. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition): Supports public-private partnerships to improve nutrition
3.  World Food Programme (WFP)                :  Combats hunger worldwide by providing food aid

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in *Brazil*, not India.  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) accurately focuses on public-private partnerships to enhance nutrition. The World Food Programme (WFP) correctly addresses global hunger through food aid. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect due to the misidentification of the launch location of the Global Alliance.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature/Objective
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013   :  Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right
2.  PMGKAY (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) : Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor
3.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006             :  Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NFSA, 2013, recognizes the right to food as a *statutory*, not fundamental, right.  PMGKAY accurately provides free food grains to a large section of the poor population. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, correctly grants habitat rights to PVTGs. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because of the inaccurate description of the right to food under the NFSA.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Implementing Agency/Organization
1.  SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) :   National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA)
2.  ASMITA Project                             :   University Grants Commission (UGC) and Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS)
3.  National Medical Register (NMR) Portal      :   Ethics & Medical Registration Board (EMRB) of NMC
4.  Project NAMAN                               :   Indian Army
5.  #PlayTrue Campaign                         : World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The ASMITA project is indeed implemented by the UGC and BBS, focusing on multilingual study materials. The NMR portal is managed by the EMRB under the NMC. Project NAMAN, an Indian Army initiative, aims to support defense pensioners through CSCs.

Option (a) is incorrect because SPARSH is a pension system for defense pensioners, not related to NADA which deals with anti-doping. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct pairing of Project NAMAN with the Indian Army. Option (d) is incorrect because the #PlayTrue campaign is a WADA initiative, not related to any of the other initiatives listed.  The question tests factual recall of various government and organizational initiatives and their respective implementing bodies, demanding detailed knowledge of specific programs and their administrative structures.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                      Key Feature/Provision
1.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :   Established a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation.
2.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019     :   Mandates the creation of a National Medical Register (NMR).
3.  National Anti-Doping Act, 2022                  :   Established the South Asia Regional Anti-Doping Organization (SARADO).
4.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :  Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally.
5.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Provides Habitat Rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect the key features of the respective acts and regulations. The IHR, 2005, established a States Parties Committee. The NMC Act, 2019, mandates the NMR.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006, explicitly provides habitat rights to PVTGs.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly link features to the wrong acts/regulations.  The National Anti-Doping Act, 2022, does not establish SARADO; SARADO is a separate regional organization.  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is not related to international harmonization of anti-doping legislation; that is the purview of international conventions like the UNESCO Convention.  The question assesses understanding of specific legal frameworks related to public health, medical practice, and tribal rights.  It emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of the provisions and features of different laws.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                 Primary Objective/Focus
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Improve access to quality health facilities to ST households.
2.  Swadesh Darshan                              :   Promote tribal home stays to tap tourist potential.
3.  SARTHIE 1.0 Initiative                         :   Empower disadvantaged communities through legal support and awareness.
4.  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) NQAS Assessment :   Improve access to quality and affordable medical education.
5.  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) report :   Reduce gender inequalities in the agri-food sector.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a).  Swadesh Darshan indeed promotes tribal homestays. SARTHIE 1.0 focuses on legal aid and awareness for disadvantaged groups.  The GAIN report addresses gender inequalities in the agri-food sector.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. PM-JUGA's primary objective is broader socio-economic improvement of tribal communities, not solely focusing on health access for ST households (though it is a component). The Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) NQAS assessment aims to improve quality of healthcare facilities, not medical education.  The question tests the understanding of various government schemes and their specific goals, requiring nuanced knowledge of program objectives.  This differentiates between the primary and secondary goals of the programs, testing detailed comprehension.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agency                                   Key Function/Responsibility
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)                  :   Implements the National Anti-Doping Programme in India.
2.  National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA)              :   Coordinates anti-doping activities globally through ADAMS.
3.  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)                 :   Determines policies of the World Health Organization.
4.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)      :   Publishes the Global Gender Gap Report.
5.  World Economic Forum (WEF)                      :   Publishes the Gender Inequality Index (GII).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). NADA is responsible for India's anti-doping program, and UNDP publishes the GII.

The other options are incorrect because WHO doesn't implement India's anti-doping program (that's NADA); WADA, not WHO, coordinates global anti-doping via ADAMS; and WEF, not UNDP, publishes the Global Gender Gap Report.  This question tests knowledge of international and national organizations and their specific roles in health, sports, and gender equality, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of organizational mandates.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related organizations and their functions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                     State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                           :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                  :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                   :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                              :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                          :   Gujarat

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only Kamars (Chhattisgarh) and Maria Gond (Maharashtra) are correctly paired with their respective states.  The other pairings are incorrect. Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a tribal group primarily residing in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  Dongria Kondhs are indigenous to Odisha, not Gujarat. This question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their geographical distribution within India, a crucial aspect of understanding India's diverse population and socio-economic dynamics.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of various tribal groups and their locations, and to avoid simple guessing based on partial knowledge. The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately false pairings, highlighting the importance of precise geographical knowledge in this context.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to discern correct information from a set of seemingly plausible but incorrect options, assessing their analytical skills.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Ministry/Organization
1. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)               :   Ministry of Tourism
2. Swadesh Darshan                          :   Ministry of Rural Development
3. National Health Mission                   :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4. Skill India Mission                       :   Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
5. PM Jan Arogya Yojana                     :   Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only the National Health Mission (Ministry of Health and Family Welfare) and Skill India Mission (Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship) are accurately paired with their respective ministries.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) falls under the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Tourism. Swadesh Darshan is a central government scheme implemented by the Ministry of Tourism, not the Ministry of Rural Development. PM Jan Arogya Yojana is associated with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, not the Ministry of Finance.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and the ministries responsible for their implementation.  The incorrect options include plausible but incorrect ministry-scheme pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of government organizational structures and program implementation. The question assesses the candidate's ability to correctly associate government schemes with the responsible ministries, showcasing their knowledge of governance and administrative structures.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                           Key Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:  Defines 'habitat' as the area comprising customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups.
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871               :   Provided for the rehabilitation of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes.
3. Environment (Protection) Act, 1986    :   Aims to control and reduce air pollution by establishing pollution control boards at the central and state levels.
4. Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980       :   Establishes protected areas such as national parks and wildlife sanctuaries.
5. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :  Establishes an anti-doping helpline for athletes.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, indeed defines habitat as described. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, focuses on pollution control through designated boards. The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, establishes protected areas.  However, the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, is wrongly linked to rehabilitation; it was a discriminatory law. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, doesn't relate to anti-doping helplines. This question tests the knowledge of various Indian laws and regulations related to environment, forests, and tribal rights, assessing factual recall and understanding of legislative frameworks.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate’s ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate pairings based on their understanding of the legislation. The question further evaluates the candidate's analytical skills in identifying correctly matched pairs from a list of seemingly related but ultimately incorrect options.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                               Custodian Organization

2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                    :   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)     :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
4. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : World Food Programme (WFP)
5. National Health Accounts Estimates       :   National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). The Food Waste Index (FWI) is indeed overseen by the UNEP, and the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is published by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The National Health Accounts Estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS).  However, the Food Loss Index (FLI) is under the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), not UNEP. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is not solely under the World Food Programme (WFP); it involves multiple UN agencies.  This question tests the understanding of different reports and indices related to food security and nutrition, along with the organizations responsible for their publication and maintenance.  The incorrect options incorporate plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings, necessitating a detailed understanding of each report and its associated agency. This question assesses the candidate's ability to link specific reports with their correct custodian organizations, demonstrating their awareness of international organizations working in the field of food security and health.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Agreement/Convention         Key Focus

3. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005: Defines Pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capabilities.
4. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport: Aims to promote the prevention of and the fight against doping in sport.
5. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD): Focuses on the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  The Ramsar Convention, International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 (as amended), UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, and UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) are all correctly matched with their respective key focuses.  However, the Paris Agreement's primary focus is not solely on carbon credit trading; it's a broader framework for international climate action.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international agreements and conventions concerning environment, health, sports, and human rights. The inclusion of the Paris Agreement as a distractor, with a partially correct but incomplete description, demands a thorough understanding of the agreement’s multifaceted nature.  The question evaluates the candidate's analytical skills in differentiating between the accurate and inaccurate descriptions of international agreements, requiring precise knowledge of their key provisions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State

2. Bharias                                    :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                     :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                                 :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Kamars are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) found in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond are a PVTG residing in Maharashtra.  Option (a) is incorrect as the Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Option (c) is partially correct in including Kamars (Chhattisgarh), but incorrectly includes Bharias, who are from Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the mismatched pair of Paudi Bhuyans and Madhya Pradesh.  Understanding the geographical distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective policy implementation targeting their socio-economic development and preservation of their culture and heritage.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to analyze and evaluate the accuracy of information provided in paired statements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                 Key Feature
1. Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006            :   Defines habitat as area comprising customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups
2. 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme :   100% Central assistance in the form of funding (Grant-in-Aid and Creation of Capital Assets)
3.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006: Accords Habitat Rights after consultation with stakeholders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 explicitly defines "habitat" in relation to the customary areas of tribal groups within forests. The PVTG development scheme provides 100% central funding.  The FRA also mandates consultation with stakeholders before granting habitat rights.  This question assesses factual recall of key features of legislation and government schemes related to tribal welfare.  The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the legal framework and governmental initiatives aimed at protecting and empowering tribal communities. The option choices are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related concepts and legislation.


**3. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Number of PVTGs (as per a census)
1. Odisha                                    :   13
2. Chhattisgarh                              :   Highest among all states and UTs
3. Madhya Pradesh                            :   Part of the top 3 states with the highest PVTG population (along with Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Odisha houses 13 PVTGs, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 3 is also correct as Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra are among the top three states with the highest PVTG populations. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Odisha, not Chhattisgarh, has the highest number of PVTGs among all states and UTs.  This question tests knowledge about the distribution of PVTGs across different states and utilizes plausible distractors to increase difficulty.  The correct answer demonstrates understanding of the geographical concentration of PVTGs and their relative numbers in different states, a crucial aspect for effective policy formulation and implementation.



**4. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic/Fact                           Description
1. Origin                                      :   Communities notified as ‘born criminal’ during British rule
2. Current Status                             :   All nomadic tribes are DNTs
3. Supreme Court Ruling (Sukanya Santha vs. UoI) :   Upheld caste-based discrimination in prisons as constitutional

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. DNTs were indeed labelled as "born criminals" under the British Criminal Tribes Act of 1871.  Pair 2 is incorrect as not all nomadic tribes are DNTs; while all DNTs are nomadic or semi-nomadic. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Supreme Court in Sukanya Santha vs. UoI struck *down* caste-based discrimination in prisons, finding it unconstitutional.  This question tests knowledge of the historical context of DNTs and the legal battles fought for their rights. The inclusion of incorrect statements related to the current status and the Supreme Court ruling acts as a significant distractor, requiring careful evaluation and analysis of the provided information.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Nomadic Community Type                     Example
1. Hunter/trappers of birds and animals     :   Pardis
2. Pastoral communities                       :   Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups of peddlers             :   Banjaras

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Banjaras are an example of a peripatetic community known for their trading activities. Pair 1 is incorrect; Pardis are a pastoral community, not primarily hunters/trappers. Pair 2 is incorrect; Konda Reddis are primarily hunter-gatherers, not pastoralists.  The question tests knowledge of the different types of nomadic communities and their characteristics.  The incorrect pairings act as distractors, requiring the candidate to possess a detailed understanding of the subject matter to arrive at the correct answer.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to correctly categorize nomadic communities based on their primary livelihood strategies.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                       Key Feature/Objective

2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)      :  Primarily aims to fund research in humanities and social sciences.
3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)        :  Ranks educational institutions based on only research output.
4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment:  Exclusively assesses medical colleges.
5.  'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme:  Provides 50% central assistance to states.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **PM-JUGA:**  This scheme aims for comprehensive socio-economic development of tribal communities, encompassing social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods, not just healthcare.  It's a multi-faceted initiative.

2. **ANRF:** The ANRF's focus is broader than just humanities and social sciences. While these fields are included, the ANRF supports research across various priority areas, including EV mobility, advanced materials, solar cells, and health & medical technology, reflecting a commitment to STEM and technological advancement.

3. **NIRF:** The NIRF uses a multi-faceted approach to rank institutions. While research is a component, it also considers teaching, learning resources, graduation outcomes, outreach, and inclusivity, reflecting a holistic view of institutional quality.

4. **NQAS Assessment:** This assessment covers Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs), encompassing a wider scope than just medical colleges.  It's a part of a broader public health initiative.

5. **PVTG Scheme:** This scheme provides 100% central assistance, not 50%.  This underscores the central government's commitment to the development of these vulnerable groups.  The complete financial backing reflects the seriousness of addressing the challenges faced by PVTGs.



**2. With reference to the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                   PVTG Tribe

2.  Odisha                                 :  Bharias
3.  Chhattisgarh                           :  Maria Gond
4.  Maharashtra                            :  Kamars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

The provided pairings of states and PVTG tribes are all incorrect.  The correct associations are:

* **Odisha:** houses several PVTGs, including Paudi Bhuyans, Saora tribals, Juang, Chuktia Bhunjia, Hill Khadia, Dongria Kondhs, and Mankidia.
* **Madhya Pradesh:** includes the Bharias as a PVTG.
* **Chhattisgarh:** lists Kamars and Baigas as PVTGs.
* **Maharashtra:** includes the Maria Gond as a PVTG.

The question intentionally mixes up the states and tribes to test the candidate's precise knowledge of PVTG distribution across different states.  Each incorrect pairing serves as a strong distractor, highlighting the need for accurate factual recall.  The absence of any correctly matched pairs in the options underscores the difficulty of the question.




**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Organization/Source

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairings are incorrect.  Here's the correct attribution for each report:

1. **GHI 2024:**  This report is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WFP.  This highlights the involvement of NGOs in assessing global hunger levels.

2. **FWI Report 2024:** The Food Waste Index Report is published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme), not the FAO.  This underscores the multi-agency approach to addressing food waste.

3. **Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains:** This report is released by GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition), not the World Bank. This points to the role of specialized organizations in promoting nutrition-related investments.

4. **State of Food Security and Nutrition:** This report is published by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the World Health Organization (WHO), not Concern Worldwide.  This demonstrates the collaborative nature of global food security assessments.


The incorrect pairings in the question serve as effective distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge of the publishing organizations for each report.  The 'none' option being correct emphasizes the question's difficulty level.


**4. With reference to Global Rankings of Universities, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                        Institution/Organization
1.  QS World University Rankings 2025       :   Times Higher Education (THE)
2.  University Impact Rankings 2024           :   Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)
3.  World University Rankings 2025           :   National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

All the pairings in this question are incorrect.  The correct associations are:

1. **QS World University Rankings 2025:**  These rankings are released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), not Times Higher Education (THE).

2. **University Impact Rankings 2024:** These rankings are published by Times Higher Education (THE), not Quacquarelli Symonds (QS).

3. **World University Rankings 2025:**  These rankings are published by Times Higher Education (THE), not the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF).  The NIRF is a national ranking system for Indian institutions.

The question cleverly uses similar-sounding names of ranking organizations to create confusion.  The incorrect pairings effectively test the candidate's specific knowledge of the organizations behind each ranking system. The correct answer, (d) None, further emphasizes the difficulty of the question and the necessity for precise factual recall.


**1. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                          Specific Detail
1.  Definition of Pandemic Emergency              :   Includes communicable diseases exceeding national health system response capabilities
2.  Coordinating Financial Mechanism                :   Primarily benefits high-income countries
3.  States Parties Committee                         :   Focuses on improving global surveillance systems
4.  National IHR Authorities                       :   Aims to enhance international collaboration on disease outbreaks

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 77th World Health Assembly amended the IHR, 2005.  A key amendment redefined "pandemic emergency" to encompass communicable diseases with wide geographical spread or high risk thereof, exceeding national health systems' response capabilities. This directly addresses the limitations exposed during the COVID-19 pandemic.  The establishment of National IHR Authorities is crucial for better coordination within and between countries, improving preparedness and response.  Option (b) correctly identifies these two accurate pairings.

Option (c) is incorrect because while a States Parties Committee was established, its primary focus is on effective IHR implementation, not solely on improving global surveillance systems.  Other mechanisms are involved in surveillance. Option (d) is incorrect because the Coordinating Financial Mechanism aims to support *developing* countries, not high-income countries.  This is a critical aspect of global health equity. Option (a) is incomplete, omitting the accurate pairing related to National IHR Authorities.


**2. With reference to the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy Pillar                                      Specific Objective
1. Excellence on the Global Stage                 :   Focuses solely on grassroots sports development
2. Sports for Economic Development               :   Aims to integrate sports into the national curriculum
3. Sports for Social Development                   :   Prioritizes promotion of indigenous games
4. Sports – A People’s Movement                   :   Includes establishing a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024, released by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports,  has five pillars.  The "Sports for Social Development" pillar explicitly aims to promote indigenous games and enhance inclusivity through sports.  The "Sports – A People’s Movement" pillar seeks to engage communities and create a National Fitness Ranking & Indexing system, promoting fitness as a national goal. Options (3) and (4) correctly reflect these objectives.

Option (a) is incorrect because the "Excellence on the Global Stage" pillar encompasses a broader vision, including infrastructure development and talent identification, not solely grassroots development. Option (c) is partially correct regarding "Sports for Social Development" but incorrectly links "Sports for Economic Development" to curriculum integration; that is a goal of harmonizing with NEP, 2020, but not directly a pillar objective.  Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Finding                                             Specific Data
1. Global GHI Score                                  :   Indicates extremely high levels of hunger worldwide
2. India's GHI Rank                                   :   Improved significantly compared to 2023, indicating substantial progress
3. Percentage of India's population with undernourishment :   Significantly lower than the global average
4. Child wasting and stunting in India                 :   Remain high despite overall improvement in the GHI score


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, showed a global score of 18.3, indicating moderate hunger.  India's rank improved to 105th out of 127, a slight improvement, but still in the "serious" category.  Child wasting and stunting in India remain high, despite the improved rank, highlighting persistent nutritional challenges.  Pairs 2 and 4 accurately reflect these findings.

Option (a) is incorrect because the global GHI score reflects moderate, not extremely high, hunger levels. Option (b) is incorrect because the percentage of India's population with undernourishment is not significantly lower than the global average; it's a substantial number. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons mentioned above.


**4. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Aspect                                       Specific Detail
1. Report Theme                                      :   Focuses primarily on sustainable agricultural practices
2. New Definition of Financing for Food Security    :   Includes only public financial resources
3. Global Status of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)           :   Significant progress has been made towards achieving the goal
4. Number of Hungry People Globally in 2023       :   Less than 1 in 10 people


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 revealed that households globally wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022. All three pairs accurately reflect key findings from their respective reports. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Initiative                                   Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :   Providing free food grains to the poor
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana             :   Providing financial assistance for maternal health

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) aims to provide free food grains to a large number of poor households in India. The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance to pregnant women and new mothers for nutritional support and maternal healthcare. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to improve the nutritional status of children through supplementary nutrition programs in Anganwadi centers.  All three pairs accurately describe the objectives of the respective Indian initiatives. Therefore, option (d) is correct.

4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)            :   Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act, 2023, making pair 1 correct.  The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) system is designed to digitally store academic credits earned from various institutions, thus validating pair 4.  However, the other pairs are mismatched. PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) aims to pair universities with established institutions for mentorship, not to create world-class research centers; that's the goal of ANRF Centers of Excellence (ACE).  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas) focuses on solution-oriented research in priority areas, not mentorship. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairs that are factually inaccurate regarding the described initiatives and their key features.

4.  RPwD Act, 2016                            :   Mandates the government to formulate social security programs for PwDs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, making pair 1 incorrect regarding the chronology. The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) focuses on creating a barrier-free environment for persons with disabilities, making pair 3 correct.  The RPwD Act of 2016 mandates social security programs for PwDs, making pair 4 correct. The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, while it does address skill development, isn't solely focused on it.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly include pair 1, which contains an inaccurate chronological detail, and/or omit correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                  Funding Source/Key Goal

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA (also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, including infrastructure development, making pair 2 correct.  PM-JANMAN served as a model for PM-JUGA, validating pair 3.  DAPST grants are indeed allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, making pair 4 correct.  However, PM-JUGA's funding comes from existing DAPST grants, not primarily from private sources, making pair 1 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pair 1, which contains an inaccurate funding source, and/or omit correctly matched pairs.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                   Key Feature/Organization

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is indeed published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, making pair 1 correct.  The NIRF 2024 rankings integrated “Innovation” ranking, validating pair 2.  The World University Rankings 2025 uses 18 indicators for assessment, making pair 4 correct. However, the QS World University Rankings, 2025, is published by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), not Times Higher Education (THE), making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pair 3, which attributes the wrong publisher to the rankings, and/or omit correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Key Feature/Implementation Detail
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Focuses solely on the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
2.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) :   Funds allocated exclusively through the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.
3.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                         :   Provides pucca houses without considering water and electricity access.
4.  National Health Mission                             :   Does not include mobile medical units for immunization in remote areas.
5.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                           :   Exclusively focuses on higher education for Scheduled Tribes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **PM-JUGA:** This Abhiyan aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities broadly, not solely PVTGs. While PVTGs are a significant focus, the Abhiyan's scope is wider.

2. **DAPST:** While DAPST is a crucial funding source for PM-JUGA, it's not exclusively managed by the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Multiple line ministries are involved in its implementation.

3. **PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin):**  The scheme explicitly aims to provide pucca houses *with* access to tapped water and electricity supply, aligning with Jal Jeevan Mission and electricity provisions.

4. **National Health Mission:** The National Health Mission *does* utilize mobile medical units to enhance immunization coverage in areas lacking easy access to sub-centers, especially in remote and hilly regions.

5. **Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan:** This Abhiyan encompasses education at all levels, from primary to secondary and even vocational training, not limiting itself to only higher education for Scheduled Tribes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                     Mandate/Function
1.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)   :  Focuses exclusively on basic research in fundamental sciences.
2.  National Board of Accreditation (NBA)              : Primarily accredits higher education institutions.
3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)     :  Ranks only technical institutions.
4.  Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)                          :  Publishes only Indian university rankings.
5.  Times Higher Education (THE)                       :  Exclusively focuses on ranking institutions based on research output.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **ANRF:**  Its mandate extends beyond basic research to encompass fostering a culture of research and innovation across various fields, including applied research and technology development, aligned with national priorities.

2. **NBA:** While NBA is involved in accreditation, its scope includes diverse institutions and programs from diploma to postgraduate levels across various disciplines like engineering, management, and pharmacy, not just higher education.

3. **NIRF:**  NIRF's ranking system covers a wide range of educational institutions, encompassing universities, colleges, and other institutions across various disciplines, not just technical ones.

4. **QS:** QS World University Rankings have a global scope, covering institutions worldwide, not just those in India.

5. **THE:**  While research is a crucial parameter in THE rankings, they consider several other factors like teaching, learning environment, industry engagement, and international outlook, not solely relying on research output.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Provision/Focus
1.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :  Exclusively addresses the rights of nomadic tribes.
2.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :   Focuses only on physical disabilities.
3.  National Education Policy (NEP) 2020              :   Does not incorporate provisions for multiple exit options in undergraduate programs.
4.  Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024          :   Does not aim to integrate sports with education.
5.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Restricts the entry of foreign universities based solely on their global ranking.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The provided pairs misrepresent the key features of the acts and policies:

1. **FRA:** The FRA encompasses a broader range of forest-dwelling tribal communities, including both settled and nomadic groups, and addresses their forest rights, not exclusively nomadic tribes.

2. **UN-CRPD:**  The convention addresses the rights of persons with all types of disabilities – physical, mental, intellectual, and sensory impairments – promoting their full and equal participation in society.

3. **NEP 2020:** The NEP 2020 explicitly advocates for multiple exit options in undergraduate programs, allowing students to earn certifications, diplomas, or degrees based on their progress and needs.

4. **Draft NSP 2024:**  The draft policy explicitly aims to harmonize with NEP 2020, integrating sports with education to promote holistic development.

5. **UGC Regulations 2023:**  While global ranking is a significant criterion, the regulations also consider outstanding expertise in specific areas, allowing for a more nuanced selection process for foreign university campuses in India.  They don't solely rely on global ranking.

1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through infrastructure development.
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)      :  Established under the ANRF Act 2023, with a funding target of ₹50,000 crore for 2023-2028.
3.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education  : A formal mechanism to evaluate existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.
4.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                     :  Released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, it ranks countries based on hunger levels.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, a significant part of which involves developing social infrastructure. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act 2023 and has a stated funding goal of ₹50,000 crore for the period 2023-2028.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) accurately describes a formal system for evaluating prior learning from various sources. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was jointly released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe and does rank countries according to their hunger levels. Therefore, all four pairs demonstrate accurate pairings of schemes/initiatives with their key features or objectives.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to initiatives for persons with disabilities, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Provision
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Promotes full and equal enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.
2.  National Policy for PwDs 2006                 : Includes provisions for 5% reservation in Government and Government-aided higher educational institutions for PwDs.
3.  RPwD Act, 2016                               : Mandates the government to formulate programmes to safeguard the rights of PwDs for an adequate standard of living.
4.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) : Aims to make public spaces accessible to PwDs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) is a core international treaty focused on the full and equal enjoyment of rights by persons with disabilities. The National Policy for PwDs 2006 does include provisions for reservation in higher education for PwDs. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates the government's responsibility for ensuring an adequate standard of living for PwDs.  The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) is designed to improve accessibility for PwDs in public spaces.  Therefore, all the given pairs accurately reflect the key provisions of each act or policy.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

   Statement                                                Correct/Incorrect
1.  The GHI 2024 shows that hunger levels in 42 countries are at alarming levels.     :  Correct
2.  India's GHI score in 2024 improved compared to 2023.                         :  Correct
3.  The GHI 2024 highlights the link between gender inequality and hunger.          :  Correct
4.  The world's GHI score is considered to be in the "serious" category.              : Incorrect


Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The GHI 2024 report did indeed indicate alarming hunger levels in 42 countries, hindering the achievement of Zero Hunger by 2030.  India's ranking improved from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024, reflecting an improvement in its GHI score. The report also highlighted the strong correlation between gender inequality and hunger.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the world's GHI score is considered "moderate," not "serious."  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the false statement or exclude one or more true statements.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Programme                             Primary Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)           :  Providing nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers.
2.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0                     :  Improving nutrition levels in children through supplementary nutrition.
3.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)       :  Providing free food grains to the poor and vulnerable.
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013               :  Recognizing the right to food as a legal entitlement.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) primarily focuses on providing financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are initiatives aimed at improving the nutritional status of children, particularly those in the most vulnerable groups, through supplementary nutrition programs. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) provides free food grains to a large segment of the poor population. The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right, ensuring access to adequate food for a significant portion of the population.  All four schemes address different aspects of food security and nutrition in India.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following statements:**

    Statement                                                                 Correct/Incorrect
1.  PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader who resisted British rule. : Correct
2.  PM-JUGA's funding comes entirely from newly allocated central government funds.: Incorrect
3.  PM-JUGA aims to saturate critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities.: Correct
4.  PM-JUGA is a ten-year program.                                                  : Incorrect

Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule. The scheme also aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood for tribal communities. However, statement 2 is incorrect; PM-JUGA utilizes existing funds from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST). Statement 4 is also incorrect; PM-JUGA has a five-year tenure (2024-2029), not ten years.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include false statements or exclude true statements.


**1. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1.  PAIR                                        :   Established under the ANRF Act 2023
2.  MAHA                                        :   Focuses on EV mobility, Advanced Materials, and Solar Cells
3.  ACE                                         :   Seeks ₹50,000 crore funding for 2023-2028
4. ANRF                                        : Subsumed the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas) indeed focuses on research in areas like EV mobility, advanced materials, and solar cells, as stated in the provided text.  Furthermore, the ANRF (Anusandhan National Research Foundation) did subsume the erstwhile Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).

Pair 1 is incorrect. While ANRF was established under the ANRF Act 2023, PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) is an *initiative* under ANRF, not a defining feature of the Act itself. The Act establishes the foundation, while PAIR is a program launched *by* the foundation.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The ₹50,000 crore funding target is for the ANRF as a whole, not specifically for the ACE (ANRF Centre of Excellence) initiative. ACE is one of several programs funded under the overall ANRF budget.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Goal                                         Specific Intervention
1.  Goal 1 (Developing Enabling Infrastructure):  :   Skill India Mission
2.  Goal 2 (Promotion of Economic Empowerment): :   PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
3.  Goal 3 (Universalization of Access to Good Education): :   Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)
4.  Goal 4 (Healthy Lives and Dignified Ageing): :    Access to Ayushman Bharat Card

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a). Goal 1 of PM-JUGA focuses on developing enabling infrastructure, which includes providing access to Ayushman Bharat cards (as mentioned in the text).  Therefore, pair 4 is correctly matched.

Goal 2 aims at promoting economic empowerment, which is achieved through initiatives like Skill India Mission (providing skill development opportunities). Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Pairs 2 and 3 are incorrectly matched. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) falls under Goal 1 (infrastructure development), not Goal 2 (economic empowerment). Similarly, Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs) are part of Goal 2, not Goal 3 (education). Goal 3 focuses on improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) through initiatives like Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan, not TMMCs.


**3. With reference to the  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Finding                                    Specific Data Point
1.  Global GHI Score                          :   111th Rank for India
2.  India's GHI Score                           :   27.3
3.  India's Undernourishment Percentage     :    13.7%
4.  India's Child Wasting Percentage           :   35.5%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  The provided text states that India's GHI score is 27.3, 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment, and over 18.7% of children under five experience wasting.  While the exact percentage of child wasting mentioned in the text is >18.7%,  the options provided necessitate selecting the closest and most plausible figure available, making 35.5% a strong distractor. The 35.5% figure cited in the text actually pertains to stunting.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The text indicates India's rank improved to 105th in 2024 from 111th in 2023.  The question uses the previous year's rank as a distractor. Pair 4 is also incorrect because it uses the stunting percentage instead of wasting.


**4. Consider the following pairs related to the  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL):**

   Concept                                   Description
1.  RPL                                        :   A formal mechanism to evaluate existing skills gained through formal learning only.
2.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in Higher Education (2021-22)   :   23.7%
3.  Female GER in Higher Education (2021-22) :   28.5%
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)            :   A system for digitally storing academic credits earned informally.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  The description of RPL in the text accurately describes it as a formal mechanism used to evaluate a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.  Pair 3 correctly states the female GER in higher education in 2021-22 was 28.5%. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is indeed a digital system for storing academic credits.

Pair 1 is incorrect because RPL evaluates skills from all sources of learning, not just formal. Pair 2 is incorrect; 23.7% was the GER in 2014-15, not 2021-22.  The question uses a previous year's data as a distractor.


**5. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                 Specific Detail
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency           :   Focuses on communicable diseases with wide geographical spread.
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism:   Primarily benefits developed countries.
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities       :   Aims to improve coordination among countries.
4.  Successor to International Sanitary Regulations (1951)   :   World Health Organization (WHO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). The amendment defining pandemic emergencies correctly focuses on communicable diseases with wide geographical spread or a high risk thereof exceeding national health system response capabilities. The creation of National IHR Authorities is explicitly aimed at improving coordination among countries.

Pair 2 is incorrect.  The purpose of the coordinating financial mechanism is to aid *developing* countries, not developed ones. Pair 4 is incorrect because the IHR, not the WHO, is the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951). The WHO is the organization *behind* the IHR.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Custodian Agency
1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                       :   World Food Programme
2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                      :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)       :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
4. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index (FWI) is indeed tracked by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), as stated in the provided text.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), a key fact also mentioned.  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment initiative is clearly linked to the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India. However, the Food Loss Index (FLI) is mistakenly paired with the World Food Programme (WFP). While both WFP and FAO are involved in food security initiatives, the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) is the custodian agency for the FLI, not the WFP. This detail, while not explicitly stated in every source, is a commonly known fact in the context of SDG indicators.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pair involving the FLI.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Primary Goal
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) :   Support nascent-stage university research through mentorship from established institutions
2. MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas)     :   Fund research in areas such as EV mobility and solar cells
3. ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)               :    Establish world-class research centers in underdeveloped regions of India
4. Spot Food License Initiative                      :    Facilitate instant issuance of food licenses via an IT platform


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PAIR's goal is accurately described as pairing universities for mentorship, and MAHA's focus on priority research areas like EV mobility and solar cells is also correct. The Spot Food License initiative aims to simplify licensing through a digital platform, as stated. However, the description of ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) is inaccurate. While ACE aims to establish world-class research centers, the text does not specify a focus on underdeveloped regions.  The provided text focuses on the overall goal of establishing these centers with substantial funding, not their geographical location. Therefore, option (c) is incorrect because of the inaccurate description for ACE. Options (a) and (d) are incomplete.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                        Key Focus/Theme
1. Food Waste Index Report 2024                :   Global and national food waste generation at retail and consumer levels
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3. The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains     :   Gender impact and nutrition investments in the agri-food sector
4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)        :    Analysis of global food production and distribution networks


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 accurately focuses on food waste at retail and consumer levels. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 correctly emphasizes financing for food security and nutrition.  The GAIN report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," accurately highlights gender impact and nutrition investments in the agri-food sector. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), however, focuses on the root causes of food crises and humanitarian responses, not on global food production and distribution networks as suggested in option 4. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the GRFC's focus.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                          Top Ranked Indian Institution (2024/2025)
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025            :   Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)
2. University Impact Rankings 2024              :   Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
3. NIRF (National Institutional Ranking Framework) 2024:   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
4. Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings 2025 :   Indian Institute of Technology Madras


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

IIT Bombay is correctly identified as the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is correctly identified as the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024.  However, the other two pairs are incorrect.  The text states that IIT Madras topped the overall category in NIRF 2024, not IISc Bangalore. Similarly, IISc Bangalore was the top-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings, but within a broader rank range (251-300), not necessarily the overall top. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include these mismatched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Provision/Feature
1.  ANRF Act 2023                               :   Subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Allows top 500 global universities to establish campuses in India
3.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :   Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF Act 2023 correctly subsumed SERB. The UGC regulations of 2023 accurately allow the establishment of campuses by top-ranked foreign universities. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, correctly provides habitat rights to PVTGs. However, the NFSA, 2013, recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right.  This distinction is crucial. Fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution and are justiciable (can be enforced through courts), while statutory rights are created by legislation. Although the NFSA aims to ensure food security, it does not elevate the right to food to the status of a fundamental right. Therefore, options (c) and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the NFSA provision. Option (a) is incomplete.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :   Successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951)
2. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :   Provides for termination of pregnancies by Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs)
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :   Enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution
4. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment in line with the Vishaka Judgment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 is indeed the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, establishing a legally binding framework for international public health emergencies. The MTP Act of 1971 legally allows for the termination of pregnancies under specific conditions, carried out by registered medical practitioners. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, was enacted using the powers granted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, which allows for special provisions for women and children. Finally, the POSH Act of 2013 aligns its definition of sexual harassment with the landmark Vishaka judgment, setting a legal precedent for addressing workplace sexual harassment.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                       Implementing Body/Organization
1. National Health Accounts Estimates                :   National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
2.  National Policy for PwDs, 2006                 :   Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment
3. Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (2015)          :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
4.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) (2015) :   Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate pairings of acts/policies with their respective implementing bodies. The National Health Accounts Estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS). The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, which is responsible for the welfare of persons with disabilities.  The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme is implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The Accessible India Campaign is a flagship initiative of the Department of Empowerment of Persons with Disabilities.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, encompassing all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. With reference to legal frameworks concerning vulnerable groups, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Primary Focus/Concern
1.  Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006         :   Prevention of child marriages and providing relief to victims
2.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 : Care and protection of children at risk of marriage
3.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :  Prohibition of child labor in all occupations and hazardous work for adolescents
4.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 :  Provides reservation in education and government jobs for PwDs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects the primary focus of the respective legislation. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, explicitly aims to prohibit child marriages and provide relief to victims. The Juvenile Justice Act of 2015 focuses on the care and protection of children, including those at risk of child marriage. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, prohibits child labor, especially hazardous work for adolescents.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, provides for the inclusion of PwDs, including reservations in education and employment.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit at least one accurately matched pair.


**4. With reference to the World Health Organization (WHO) and its activities, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Initiative                                  Function/Description
1. World Health Assembly (WHA)                     :   Decision-making body of the WHO
2. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :   Legally binding framework for handling cross-border health emergencies
3.  National IHR Authorities (post-amendment)       :   Improved coordination among countries for IHR implementation
4.  Coordinating Financial Mechanism (post-IHR amendment) : Addresses the needs of developing countries in health emergencies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The World Health Assembly (WHA) serves as the decision-making body of the WHO. The International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, as amended, provide a legally binding framework for countries to manage public health events that could cross borders.  The creation of National IHR Authorities improves coordination and response at a national level.  The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism directly addresses the financial needs of developing countries during health crises. Therefore, all three pairs accurately reflect the functions and descriptions of the entities and initiatives within the context of the WHO. Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not reflect the accurate pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Body                                 Related Act/Legislation
1.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC)              :   Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013
2.  Juvenile Justice Board (JJB)                   :   Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015
3.  Medical Board (as per MTP Amendment Act, 2021) :   Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971
4.  States Parties Committee (post-IHR amendment) : International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately link the committee or body with the relevant legislation.  The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is established under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013 to handle complaints of sexual harassment.  The Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) is the key body within the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Medical Boards, as established under the amended Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 2021, are crucial for assessing cases requiring abortion beyond 24 weeks.  Finally, the States Parties Committee is a new body created as part of the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct pairing.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005           Feature
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency                     :   Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism   :   Defining pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread exceeding national health system response capacity
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities              :   Successor of the International Sanitary Regulations (1951)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only.  The amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 did indeed establish a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of developing countries, particularly in responding to pandemics. This was a crucial addition to the IHR framework, acknowledging the significant financial burden placed on nations, especially those with less robust healthcare systems, during public health emergencies.  Option 1 is incorrect because defining a pandemic emergency and establishing a States Parties Committee are distinct amendments. While both relate to improving pandemic preparedness and response, they are not directly linked in a paired manner.  Option 3 incorrectly pairs the creation of National IHR Authorities with the IHR's origins. The creation of national authorities is a modern addition to enhance coordination, while the IHR's origins are in the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951.  Option (d) is incorrect as at least one pair is correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the IHR amendments. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as linking the definition of pandemic emergency with the committee or the national authorities with the historical context, makes this a challenging question, suitable for a UPSC-level examination.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                    Characteristic
1.  World Health Assembly (WHA)                :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Decision-making body of the World Health Organisation
3.  Primary Medical Board (PMB)                :   Comprises at least 3 members for evaluating withdrawal of life support

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 3 only. The World Health Assembly (WHA) is indeed the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), responsible for setting policies, appointing the Director-General, and overseeing financial matters.  The Primary Medical Board (PMB), as described in the context of euthanasia guidelines, comprises at least three members to assess requests for withdrawal of life support.  Option 1 is incorrect because the WHA is not established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993; that Act establishes the NHRC. The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional one, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  The question tests knowledge about different organizations and their functions. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but incorrect, making the question challenging and appropriate for a competitive examination.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Function
1.  National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) :   Reviews Constitutional and Legal safeguards for women
2.  National Commission for Women (NCW)          :   Prepares National Health Accounts Estimates
3.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty     :   Supports efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 2 and 3 only. The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) prepares the National Health Accounts estimates, providing a detailed financial overview of India's health system. The National Commission for Women (NCW) reviews constitutional and legal safeguards for women and advises the government on policy matters affecting women.  The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to support and accelerate efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty, aligning with Sustainable Development Goals 1 and 2.  Option 1 is incorrect as NHATS' function is preparing the National Health Accounts, not reviewing women's safeguards. This question tests the understanding of different organizations' roles in different sectors. Distractors are carefully placed to test accurate recall and understanding of the organizations' functions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                         Key Feature
1.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024:   Tracks global food waste generation at retail and consumer levels
2.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                      :   Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
3.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)                :   Produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  Option 1 is incorrect; the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition, not food waste tracking. The Food Waste Index Report 2024, as its name suggests, tracks global and national food waste generation at the retail and consumer levels. The question tests knowledge on various reports related to food security and nutrition.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, making it a challenging question for candidates.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding reports.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Provision
1.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013       :   Recognizes the right to food as a constitutional right
2.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :   Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3.  Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016           :   Mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 3 only.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, does provide habitat rights to PVTGs.  The Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016, mandates 5% reservation in government jobs for persons with disabilities.  Option 1 is incorrect because the NFSA recognizes the right to food as a statutory right, not a constitutional right. The question tests the knowledge of different Acts and their provisions related to social welfare and tribal rights. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible yet incorrect, making the question challenging and testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                       Key Feature
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :   Established by the World Health Organization (WHO)
2. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment based on the Vishaka Judgment
3. Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005 :  Enacted under Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution
4. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 :  Allows termination of pregnancies by Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The IHR (2005) is a WHO framework defining countries' responsibilities in handling cross-border health emergencies. The POSH Act (2013) incorporates the Supreme Court's Vishaka guidelines on sexual harassment. The PWDVA (2005) leverages Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution, which allows for special provisions for women and children. Finally, the MTP Act (1971) legally permits termination of pregnancies under specified conditions by registered medical practitioners.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  The options provided offer a progression of increasing correctness, testing the candidate's thorough understanding of each act/legislation and its defining characteristics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                      Salient Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Named after Birsa Munda
2. Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality  :   Launched in Davos 2024
3. National Health Accounts Estimates                    :   Released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)
4.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) :   Launched in 2015


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the salient features of the schemes and initiatives mentioned. PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader. The Alliance for Global Good was launched at the Davos 2024 summit.  The National Health Accounts Estimates are published by the MoHFW.  Finally, the Accessible India Campaign did launch in 2015.  The question effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and international initiatives related to social welfare, health, and gender equality.  Each pairing is distinct and avoids any overlap, forcing the candidate to accurately recall specific details.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                      Governing Body/Authority
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   University Grants Commission (UGC)
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     :   World Health Organization (WHO)
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) :   Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) and Local Complaints Committee (LCC)
4.  Mental Healthcare Act, 2017                      :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The question tests the understanding of the regulatory frameworks and their associated governing bodies. The UGC is responsible for the 2023 regulations on foreign university campuses in India. The WHO governs the IHR (2005).  The POSH Act (2013) establishes the ICC and LCC for handling complaints.  The Mental Healthcare Act (2017) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  All pairings are accurate; there's no ambiguity or potential for confusion.  The options are designed to challenge the candidate's recall of specific details and their ability to connect legislation with the appropriate governing authority.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Survey                                    Key Finding/Feature
1. National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) Report :  Provides data on health indicators across India
2. Justice Hema Committee report                   :   Highlighted sexual harassment in the Malayalam film industry
3.  QS World University Rankings, 2025           :   Ranks universities globally based on performance indicators
4. University Impact Rankings 2024                :   Identifies universities excelling in UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key characteristic of the respective report or survey. NFHS-5 indeed provides comprehensive health data for India. The Justice Hema Committee report focused on sexual harassment within the Malayalam film industry.  QS World University Rankings are known for their global university rankings based on various performance indicators.  Finally, the University Impact Rankings assess universities' performance against UN SDGs.  The question tests the candidate's familiarity with different types of reports and their key findings. The options are structured to assess the candidate's comprehensive understanding of each report's scope and focus.  There are no misleading or incorrect pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Medical Act/Amendment                                      Specific Provision
1.  MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021                            :   Increased the time limit for abortion
2.  Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023                           :  Defines cruelty towards married women
3.  Supreme Court directives on Euthanasia                 :   Recognized the right to die with dignity
4.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Promotes full and equal enjoyment of human rights for PwDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

This question evaluates the candidate's understanding of various legal frameworks and their specific provisions. The MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, notably extended the permissible gestational period for abortion.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, includes provisions addressing cruelty against married women.  Supreme Court pronouncements on euthanasia have established the right to die with dignity.  Lastly, the UN-CRPD is dedicated to promoting the rights of persons with disabilities. All four pairs are accurately matched, demanding precise knowledge of legal provisions from different sources.  The options are designed to test the candidate's ability to connect specific legal acts with their key features.  No distractors are present; the correct answer encompasses all pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                  Associated Goal/Initiative
1. World Health Organization (WHO)           :   Halving per-capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels
2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)   :   Reducing food losses along production and supply chains
3. United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):  Establishing a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 2 accurately reflects the association between the organization and its initiative. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is indeed the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which directly addresses the reduction of food losses along production and supply chains, aligning with SDG 12.3.1 (a).

Option 1 is incorrect as the World Health Organization (WHO) is not primarily involved in halving per-capita global food waste. While food waste has public health implications, it's not a central focus of the WHO's mandate.  The Food Waste Index (FWI), aimed at reducing food waste at retail and consumer levels, falls under the purview of UNEP, not WHO.

Option 3 is incorrect.  The establishment of a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation is a key amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, overseen by the WHO, not UNEP. UNEP's focus is primarily environmental, while the IHR deals with global health security.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                            Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Provision of Supplementary Nutrition to bridge the gap between Recommended Dietary Allowance and Average Daily Intake
2. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)     :   Improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0              :    Providing food grains free of cost to 80 crore poor
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 2 and 3 correctly link schemes with their core objectives.  The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) is explicitly designed to provide free food grains to a large segment of the poor population, as stated.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on improving nutrition levels among vulnerable populations by bridging the nutritional gap through supplementary food provisions.


Pair 1 is incorrect.  PM-JUGA's primary objective is the comprehensive socio-economic development of tribal communities, encompassing improvements in infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.  Supplementary nutrition programs are a part of other schemes, not PM-JUGA's central focus.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Organization/Agency
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024               :    United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024              :   World Economic Forum (WEF)
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 2 correctly identifies the organization responsible for publishing the report. The World Economic Forum (WEF) is indeed the publisher of the Global Gender Gap Report.


Pair 1 is incorrect. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the UNDP.  While UNDP works on related development goals, they are not the publishers of the GHI.

Pair 3 is also incorrect. The "State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report" is produced by several UN agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the World Food Programme (WFP), not Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe publish the Global Hunger Index (GHI).


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                     Key Provision/Objective
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) : Defining "habitats" for primitive tribal groups and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                          :  Granting habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
3. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005     : Establishing a coordinating financial mechanism to address the needs of developing countries
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the key provisions of the respective acts and regulations.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) specifically defines "habitat" within its framework for certain tribal groups, as stated. The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, indeed include the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism to assist developing nations in responding to public health emergencies.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was a discriminatory law that wrongly labelled certain communities as "criminal tribes." It did not grant any rights, especially not habitat rights to PVTGs.  The FRA, not the Criminal Tribes Act, addresses habitat rights.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Report                                      Key Finding/Indicator
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                   : India ranked 108th out of 193 countries
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022                : 68.5% of the global gender gap has been closed
3. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                  : India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). Only pair 3 accurately reflects a key finding from the specified report. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 indeed reported India's ranking as 105th out of 127 countries.


Pair 1 is incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report does not provide a ranking of 108th for India out of 193 countries.  This ranking actually belongs to the Gender Inequality Index (GII).

Pair 2 is also incorrect. The finding that 68.5% of the global gender gap has been closed is associated with the Global Gender Gap Report, not the Gender Inequality Index (GII).  The GII uses a different methodology and scoring system.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Headquarters Location
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)          :    Geneva, Switzerland
2.  Concern Worldwide                        :    Dublin, Ireland
3.  Welthungerhilfe                          :    Bonn, Germany
4.  GAIN                                      :    Geneva, Switzerland


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  This is a widely known fact. Concern Worldwide is an Irish-based NGO, with its headquarters in Dublin, Ireland, not Geneva as stated in option (d). Welthungerhilfe, a German based NGO, has its headquarters in Bonn, Germany.  GAIN, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, is indeed headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the WHO, omitting correctly matched pairs. Option (b) is partially correct, but omits the correct pairing of Welthungerhilfe. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Concern Worldwide's headquarters.  Therefore, only options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                    Prominent Feature
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :   Successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1965)
2.  ANRF Act 2023                               :   Subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB)
3. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Requires Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked in the global top 200
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The IHR (2005) is indeed the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations, though the year is not 1965 but 1951.  The ANRF Act 2023 did subsume the SERB. The NFSA 2013 does recognize the right to food as a statutory right, not a fundamental right.  The UGC regulation for foreign university campuses requires FHEIs to be ranked in the global top 500, not top 200 as stated. Option (a) is incomplete because it misses the correct pairing of the NFSA. Option (b) is incorrect as it incorrectly pairs the UGC regulation and includes a false statement. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the UGC regulation and includes a false statement. Only options 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the prominent features of the given acts and regulations.  The minor inaccuracy in the year of the International Sanitary Regulations does not invalidate the core connection.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                            Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :   Provision of supplementary nutrition to bridge the gap between RDA and ADI
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana      :   Wage support and nutritious food for registered women upon the birth of their first child
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0        :   Providing free food grains to 80 crore poor people
4. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana accurately focuses on providing wage support and nutritious food to registered women upon the birth of their first child. The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) correctly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  However, the other options incorrectly link schemes with their focus areas. PMGKAY provides free food grains, not supplementary nutrition. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on supplementary nutrition, not free food grains.  Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly assign focus areas to the schemes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                 Key Feature/Publisher
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024              :   Published by the United Nations
2. NIRF 2024                                    :   Includes ranking for Open Universities
3. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 :  Uses 18 indicators to assess institutions
4. QS World University Rankings, 2025         :   Top-ranked Indian Institution is IIT Delhi


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The NIRF 2024 rankings did indeed include a ranking for Open Universities. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 utilizes 18 indicators to assess institutions across five key areas. The GHI 2024 is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the United Nations.  The top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025 is IIT Bombay, not IIT Delhi. Option (a) is partially correct but contains an incorrect statement about the GHI publisher. Option (c) is incomplete as it misses a correct pairing. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes a false statement about the GHI publisher. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                   Focus Area
1. UNICEF                                     :   Population and Development
2. UNFPA                                     :   Children's rights and welfare
3. FAO                                        :   Food security and agriculture
4. WFP                                        :   Human rights


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) correctly focuses on food security and agriculture.  The other organizations have different primary mandates. UNICEF's primary focus is on children's rights and welfare, not population and development. UNFPA's main focus is on population and development, not children's rights. The World Food Programme (WFP) focuses on food assistance, not human rights.  Option (a) is incorrect because UNICEF's focus is misrepresented. Option (c) is partially correct but incorrectly attributes a focus area to UNFPA. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes a focus area to WFP. Therefore, only option 3 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State/UT
1. Paudi Bhuyans                           :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                  :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                   :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                              :   Maharashtra
5. Juang                                    :   Mizoram

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) residing in Chhattisgarh, and Maria Gond is a PVTG found in Maharashtra.  The other pairings are incorrect. Paudi Bhuyans are a PVTG of Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a PVTG of Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Finally, the Juang tribe is found in Odisha, not Mizoram.  This question tests factual recall of PVTG distribution across Indian states.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, as they involve other PVTGs and states mentioned in the text, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the specific tribe-state pairings.  Incorrect options strategically include combinations of correct and incorrect pairings, making simple elimination strategies less effective.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                   Key Feature
1. PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan       :   Focuses on 22 lakh FRA patta holders
2. 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme :   100% Central assistance
3. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna     :   Rs 5000/- on birth of first child for wage support
4. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0     :   Bridges the gap between RDA and ADI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The PM Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan has a special focus on supporting the 22 lakh FRA patta holders. The 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme is indeed a Centrally Sponsored Scheme with 100% Central assistance. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides registered women with Rs 5000/- upon the birth of their first child.  Finally, Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to bridge the nutritional gap between the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Average Daily Intake (ADI).  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes and their key objectives, requiring both factual recall and understanding of the scheme's implementation. The inclusion of all correct pairs as options increases the difficulty by requiring the candidate to possess complete knowledge of all the schemes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Global Report                                 Key Organization/Initiative
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024            :   Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024  :   Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024              :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was indeed launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and WRAP.  The other pairings are incorrect. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, was not associated with Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, although they may be involved in related work. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various global reports related to food security and nutrition and the organizations behind their publication.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates who might have some familiarity with the reports but lack precise knowledge of the publishing organizations.  The question demands high accuracy in recalling organizational details.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                     Key Feature
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025        :   Based on 9 Performance indicators
2. University Impact Rankings 2024           :   Identifies universities excelling across UN SDGs
3. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 :   Includes "Innovation" ranking

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The QS World University Rankings 2025 are indeed based on nine performance indicators. The University Impact Rankings 2024 identify universities excelling across multiple United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 includes an "Innovation" ranking. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of different university ranking frameworks and their methodologies.  The inclusion of all correct pairs in the options ensures that the candidate needs to have a thorough understanding of each ranking system to answer correctly, making it a difficult question.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                   Key Provision
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :   Accords Habitat Rights after stakeholder consultation
2. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023  :   Requires foreign universities to be ranked in global top 500
3. National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016 :   Uses System of Health Accounts, 2011


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006 does accord habitat rights after a sequence of consultations with stakeholders.  The UGC regulations of 2023 for foreign university campuses in India do indeed require these universities to be ranked within the global top 500.  Finally, the National Health Accounts Guidelines for India, 2016, utilize the System of Health Accounts, 2011, as a framework.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific acts, regulations, and guidelines and their key provisions. The inclusion of all correct pairs as options increases the difficulty level by demanding comprehensive knowledge of the subjects.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the specific provisions of each act or regulation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Ministry of Rural Development
2. Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
3.  National Health Mission                    : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                 : Ministry of Panchayati Raj

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a comprehensive government initiative designed to bring development to tribal-majority villages in India.  It aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood development. While various ministries collaborate, its primary implementation and oversight are under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is indeed under the Union Ministry of Rural Development. This focuses on empowering women through self-help groups (SHGs) and poverty alleviation. Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The National Health Mission (NHM) is correctly paired with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  The NHM is a flagship program focused on improving health outcomes across the nation. Pair 3 is correctly matched.

The PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), focusing on rural housing, falls under the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Pair 4 is incorrectly matched.

2.  National Policy for PwDs 2006            :  Focuses solely on employment opportunities for PwDs
3.  Scheme for Implementing of Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 (SIPDA) :  Provides financial assistance for assistive devices
4.  National Action Plan for Skill Training of PwDs :  Exclusively targets university education for PwDs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) aims to make public spaces and services accessible to people with disabilities. Pair 1 is correctly matched.

The National Policy for PwDs 2006 is a broader policy encompassing various aspects of disability welfare, not limited to employment alone. Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The Scheme for Implementing of Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 (SIPDA) indeed provides financial assistance for assistive devices and other support for PwDs.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.

The National Action Plan for Skill Training of PwDs focuses on skill development opportunities for PwDs, but it's not limited to university education.  Pair 4 is incorrectly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Primary Goal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) provides financial assistance and nutritional support to pregnant women and lactating mothers. Pair 1 is correctly matched.

Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on improving nutrition and healthcare for children and pregnant women, not sanitation. Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, aims to provide subsidized food grains to a significant portion of the population. Pair 3 is correctly matched.

PMGKAY (Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana) provides free food grains to vulnerable populations, not promoting sustainable agriculture. Pair 4 is incorrectly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                 Provision
1.  ANRF Act 2023                           :  Established the National Research Foundation

4.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Focuses solely on skill development for tribal communities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF Act 2023 established the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), which aims to foster research and innovation. Pair 1 is correctly matched.

The National Education Policy (NEP) is a broad framework for education reform; it doesn't mandate a specific scheme like PM-JUGA.  Pair 2 is incorrectly matched.

The Forest Rights Act (FRA) does indeed grant habitat rights to PVTGs.  Pair 3 is correctly matched.

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, is a broader act concerning forest rights, not solely focused on skill development.  Pair 4 is incorrectly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                               Custodian Organization

2. Food Waste Index Report 2024            :  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
3.  System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011   :  World Bank
4. National Health Accounts Estimates for India :  Ministry of Health and Family Welfare

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Food Programme (WFP). Pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed published by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). Pair 2 is correctly matched.

The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 is a global standard framework, a result of joint cooperation among OECD, WHO, and Eurostat; not solely the World Bank. Pair 3 is incorrectly matched.

The National Health Accounts Estimates for India are derived and prepared using the SHA framework, but the custodian is the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Pair 4 is correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   **Convention Feature**                                    **Detail**
1. Adoption Year of UN-CRPD                               : 2008

3. Year UN-CRPD entered into force                         : 2006
4. Theme of the 17th session of the Conference of State Parties : “Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future”

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008.  Therefore, pair 1 and 3 are incorrect.  The convention currently has 164 signatories, including India, making pair 2 correct. The theme of the 17th session of the Conference of State Parties was indeed “Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future,” making pair 4 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (d) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding international conventions on disability rights and their key features is crucial for the UPSC exam, highlighting the importance of knowing the details like the number of signatories and the specific themes of important conferences.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   **Scheme Feature**                                      **Detail**
1.  Scheme's namesake                                     :  Birsa Munda
2.  Primary Funding Source                               :  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
3.  Duration of the Scheme                              : 10 Years
4.  Number of villages covered                             : 63,000


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA scheme is named after Birsa Munda, correctly matching pair 1.  The scheme aims to cover approximately 63,000 villages, making pair 4 correct. However, the primary funding source for PM-JUGA is the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), making pair 2 incorrect. The scheme's duration is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10 years, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes targeting tribal welfare and their implementation details, a common theme in the UPSC exam.


**3. With reference to the Lakhpati Didi Initiative, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative Feature**                                   **Detail**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis, making pair 1 correct.  The annual household income threshold is indeed Rs. 1 Lakh, correctly matching pair 2. The minimum average monthly income threshold is Rs. 10,000, not Rs. 5,000, making pair 3 incorrect. The initiative is implemented under the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) under the Union Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of women-led development initiatives and their key features, a relevant area for the UPSC exam.


**4. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Health Indicator**                                      **Trend in 2021-22 (since 2017-18)**
1.  Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a % of GDP          : Decreased
2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a % of THE    : Increased
3.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a % of THE : Increased
4. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a % of THE : Increased


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18, making pair 1 incorrect.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE did increase, making pair 2 correct. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased, making pair 3 incorrect. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE increased, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of health economics indicators and trends in India, a relevant area for the UPSC exam, requiring an analytical understanding of healthcare financing data.



**5. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education, consider the following pairs:**

   **RPL Feature**                                          **Detail**
1.  Mechanism for evaluating existing knowledge            : Formal assessment
2.  Purpose                                                : To integrate informal learning into formal education
3.  Year Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education reached 28.4%  : 2014-15
4.  Method of credit storage                               : Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

RPL is indeed a formal mechanism used to evaluate a person's existing knowledge, skills, and experience, making pair 1 correct.  Its purpose is to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal education system, making pair 2 correct. The Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in higher education reached 28.4% in 2021-22, not 2014-15, making pair 3 incorrect. The Academic Bank of Credit (ABC) is used to digitally store academic credits, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of higher education reforms in India, specifically the concept of RPL and its integration with the National Education Policy (NEP), a recurring theme in the UPSC examination.  The ability to differentiate between related but distinct facts is vital here.


**1. With reference to anti-doping measures in sports, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative/Act**                                    **Key Feature/Characteristic**
1.  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport    :   Adopted in 2005, aims to harmonize anti-doping legislation globally.
2.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985      :   Addresses doping through banned substances in India.
3.  #PlayTrue Campaign                                      :   Conducted by NADA to commemorate WADA’s Play True Day.
4.  Anti-Doping helpline number                             :   Provides information on anti-doping rules and guidelines for athletes.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport is a significant international treaty aimed at creating a standardized approach to anti-doping rules and regulations worldwide.  It was indeed adopted in 2005 in Paris. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, while broader in scope, directly impacts doping in sports by criminalizing the use and distribution of substances frequently used for performance enhancement.  The #PlayTrue campaign is a well-known initiative by the National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA) of India, directly linked to WADA's Play True Day, focusing on awareness and education.  Finally, the existence of a dedicated anti-doping helpline is a common feature in many national and international anti-doping programs, providing a crucial resource for athletes and support personnel seeking clarification on rules and guidelines.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to initiatives promoting multilingualism in education, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative**                                          **Implementing Agency/Key Feature**
1.  Asmita Project                                         :   Aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages in 5 years.
2.  Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                                  :   A multilingual dictionary repository developed by the Ministry of Education.
3.  Real-time Translation Architecture                      :   Enhances translation using cutting-edge technology, implemented by UGC.
4.  New Education Policy 2020                              :   Promotes multilingualism in education as a core principle.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Asmita Project's core aim is the production of study materials in various scheduled languages,  as stated. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is indeed a multilingual dictionary initiative under the Ministry of Education.  The Real-time Translation Architecture uses technology to improve translation capabilities, but the implementing agency is not solely the UGC; multiple agencies could be involved. The New Education Policy 2020 is the overarching policy framework that promotes multilingualism, but it is not an initiative in itself, rather a policy that guides initiatives like Asmita.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively and completely correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs or include the NEP 2020, which is not a specific project or initiative.


**3. With reference to  Indian Higher Education Rankings, consider the following pairs:**

   **Ranking System**                                  **Top-Ranked Indian Institution (as of the given period)**
1.  NIRF 2024 (Overall Category)                         :   IIT Madras
2.  NIRF 2024 (Universities Category)                     :   IISC Bangalore
3.  QS World University Rankings 2025                    :   IIT Bombay
4.  Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 :   IISc Bangalore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly reflect the top-ranked Indian institutions according to the specified ranking systems and years. IIT Madras consistently topped the overall category in NIRF rankings, IISc Bangalore dominated the universities category, IIT Bombay led among Indian institutions in QS rankings, and IISc Bangalore was the highest-ranked Indian university in the Times Higher Education rankings in the given period. Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of recent higher education rankings data.


**4. With reference to  Projects and Schemes for Tribal Welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   **Scheme/Project**                                  **Key Objective/Feature**
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Focuses on improving socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
2.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan            :   Named after Birsa Munda, aims for saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure.
3.  PM-JANMAN                                            :   Provided learnings and success for PM-JUGA implementation.
4.  Tribal Home Stay                                      :   Promotes 1000 homestays under Swadesh Darshan to tap tourist potential.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. PM-JUGA (also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) explicitly aims to uplift tribal communities socio-economically.  The scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda and strives to fill critical gaps in infrastructure. PM-JANMAN served as a model for PM-JUGA's implementation. The Tribal Home Stay initiative is part of PM-JUGA, aiming to boost tourism and provide economic opportunities. Thus, option (d) is correct, indicating that all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs. This question tests the knowledge of government schemes and their features related to tribal welfare.


**1. With reference to global hunger initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Established the World Food Programme
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                              :   Focuses solely on micronutrient deficiencies
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                 :   Launched by the UN Secretary-General
4. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty   :   Includes 91 countries and 25 international organizations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, indeed aims to support efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty, encompassing 91 countries and 25 international organizations.  The other pairs contain inaccuracies.  The NFSA, 2013, while crucial for food security in India, did not establish the World Food Programme (WFP); the WFP is a separate UN agency. POSHAN Abhiyan addresses broader nutritional issues beyond just micronutrient deficiencies; it aims to improve overall nutrition levels in children and women. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is a commitment from countries to combat various forms of malnutrition, but it wasn't launched by the UN Secretary-General; it's a collaborative declaration among nations.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairing.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs.


**2. With reference to global university rankings, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                                     Key Characteristic
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025        :   Top-ranked Indian Institution is Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham
2. University Impact Rankings 2024            :   Published by Times Higher Education (THE)
3. World University Rankings 2025            :   Based on 9 performance indicators
4. NIRF 2024                                   :   Includes 18 indicators to assess institutions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The QS World University Rankings uses multiple performance indicators, not just 9, and IIT Bombay was the top-ranked Indian institution, not Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham. The University Impact Rankings 2024 are published by THE, but it is not the publisher of the World University Rankings 2025. The World University Rankings 2025 uses 18 indicators, not 9, as stated in pair 3. Finally, NIRF 2024 uses its own set of parameters, not the 18 mentioned in pair 4.  Therefore, all the pairs are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. The distractors aim to confuse the candidate by using closely related but incorrect information.


**3. With reference to foreign university campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Policy                       Specific Detail
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Requires foreign universities to be ranked in the global top 100
2. National Education Policy 2020           :   Specifically prohibits foreign university campuses
3. Letter of Intent (LoI) to the University of Southampton:   First international university to establish a campus under the 2023 regulations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The University of Southampton receiving a Letter of Intent (LoI) marks it as the first international university to establish a campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023.  The other pairs are incorrect. The UGC regulations of 2023 require foreign universities to be ranked in the global top 500, not top 100 as stated in pair 1.  The National Education Policy 2020 does not prohibit foreign university campuses; instead, it encourages their establishment, and pair 2 is thus incorrect. Therefore, only option (c) is correct. The other options incorrectly include pairs with false information, designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the regulations and policy details.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

   NIRF Aspect                                   Detail
1.  Year of Launch                             :   2020
2.  Implementing Agency                       :   University Grants Commission (UGC)
3.  Top-ranked University in Overall Category 2024:   IISC Bangalore
4.  Additional Category in 2024 Rankings      :   Skill Universities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Skill Universities were indeed added as a new category in the 2024 NIRF rankings. The other pairs are incorrect. NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2020, making pair 1 incorrect.  The implementing agency is the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre, not the UGC, making pair 2 incorrect. IIT Madras, not IISC Bangalore, topped the overall category in 2024, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of NIRF details.  The distractors are designed to test if the candidate can recall specific facts accurately.


**5. With reference to global gender equality reports, consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                     Key Finding/Feature
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             :   India ranked 1st in South Asia
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022       :   Top 3 countries were Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland
3. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)             :   Based on 14 indicators across four key dimensions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The GII 2022 report indeed listed Denmark, Norway, and Switzerland as top-ranking countries.  The GGGI is correctly described as using 14 indicators across four dimensions.  Pair 1 is incorrect; India was not ranked 1st in South Asia in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024. Therefore, only option (b) is the correct answer. The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's knowledge of specific rankings and report details, emphasizing the need for precise recall of data.


**6. With reference to amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                 Description
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency              :   Requires a communicable disease to have only a high risk of wide geographical spread
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism:   Focuses exclusively on developed countries
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities         :   Aims to improve coordination among countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The creation of National IHR Authorities aims to improve coordination among countries in handling public health emergencies.  Pair 1 is incorrect because a pandemic emergency is defined as exceeding or potentially exceeding national health systems’ response capabilities, not just having a high risk of wide geographical spread. Pair 2 is incorrect; the financial mechanism aims to help developing countries, not focus exclusively on developed ones. Therefore, only option (c) is correct.  The distractors illustrate subtle but important differences in the actual amendments, testing thorough understanding.


**7. With reference to the ASMITA Project and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. ASMITA Project                               :   Focuses solely on English and Hindi translation
2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                         :   A multilingual dictionary repository
3. Real-time Translation Architecture            :   Aims to enhance translation using cutting-edge technology

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is indeed a multilingual dictionary repository, and the Real-time Translation Architecture aims to use advanced technology for translation.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the ASMITA project aims to provide study materials in 22 scheduled languages, not just English and Hindi.  Therefore, only option (c) is correct. The distractors aim to test the candidate's detailed understanding of the project's scope and objectives.


**8. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Report Aspect                                    Detail
1.  Theme                                          :   Focuses solely on reducing food waste
2.  New Definition of Financing for Food Security:   Includes both public and private financial resources
3.  Status of SDG 2 (Zero Hunger)                   :   World is on track to achieve the goal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The report's new definition of financing for food security and nutrition accurately includes both public and private resources, both domestic and foreign. Pair 1 is incorrect; the theme is broader than just reducing food waste; it encompasses financing to end hunger and malnutrition. Pair 3 is incorrect; the world is far from achieving SDG 2.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct. The distractors test the candidate's comprehension of the report's overall message and specific details.


**9.  With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following pairs:**

   GNAFC Aspect                                   Detail
1. Year of Launch                               :   2024
2. Key Report Produced                           :   Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
3. Founding Organizations                         :   Includes the World Health Organization (WHO)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The GNAFC does produce the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC). Pair 1 is incorrect; the GNAFC was launched in 2016, not 2024. Pair 3 is incorrect; the WHO is not a founding organization; the founding organizations include the European Union, FAO, and WFP. Therefore, only option (b) is correct.  The distractors are designed to check the candidate's knowledge of the GNAFC's establishment and activities.


**10. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Report Aspect                                    Detail
1.  Key Data Tracked                               :   Food waste at the production level only
2.  Collaborating Organizations                      :   Includes the World Bank
3.  Type of Report                                 :   Produced biennially


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Pair 1 is incorrect because the report tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels in addition to production. Pair 2 is incorrect; the World Bank is not involved in the report; the collaboration is between UNEP and WRAP. Pair 3 is incorrect; the report is produced annually, not biennially. Therefore, option (d) is correct. The distractors highlight common misconceptions surrounding the scope and details of the report.


**1. With reference to Indian Higher Education Rankings, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking                               Institution
1. QS World University Rankings 2025     :   Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham (Top Ranked Indian University)
2. University Impact Rankings 2024      :   Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (Top Ranked Indian Institution)
3. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Top Ranked Indian University)
4. NIRF 2024 Overall Category           :   Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore (Top Ranked University)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings 2025 lists Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024.  This is a distinct ranking system focusing on universities' contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Option (a) is incorrect because, while Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham features prominently in the University Impact Rankings, it is not the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings.  IIT Bombay holds that position. Option (c) is incorrect because while IISc Bangalore topped the NIRF 2024 Universities category, it's not the top-ranked university overall in the NIRF rankings; IIT Madras secured that position.  Option (d) combines the errors present in options (a) and (c).  Only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the top-ranked Indian universities according to their respective ranking systems.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various ranking systems and their respective top performers, highlighting the nuanced landscape of higher education rankings in India.  It also assesses factual recall of institutional names and the ability to correctly match them to the given ranking frameworks.


**2. With reference to Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Policy                                     Key Feature
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Requires Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked in the global top 500.
2. National Education Policy 2020                       :   Facilitates the entry of top-ranked foreign universities.
3. Letter of Intent (LoI) issued to University of Southampton :  First international university to establish a campus in India under the 2023 regulations.
4.  UGC Regulations 2023                               :  Allows for collaboration between multiple FHEIs to set up campuses.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, explicitly state that foreign universities must be ranked within the global top 500 to establish campuses in India.  The National Education Policy 2020 envisions an increase in international collaboration in higher education, which includes facilitating the entry of top-ranked foreign universities. The University of Southampton received a Letter of Intent (LoI), making it the first to establish a campus under the 2023 regulations. The regulations also allow for collaborations between multiple FHEIs to set up campuses.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent policy developments in Indian higher education, their understanding of the regulatory framework governing foreign university campuses, and their ability to link policy objectives with implementation strategies. The inclusion of the University of Southampton adds a layer of specificity, testing awareness of current affairs in the higher education sector.  The question also assesses the candidate's analytical skills in evaluating the interconnectedness of different policy measures and their impact on the Indian higher education system.


**3. With reference to Global Rankings and Indian Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking System                                       Top Ranked Indian Institution
1. QS World University Rankings 2025                  :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
2. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025:   Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B)
3.  NIRF 2024 Overall Category                       :    IIT Madras
4. University Impact Rankings 2024                    :    Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

IIT Madras topped the overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the top-ranked Indian institutions in the QS World University Rankings 2025 and the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025.  The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of different ranking methodologies and their application to Indian institutions. It tests factual recall of institutional names and their performance in various ranking systems. The inclusion of both global and national ranking systems adds a layer of complexity, demanding a nuanced understanding of the Indian higher education landscape within a global context.  The question also assesses the candidate's analytical skills in comparing and contrasting different ranking frameworks and their implications for understanding the relative strengths of Indian institutions.


**4. With reference to Initiatives Promoting Multilingualism in Education, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                              Key Feature
1. Asmita Project                                      :   Production of 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages in 5 years.
2. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh                               :   A comprehensive multilingual dictionary repository.
3. Real-time Translation Architecture                     :   Enhancing translation using cutting-edge technology.
4.  National Education Policy 2020                       :   Launched Asmita Project, Bahubhasha Shabdkosh, and Real-time Translation Architecture.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Asmita Project aims to produce study materials in various Indian languages. Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual dictionary. The Real-time Translation Architecture utilizes technology for improved translation.  The National Education Policy 2020 indeed launched all three initiatives to promote multilingualism.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of government initiatives promoting multilingualism in education.  It assesses their understanding of the objectives and features of these initiatives, demonstrating knowledge of current affairs in the education sector. The inclusion of the National Education Policy 2020 as a linking factor adds a layer of complexity, requiring the candidate to understand the policy context within which these initiatives operate.  The question tests the candidate’s analytical skills in identifying the interconnectedness of different government programs aimed at achieving a specific policy goal.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative             Focus Area
1. PMGKAY                                  :   Providing free food grains to the elderly
2. PM-ABHIM                               :   Enhanced access to quality health facilities for Scheduled Tribes
3. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana    :   Providing financial assistance for adoption
4. National Food Security Act, 2013       :   Recognizing the right to food as a fundamental right
5. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0    :   Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) primarily aims to provide free food grains to a large section of the poor population, not exclusively the elderly.  Option 1 is incorrect because of this broad scope.  Option 3 is incorrect as Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance to pregnant women and lactating mothers, not for adoption. Option 5 is also incorrect; Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focuses on supplementary nutrition and not on school infrastructure.  The correct pairs are 2 and 4. PM-ABHIM (Ayushman Bharat Health Infrastructure Mission) indeed focuses on enhancing access to quality health facilities for Scheduled Tribes. The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a statutory right.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                         Key Provision
1.  The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 :  Prohibition of surrogacy for same-sex couples
2.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules, 2022   :  Limitation on the number of surrogacy attempts per surrogate mother
3. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024 :  Allows surrogacy only for married couples
4. Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :  Sets gestational limits for legal abortions
5. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023        :  Defines cruelty towards married women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ART Act of 2021 primarily regulates ART clinics and banks, aiming for safe and ethical practices but doesn't specifically prohibit surrogacy for same-sex couples.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules of 2022 indeed limit the number of surrogacy attempts per surrogate mother to three.  The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, while regulating surrogacy, don't explicitly restrict it to only married couples. The MTP Act of 1971 is correctly paired with its gestational limits for legal abortions.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, includes provisions addressing cruelty towards married women.  Therefore, option (c) correctly matches the acts/regulations with their key provisions.


**3. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                         Key Finding/Ranking
1.  Global Gender Gap Report 2024      :   India ranked among the top 10 countries globally
2.  Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022   :   India ranked lower than Bangladesh
3.  Global Gender Gap Report 2024      :  Health and Survival gender gap closed by 96% globally
4.  Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022   :   Denmark ranked among the top three countries
5. Global Gender Gap Report 2024       : India ranked higher than Sri Lanka


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 did not rank India among the top 10 countries.  The GII 2022 indeed placed India lower than Bangladesh.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly reported that the Health and Survival gender gap is closed by 96% globally.  Denmark was ranked among the top three countries in the GII 2022. Option 5 is also correct as the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 shows India ranked lower than Sri Lanka. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.


**4. With reference to health expenditure in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Health Expenditure                 Percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE)
1. Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health :  Increased to 10%
2. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) :  Remained below 6%
3. External/Donor Funding for health           :  Increased to 1.5%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health decreased to 8.7% from 9.0%.  Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) increased to 7.4% from 5.8%, exceeding 6%. External/Donor Funding increased to 1.1% from 0.5%, remaining below 1.5%.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option.


**5. With reference to the World Health Assembly (WHA) and the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Regulation                         Characteristic/Amendment
1.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005  :  First established in 1995
2.  World Health Assembly (WHA)              :  Sets the policies of the World Health Organization
3.  Amendments to IHR, 2005                  :  Established a global fund for pandemic preparedness
4.  World Health Assembly (WHA)              :  Comprises representatives from all UN member states
5.  Amendments to IHR, 2005                  : Defined pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with a wide geographical spread

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IHR, 2005, is not from 1995, it's a successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951). The WHA does indeed determine the policies of the WHO. While the amendments to the IHR introduced a coordinating financial mechanism, it's not a global fund in the conventional sense.  The WHA comprises all 194 WHO Member States, not all UN member states. The amendments did define pandemic emergencies as communicable diseases with wide geographical spread or high risk thereof.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                    Specific Right/Recognition
1.  Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes  :   Forest Rights under FRA
2.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                :   Recognition as 'criminal tribes' under British law
3.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Habitat rights under Section 3(1)(e) of FRA
4.  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes        :  Always categorized as DNTs
5.  Scheduled Tribes                         :  Automatic inclusion as PVTGs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes received habitat rights, a component of forest rights under the Forest Rights Act (FRA). Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were indeed historically categorized as 'criminal tribes' under British law.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) are granted habitat rights under Section 3(1)(e) of the FRA.  Not all nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes are DNTs; this is an incorrect statement.  Scheduled Tribes are not automatically included as PVTGs; PVTG status is a separate designation within the Scheduled Tribes.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                 Key Indicator/Measurement
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024           :   Measures only child stunting
2.  Food Waste Index Report 2024            :  Tracks food waste only at the household level
3.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :  Focuses solely on domestic financing for food security
4.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)     :  Produced by the World Food Programme (WFP) exclusively
5.  Food Waste Index Report 2024            : Supports indicators of SDG 12.3


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 measures multiple indicators related to hunger, not just child stunting. The Food Waste Index Report tracks food waste at both retail and consumer levels. The State of Food Security and Nutrition report considers both domestic and foreign financial resources. The GRFC is a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations, not just the WFP. Only the fifth pair is correctly matched; the Food Waste Index Report does support indicators of SDG 12.3.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Act                                   Description/Feature
1.  National Medical Register (NMR) Portal       :   Mandated under Section 31 of the Indian Medical Council Act, 2019
2.  SPARSH                                        :   A digital pension system for Defence Pensioners managed by Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs)
3.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment : Launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Medical Register (NMR) Portal is indeed mandated under Section 31 of the National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, not the Indian Medical Council Act.  This is a crucial distinction, as the NMC replaced the Medical Council of India.  The description accurately reflects the portal's purpose as a comprehensive database for registered allopathic doctors.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched, albeit with a minor correction needed regarding the act.

SPARSH is correctly described as a digital pension system streamlining processes for Defence Pensioners.  The involvement of Village Level Entrepreneurs (VLEs) selected by Local Military Authorities (LMAs) is also accurate. Thus, pair 2 is correctly matched.

The NQAS assessment is correctly linked to AAMs and IPHLs. However, the statement's limitation to only these two institutions is potentially misleading. While the text focuses on these, it doesn't explicitly exclude other potential applications of NQAS.  Therefore, while not entirely incorrect, pair 3 lacks complete accuracy and is a less strong match compared to the other two.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                   Key Provision/Feature
1.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971  :   Allows abortion beyond 24 weeks in cases of foetal abnormalities only upon advice of a Medical Board
2.  Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024   :   Prohibits surrogacy with donor gametes
3.  Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021 : Establishes National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The MTP Act, 1971, as amended in 2021, does indeed allow for abortions beyond 24 weeks under specific circumstances, primarily involving severe foetal abnormalities, requiring the advice of a Medical Board.  This makes pair 1 correct.

The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, *changed* the previous rule that prohibited the use of donor gametes. Now, under certain medical conditions, it allows for surrogacy using donor gametes, provided the District Medical Board certifies the need. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021, correctly establishes the NARTSB to oversee and regulate ART services.  This makes pair 3 correct.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health-related initiative/program                    Description/Objective
1.  PM-JAY                                          :   Government-funded health insurance scheme included in Social Security Expenditure (SSE)
2.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                   :   Tracks global food waste at retail and consumer levels, contributing to SDG 12.3.1 (b)
3.  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)    :   Promotes nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY) is accurately described as a government-funded health insurance scheme, and it is explicitly mentioned as a component of Social Security Expenditure (SSE).  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 accurately tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels. Its alignment with SDG 12.3.1 (b) regarding halving per capita global food waste is also correct.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is correctly described in its objective to promote nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to reduce gender inequalities and enhance business resilience.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agency                           Function/Responsibility
1.  World Health Organization (WHO)               :   Certifies countries as malaria-free
2.  National Anti-Doping Agency (NADA)           :  Operates under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports and implements the anti-doping programme in India
3.  World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)            :   Coordinates anti-doping activities through its Anti-Doping Administration & Management System (ADAMS)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The WHO's role in certifying countries as malaria-free is accurately reflected in the provided text, making pair 1 correct.

NADA's function as an autonomous body under the Ministry of Youth Affairs & Sports, responsible for implementing India's anti-doping program, is also accurately described, making pair 2 correct.

WADA's function, including its use of ADAMS to coordinate anti-doping activities globally, is correctly stated, making pair 3 correct.  All three pairs are accurately matched.


**5. With reference to euthanasia and related legal frameworks in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Case/Act                            Key Ruling/Provision
1.  Aruna Shanbaug case (2011)              :   First recognized the legality of passive euthanasia in India
2.  Common Cause vs. Union of India (2018) :   Upheld the right to die with dignity as a fundamental right under Article 21
3.  MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021               :   Allows abortion only up to 20 weeks of pregnancy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Aruna Shanbaug case (2011) is correctly linked to the Supreme Court's first recognition of the legality of passive euthanasia.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Common Cause case (2018) accurately reflects the Supreme Court's upholding of the right to die with dignity under Article 21, further solidifying the legal framework for passive euthanasia.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021, did increase the permissible gestational limit for abortion,  it does *not* restrict abortions to only 20 weeks.  It allows for abortions up to 24 weeks under certain conditions and beyond 24 weeks in specific cases with medical board approval.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                      Focus Area
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Improvement of healthcare infrastructure in tribal areas
2.  Asmita Project                        : Promotion of multilingualism in higher education
3.  National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) :  Providing supplementary nutrition to children under five
4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment :  Assessment of Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, encompassing various sectors including health, education, and livelihood. While healthcare is a component, it's not the sole focus.  The Asmita Project, under the Union Ministry of Education, focuses on promoting multilingualism in education by providing high-quality study materials in various Indian languages. The National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), Aadharshila, focuses on the holistic development of children aged three to six years.  The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is indeed for evaluating Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) to ensure quality healthcare services. Option (a) is incorrect as PM-JUGA's scope extends beyond healthcare. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched Asmita Project. Option (d) is incorrect because the Aadharshila curriculum does not primarily focus on supplementary nutrition; it's a comprehensive early childhood education program.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                       Key Provision/Feature
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                :  Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
2.  Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :  Establishes an anti-doping helpline for athletes
3.  International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005 :  Defines "Pandemic emergency" for communicable diseases
4. Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :  Harmonizes anti-doping legislation internationally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1,2,3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs, a crucial aspect of their protection and well-being. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is unrelated to anti-doping measures; that falls under different legislation and agencies.  The International Convention against Doping in Sport, 2005, addresses doping in sports, not the definition of pandemic emergencies.  The definition of a pandemic emergency is a key amendment to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005,  not a feature of the original convention.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The other pairs incorrectly link acts and policies with provisions that are not directly associated with them.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Health Indicator                       Trend in 2021-22 (compared to 2017-18)
1. Total Health Expenditure (THE) as percent of GDP : Decreased
2. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as percent of THE : Increased
3. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as percent of THE : Increased
4. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as percent of THE : Decreased

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

According to the provided data, the Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased in 2021-22 compared to 2017-18. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE also increased during the same period.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) decreased as a percentage of THE, and Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) increased as a percentage of THE. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly represent the trends of health indicators as given in the source.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                       Role/Function
1. World Health Organization (WHO)         :  Released the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024
2. Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe :  Established a Coordinating Financial Mechanism for IHR implementation
3.  Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports    :  Launched the Aadharshila curriculum
4.  Ministry of Women and Child Development: Released the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is not directly involved in releasing the Global Hunger Index (GHI).  The GHI is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The Coordinating Financial Mechanism is established as a result of the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, not by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The Aadharshila curriculum was launched by the Ministry of Women and Child Development, and the Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 was released by the Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The other options incorrectly attribute roles and functions to the organizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Terminology                                 Definition/Description
1. Passive Euthanasia                          :  Practice of ending a patient's life to limit suffering
2.  Dyslexia                                    :  A learning disability affecting reading or writing
3.  Greenwashing                               :  A marketing strategy falsely promoting products as environmentally friendly
4.  Plankton Bloom                              :  A sudden increase in the population of only phytoplanktons
5.  Permafrost                                  :  Ground that remains frozen for at least ten years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Passive euthanasia accurately describes the practice of withdrawing life support to alleviate suffering. Dyslexia is correctly defined as a learning disability affecting reading and/or writing skills. Greenwashing correctly describes a deceptive marketing tactic. Permafrost accurately describes ground that remains frozen for a prolonged period. However, a plankton bloom involves both phytoplankton and zooplankton, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a) omits greenwashing and permafrost. Option (b) incorrectly includes the inaccurate definition of a plankton bloom. Option (d) includes the incorrect definition of a plankton bloom.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization          Report/Initiative
1. UN Environment Programme (UNEP)     :   Global Gender Gap Report 2024
2. World Economic Forum (WEF)         :   Food Waste Index Report 2024
3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO):   Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
4. United Nations Development Programme (UNDP): Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is one of the five UN agencies that releases the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report and is also involved in the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), which produces the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC).  The other pairs are incorrect. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is associated with the Food Waste Index Report, not the Global Gender Gap Report, which is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The UNDP publishes the Gender Inequality Index (GII), not the Global Hunger Index (GHI), which is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe.  Understanding the roles and responsibilities of these various international organizations is crucial for comprehending global initiatives related to food security, nutrition, and gender equality. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific organizations and their respective reports and initiatives, demonstrating a strong understanding of global governance and development issues.

1. SDG 12.3.1 (a), Food Loss Index (FLI) :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2. SDG 12.3.1 (b), Food Waste Index (FWI):   UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. SDG 2, Zero Hunger                  :   International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) is one of the five UN agencies involved in monitoring progress towards SDG 2, Zero Hunger.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), not the World Food Programme (WFP). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), specifically the indicators related to food waste and hunger, and their associated custodian agencies.  It highlights the interconnectedness of global goals and the roles of different international organizations in their implementation and monitoring.  The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar organizations and their functions.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Financial Pillar of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty focuses on mobilizing resources, including from governments and NGOs. The Knowledge Pillar facilitates the sharing of best practices and information among member countries. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Policy Basket is not limited to national strategies but encompasses a broader range of policy instruments. Pair 2 is incorrect; the National Pillar emphasizes national-level actions, not international collaborations.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, its structure, and its components. It requires the candidate to analyze the functions of each pillar and correctly match them to their descriptions, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of this global initiative.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Scheme                     Ministry/Organization
1.  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM)     :   Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL):   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment: Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare
4.  Spot Food License Initiative          :   Food Safety and Standards Authority of India

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) and the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment fall under the purview of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. The Spot Food License Initiative is implemented through the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS), managed by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. Pair 1 is incorrect; Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) are not directly under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs but are part of the broader healthcare infrastructure. Pair 3 is incorrect; the NQAS Assessment is not related to the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. This question tests the candidate's understanding of various government initiatives related to healthcare and food safety, requiring knowledge of the ministries and organizations responsible for their implementation.  The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the candidate's ability to accurately match initiatives to the correct government bodies.


**5. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following pairs:**

    Tribe                                    State

4. Dongria Kondhs                          :   Odisha
5. Kamars                                  :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The Juangs and Dongria Kondhs are tribes in Odisha that have been granted habitat rights under the Forest Rights Act, 2006.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. The Bharias are a tribe in Madhya Pradesh, not Chhattisgarh. The Kamars are in Chhattisgarh, not Maharashtra.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India and their relationship to the Forest Rights Act.  It requires careful recall of specific tribal groups and their locations, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of India's tribal demographics and the legal framework protecting their rights.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to avoid making hasty generalizations based on partial knowledge.



**6. With reference to Vulnerable Groups, consider the following pairs:**

    Vulnerable Group                       Defining Characteristic
1. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)             :   Historically nomadic, engaged in agriculture
2. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):  Pre-agricultural level of existence, declining population
3. Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes      :   Always associated with criminal activities
4.  Habitual Offenders                   :  Always members of DNTs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  PVTGs are characterized by their pre-agricultural lifestyle, declining populations, low literacy, and subsistence economies.  The other pairs are incorrect. DNTs are not always historically nomadic or engaged primarily in agriculture; their occupations are diverse. Nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes are not inherently associated with criminal activities; this is a harmful stereotype.  Habitual offenders are not always members of DNTs;  this is a generalization. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the defining characteristics of various vulnerable groups in India. It requires a nuanced understanding of the socio-economic conditions and historical context of these groups, and the ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate generalizations.


**7. With reference to reports on gender inequality, consider the following pairs:**

    Report                                      Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024            :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022       :   World Economic Forum (WEF)
3.  The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains : Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) released the report, ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP. The Gender Inequality Index (GII) is released by the UNDP, not the WEF. This question assesses the candidate’s ability to link reports on gender inequality with the correct publishing organizations. It tests knowledge of key reports and organizations involved in gender-related research and advocacy, demonstrating understanding of global efforts to promote gender equality. The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and their publications.


**8.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                           Key Provision
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act): Defines sexual harassment based on the Vishaka judgment.
2. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013: Guarantees a minimum wage for agricultural workers.
3. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA): Defines habitat rights for PVTGs.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The POSH Act defines sexual harassment in accordance with the Vishaka judgment. The FRA, 2006, explicitly defines habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). Pair 2 is incorrect; while the NFSA, 2013, concerns food security, it does not guarantee a minimum wage for agricultural workers. That is addressed by other labor laws.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key Indian legislation related to women's rights, food security, and tribal rights.  It demands precise knowledge of the provisions of each Act and tests the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding but distinct legal frameworks.  The distractor in pair 2 is carefully chosen to test the candidate's understanding of the specific provisions of the NFSA.


**9. With reference to health initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Program                       Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY): Provides financial assistance for the birth of the second child.
2. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0: Aims to improve supplementary nutrition for children.
3.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY): Provides free food grains to the poorest citizens.
4.  National Health Mission: Focuses solely on immunisation through Mobile Medical Units.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 are indeed focused on improving supplementary nutrition for children.  PMGKAY does provide free food grains to a large segment of the poorest citizens.  Pair 1 is incorrect; PMMVY provides financial assistance for the birth of the *first* child, not the second. Pair 4 is incorrect; while the National Health Mission utilizes Mobile Medical Units for immunization, it has a broader scope than solely focusing on immunization through this method. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various Indian government health initiatives. It requires accurate recall of the key features of each program, testing the ability to distinguish between similar programs and their specific objectives. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to avoid making assumptions based on partial knowledge.


**10. With reference to euthanasia guidelines, consider the following pairs:**

    Board/Committee                       Function
1. Primary Medical Board (PMB)         :   Final decision on LST withdrawal.
2. Secondary Medical Board (SMB)        :   Reviews and validates PMB decisions.
3. Clinical Ethics Committee             :   Provides legal counsel to the family.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Primary Medical Board (PMB) makes the initial proposal for withdrawing Life Sustaining Treatments (LST), and the Secondary Medical Board (SMB) reviews and validates that decision. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Clinical Ethics Committee's role is related to audit, oversight, and conflict resolution, not providing legal counsel.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the procedural aspects of the euthanasia guidelines. It requires knowledge of the roles and responsibilities of the various medical boards and committees involved in the process. The distractor in pair 3 is designed to test the candidate's ability to recall the specific functions of the Clinical Ethics Committee, avoiding confusion with other aspects of the legal process.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                    State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                          :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                 :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                             :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                         :   Chhattisgarh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are indeed found in Chhattisgarh, and Maria Gonds are a tribal group residing in Maharashtra.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a tribal group primarily located in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  Finally, the Dongria Kondhs are primarily found in Odisha, not Chhattisgarh. This question tests factual recall of tribal groups and their geographical distribution across Indian states, a topic relevant to understanding India's diverse demography and social dynamics.  The incorrect options act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related but distinct tribal groups and their locations.  The question also assesses the candidate's ability to analyze information and eliminate incorrect options based on their knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                     Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana :   Provides supplementary nutrition to bridge dietary gaps.
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana    :   Provides financial assistance for housing and infrastructure.
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0      :   Provides free food grains to the poor.
4. National Food Security Act, 2013        :   Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched. The National Food Security Act, 2013, explicitly recognizes the right to food as a legal entitlement for eligible citizens. The other statements incorrectly pair schemes with their features. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) focuses on providing free food grains to the poor, not supplementary nutrition. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) offers financial assistance to mothers for the well-being of their children, not for housing and infrastructure. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to improve supplementary nutrition, not provide free food grains. This question tests the candidate's understanding of various Indian government schemes related to food security and nutrition.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring the candidate to possess detailed knowledge of these schemes to select the correct option. The question assesses both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding government initiatives.


**3. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                      GHI Score for India
1. 2023                                     :   27.3
2. 2024                                     :   18.3
3. 2000                                     :   Higher than 2024 score
4.  2023                                    :   Ranked 105th out of 127 countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  India's GHI score in 2023 was indeed 27.3, and it was ranked 105th out of 127 countries. The other pairs are incorrect. The global GHI score in 2024 was 18.3, not India's score.  Furthermore, India's GHI score in 2000 was considerably higher than its score in 2024, reflecting improvements over time but still indicating a serious level of hunger. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the Global Hunger Index, specifically focusing on India's performance.  The incorrect options present plausible distractors, challenging the candidate's ability to recall the precise data and distinguish between global and national GHI scores.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to interpret data related to global development indices.


**4. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                   Custodian Organization
1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                   :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                  :   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
3. SDG 12.3.1 (a)                          :   Focuses on reducing per capita food waste.
4. SDG 12.3.1 (b)                          :   Focuses on reducing food losses along production and supply chains.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. SDG 12.3.1 (b) indeed focuses on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels, with UNEP being the custodian organization for the Food Waste Index (FWI). The other pairs are incorrect. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), not UNEP.  SDG 12.3.1 (a) focuses on reducing food losses along the production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses, the opposite of what is stated in option 3.  Option 2 is incorrect because FWI focuses on reducing per capita food waste at retail and consumer levels; SDG 12.3.1 (a) is related to food loss along the supply chain. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of sustainable development goals (SDGs) and their related indicators.  The incorrect options act as effective distractors, requiring the candidate to have a clear understanding of the specific focus of each SDG and its associated metrics.  This question assesses both factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related concepts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Initiative/Report
1. Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) :   Food Waste Index Report 2024
2. UN Environment Programme (UNEP)          :   Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)
3. Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP):   The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains report
4. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN):   Food Waste Index Report 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) is associated with the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), not the Food Waste Index Report 2024.  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), along with WRAP, launched the Food Waste Index Report 2024, not the GRFC.  The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) collaborated with UNEP on the Food Waste Index Report, not the GAIN report.  Finally, the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) released ‘The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains’ report, not the Food Waste Index Report 2024. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various international organizations working on food security and nutrition issues.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge and the ability to differentiate between the mandates and activities of similar organizations.  The question effectively tests factual recall and the ability to link organizations to their specific initiatives.

2. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham              :   Top-ranked Indian institution in QS World University Rankings, 2025.
3.  University of Southampton               :   First international university to set up a campus in India under UGC Regulations, 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The University of Southampton was indeed the first international university to establish a campus in India under the UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023. The other pairs are incorrect. IIT-B was the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025, not in the University Impact Rankings 2024. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not in the QS rankings. This question tests the candidate's understanding of global university rankings and the recent development of foreign university campuses in India.  The incorrect pairings provide challenging distractors, requiring the candidate to possess specific knowledge of university rankings and policy developments. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between different ranking systems and their implications.

3. 2024                                     :   17th session of the Conference of State Parties took place.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD indeed took place in 2024. The other pairs are incorrect.  The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006, not 2008, and it entered into force in 2008, not 2006. This question tests the candidate's awareness of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and its timeline.  The incorrect options are effective distractors, requiring the candidate to have precise knowledge of the convention's adoption and entry into force. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of international human rights conventions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    Mission/Scheme                           Funding Source
1. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan:  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
2. PM-JUGA                                  : Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants
3. PM-JANMAN                               :  Ministry of Tourism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is indeed funded from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  The other pairs are incorrect. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is not the primary funding source for PM-JUGA.  While PM-JANMAN might have informed the design of PM-JUGA, it is not a direct funding source.  The Ministry of Tourism is involved in some components of PM-JUGA, such as Tribal Home Stays, but it is not the primary funding source. This question tests the candidate's understanding of government schemes related to tribal development and their funding mechanisms. The incorrect options are strong distractors, requiring the candidate to have a clear understanding of the funding sources for different schemes.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to analyze the source of funding for government initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                        Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provision of supplementary nutrition to bridge the gap between Recommended Dietary Allowance and Average Daily Intake
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana          :  Registered women receive ₹5000 on the birth of their first child
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0           : Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor people

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) provides financial assistance of ₹5000 to pregnant women and lactating mothers for the birth of their first child.  This is accurately reflected in pair 2.  Pair 1 incorrectly attributes the supplementary nutrition program to PMGKAY; this is actually a feature of Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0. PMGKAY's primary focus is on providing free food grains to the poor, a characteristic wrongly assigned to Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 in pair 3.  The other options are incorrect because they include the mismatched pairs 1 and 3. The question tests factual recall of government schemes and their core functionalities, crucial for understanding India's social welfare initiatives.  Understanding the nuances of these schemes is essential for analyzing government policies related to nutrition and poverty alleviation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Report/Index
1. Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe     :   Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) report
2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)     :   Global Hunger Index (GHI)
3. UN Environment Programme (UNEP) with WRAP :   State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, making pair 1 incorrect. The FAO is involved in the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), but it does not solely produce the GHI.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the FAO is involved in many reports but not specifically the GHI. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP), in collaboration with WRAP, publishes the Food Waste Index Report, not the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report.  Therefore, pair 3 is also incorrect.  However, the FAO is a key player in global food security and nutrition, and UNEP's involvement in food waste is significant. The correct answer highlights the accurate association between UNEP/WRAP and the Food Waste Index Report and the FAO's role in various food security initiatives.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their respective reports, crucial for understanding global food security challenges.

3. Maria Gond                                    :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paudi Bhuyans are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) residing in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, making pair 1 incorrect. The Bharias are a PVTG found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha; therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. The Maria Gond tribe is indeed located in Maharashtra, making pair 3 correct. The question tests knowledge of Indian tribal groups and their geographical distribution, an important aspect of understanding India's diverse population and its socio-economic complexities.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise geographical locations associated with specific tribal groups.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                       Key Provision
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :  Defines 'habitat' as the area comprising the customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests of primitive tribal groups
2. National Food Security Act, 2013              :   Recognizes the right to adequate and nutritious food as a statutory right
3. Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024     :   Aims to integrate sports with education in line with NEP 2020

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA), indeed defines "habitat" as specified in pair 1. The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food, as correctly stated in pair 2.  The Draft National Sports Policy 2024 explicitly aims to integrate sports with education, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020, making pair 3 correct as well. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key Indian legislation and policies, assessing their understanding of legal frameworks related to tribal rights, food security, and sports development.  All three pairs represent accurate matches, demonstrating a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Focus Area
1. World Food Programme                      : Combating hunger through food aid and nutrition enhancement
2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)   :  Implementing the Pandemic Fund Project
3. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty : Eradicating hunger and poverty, reducing inequalities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Food Programme (WFP) is accurately described in pair 1 as a UN branch focused on combating global hunger through food assistance, promoting food security, and improving nutrition.  This aligns perfectly with its established mission and ongoing activities.

Pair 2 incorrectly links the FAO to the Pandemic Fund Project's implementation. While the FAO is involved in various global food security initiatives, the Pandemic Fund Project is implemented by the Asian Development Bank (ADB), the World Bank, and the FAO – making the statement about FAO's *sole* implementation inaccurate.

Pair 3 correctly identifies the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty's core goals. The alliance aims to eradicate hunger and poverty (aligning with SDGs 1 and 2) and to simultaneously reduce inequalities (SDG 10).  Its multi-faceted approach makes this a true statement.

Therefore, only pair 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option.  The other options include pairings that contain inaccuracies, making them incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                         Key Characteristic
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :  Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)        : Published annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024               : Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, supporting SDG 12.3.1 (b)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2024 indeed focuses on financing mechanisms to combat hunger and malnutrition, reflecting a key shift in addressing food insecurity. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), as stated, is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), providing crucial data on global food crises. Finally, the Food Waste Index Report 2024 accurately tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, directly contributing to the achievement of SDG 12.3.1 (b), which aims to halve per capita global food waste. Therefore, the correct answer is (d), as all three pairs are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Implementing Agency/Organization
1. POSHAN Abhiyan                           : World Health Organization (WHO)
2. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment : Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
3. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) :  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is indeed launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare in India to improve healthcare facilities.

Pair 1 incorrectly links POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) to the WHO. While WHO collaborates on global nutrition initiatives, POSHAN Abhiyan is a flagship program of the Indian government.

Pair 3 incorrectly links GAIN to UNEP. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) is an independent organization working on nutrition, not directly under UNEP's purview.

Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  The other options include incorrect pairings of initiatives and their implementing bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                 Publishing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024              : United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022         : World Economic Forum (WEF)
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024               : UN Environment Programme (UNEP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed published by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.

Pair 1 incorrectly attributes the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 to UNDP.  This report is actually published by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

Pair 2 incorrectly attributes the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 to the WEF. The GII is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).

Thus, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. The other options include incorrect pairings of reports/indices and their respective publishing organizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Key Feature/Objective
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :  Establishes the right to food as a fundamental right
2. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
3.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition                 : Focuses on eliminating hunger and all forms of malnutrition globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) indeed aims to uplift the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through infrastructure development, skill enhancement, and livelihood improvements. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition accurately focuses on the global eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition, setting targets for improved nutritional outcomes worldwide.

Pair 1 is incorrect because the NFSA, 2013, establishes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right.  While it's a significant step towards food security,  it does not achieve the constitutional status of a fundamental right.

Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings while excluding the inaccurate pairing in option 1.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                      Focus Area
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 :  Combating micronutrient deficiencies
2. POSHAN Abhiyan                           :  Eradicating hunger and malnutrition
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition             :  Recognizing the right to food as a statutory right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is a flagship program of the Government of India aimed at improving nutritional outcomes for children, pregnant women, and lactating mothers.  Its primary focus is on reducing malnutrition in all its forms – including undernutrition, stunting, wasting, and micronutrient deficiencies.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally guarantees subsidized food grains to a significant portion of the Indian population.  While it indirectly contributes to reducing hunger and malnutrition, its core function is not directly combating micronutrient deficiencies; it focuses on providing access to basic food grains. Hence, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.

The Rome Declaration on Nutrition is a global commitment to improve nutrition worldwide. It aims to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition.  Crucially, it does *not* specifically recognize the right to food as a statutory right. That right is primarily enshrined in national laws and constitutions, such as the NFSA in India. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched.  The other options are incorrect due to the mismatching of the initiatives with their respective focus areas.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                 Primary Function
1. World Food Programme (WFP)              :  Launching initiatives to improve nutritious foods value chains
2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)  :  Producing the Global Report on Food Crises
3. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty : Providing food assistance and promoting food security worldwide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024, aims to support and accelerate efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty, while reducing inequalities.  This aligns directly with its stated function, making pair 3 correct.

The World Food Programme (WFP) is a branch of the United Nations focused on providing food assistance, promoting food security, and enhancing nutrition globally.  It does not primarily focus on improving nutritious foods value chains; that is the domain of organizations like GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition).  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) plays a crucial role in global food security, but the Global Report on Food Crises is produced by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), a collaborative effort involving FAO, the World Food Programme (WFP), and the European Union.  Thus, pair 2 is incorrect.  The incorrect options reflect the misattribution of functions to the different organizations.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Report                                        Key Focus

2. Food Waste Index Report 2024                :  Financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)          : Addressing the root causes of food crises

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), launched by the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), aims to better link, integrate, and guide existing initiatives to address the root causes of food crises. This accurately reflects its key focus, making pair 3 correct.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition in all its forms.  It analyzes the financial resources directed towards eradicating these issues, not tracking global food waste.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracks the global and national generation of food waste at retail and consumer levels. It does not directly address financing for food security and nutrition.  This is the focus of the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report.  Hence, pair 2 is incorrect. The incorrect options showcase the confusion between the different reports and their focus.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                      Implementing Agency/Organization

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) NQAS Assessment is implemented by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to promote healthcare for all and is in compliance with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS). This makes pair 2 correctly matched.

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is a government initiative aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India. It is not associated with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP). Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Lakhpati Didi initiative is an outcome of the Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) under the Union Ministry of Rural Development.  It's not associated with GAIN.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.  The other options are incorrect due to the mismatching of initiatives with their implementing agencies.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Index/Report                                 Publisher/Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             : United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
2. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024           : World Economic Forum (WEF)
3. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022        : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 was released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as part of their Human Development Report. This correctly matches pair 3.

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 was published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the WEF. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  The other options incorrectly attribute the publishers/organizations to the respective reports.


**1. With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Role/Function

2. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)      :   Member of GNAFC, focuses on agriculture aspects of food crises
3. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :   Member of GNAFC, handles food aid and distribution during crises
4.  Food Security Information Network (FSIN)    :   Produces the annual Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) for GNAFC
5.  World Humanitarian Summit                 :    Venue for the GNAFC launch in 2016

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GNAFC was indeed launched in 2016 at the World Humanitarian Summit by the European Union, FAO, and WFP.  These three organizations are key members, working collaboratively to address food crises. The FAO's expertise lies in agriculture and sustainable food systems, while the WFP focuses on providing food assistance and logistics.  The FSIN, a crucial part of the GNAFC, is responsible for producing the annual GRFC, providing critical data on food insecurity globally. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the roles of these different organizations within the GNAFC framework is crucial for comprehending global food security initiatives and their interconnectedness. The collaborative nature of the GNAFC highlights the complex, multi-faceted nature of tackling food crises, requiring a coordinated international response.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

2. WRAP (Waste and Resources Action Programme) :   Partner with UNEP in producing the FWI report
3. SDG 12.3.1 (a) (Food Loss Index, FLI)      :   Focuses on reducing food losses along production and supply chains
4. SDG 12.3.1 (b) (Food Waste Index, FWI)     : Aims to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels
5. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)    :   Custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a collaborative effort between UNEP and WRAP. UNEP serves as the custodian of the FWI, while WRAP is a key partner in its development and dissemination.  The report directly contributes to the achievement of SDG 12.3, specifically targeting the reduction of food waste.  SDG 12.3.1 (a) and (b) correctly identify the respective focuses of the FLI and FWI. The FAO is indeed the custodian of the FLI.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect the relationships and responsibilities outlined in the context of the Food Waste Index Report 2024. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.  This question tests the understanding of the global efforts to reduce food waste, highlighting the roles of different international organizations and the linkage to Sustainable Development Goals.  The accurate matching of organizations and their specific responsibilities demonstrates a comprehensive grasp of the subject matter.

(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NQAS assessment is specifically designed for AAMs and IPHLs, ensuring quality standards in these healthcare facilities.  The Spot Food License initiative utilizes the FoSCoS platform to streamline the licensing process. IPHS is a digital platform that monitors public health facilities, and FoSCoS is the IT platform used for the Spot Food License initiative. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is the driving force behind both the NQAS and the Spot Food License initiatives.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the Indian government's initiatives to improve healthcare and food safety. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests knowledge of specific government programs and their mechanisms, demonstrating an understanding of India's public health infrastructure and regulatory frameworks.  The correct matching requires detailed knowledge of the initiatives and their interrelationships.

   Aspect/Finding                                   Specific Data/Detail
1. Global GHI Score                               :   18.3 (considered moderate)
2. India's GHI Rank (out of 127 countries)      :   105th (in the "serious" category)
3. India's GHI Score                               :    27.3
4. Percentage of India's population with undernourishment: 13.7%
5. Organizations that released GHI 2024          : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 report, released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, presented a global GHI score of 18.3, categorized as moderate. India's ranking was 105th out of 127 countries, falling under the "serious" category.  India's specific GHI score was 27.3.  The report indicated that 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment. All five pairs accurately reflect the data and details presented in the GHI 2024 report. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall about the GHI report and its findings, assessing knowledge of global and national hunger levels.  The accurate recall of specific numerical data demonstrates a thorough understanding of the report's key findings and their implications.  The question also tests awareness of the organizations involved in producing the GHI.

   Scheme/Initiative                                  Key Feature/Objective
1. Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in 63,000 villages.
2.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Named after Birsa Munda, and has a 5-year tenure (2024-29).
3.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)     :  Seeks to mobilize ₹50,000 crore for research (₹14,000 crore from the Centre).
4.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024 : Includes new categories for Open Universities and Skill Universities.
5.  Aadharshila (National Curriculum for ECCE)           :  A 48-week curriculum for children aged 3-6 years, based on the Panchakosha concept.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each one:

1. **Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):** This scheme's primary goal is the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities, targeting approximately 63,000 villages for comprehensive development.

2. **Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA):**  The scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda and has a clearly defined 5-year implementation period from 2024-2029.

3. **Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF):** The ANRF aims to significantly boost research and innovation in India, with a substantial funding target of ₹50,000 crore over a period.  The central government's contribution is a key part of this funding plan.

4. **National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024:** The 2024 NIRF rankings notably introduced new categories for Open Universities and Skill Universities, expanding the scope of its assessment.

5. **Aadharshila (National Curriculum for ECCE):** This curriculum is specifically designed for early childhood care and education (ECCE), catering to children aged 3-6 years.  Its structure is based on the Panchakosha concept, integrating various aspects of child development.


Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                        Specific Feature/Characteristic
1. UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Has 164 signatory members, including India.
2.  Biwako Millennium Framework                   : Works towards an inclusive, barrier-free society.
3.  National Research Foundation (NRF)           :  Established under the NEP.
4.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                 : Digitally stores academic credits earned from various institutions.
5.  National Educational Technology Forum (NETF) : A platform for the exchange of ideas on technology in education.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Let's break down why:

1. **UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):** The UN-CRPD indeed has a significant number of signatory members, with India being among them.  The exact number might fluctuate slightly depending on the latest updates, but the statement accurately reflects its broad international participation.

2. **Biwako Millennium Framework:** This framework is correctly paired with its focus on creating inclusive and accessible societies, overcoming barriers for people with disabilities.

3. **National Research Foundation (NRF):** While the NRF is mentioned in relation to the National Education Policy (NEP),  it's not explicitly stated as being *established* under the NEP.  The NEP recommends its establishment, but the exact phrasing makes this a less certain match.

4. **Academic Bank of Credit (ABC):** The ABC system is accurately described as a digital platform for storing academic credits earned across different educational institutions.

5. **National Educational Technology Forum (NETF):** The NETF is correctly identified as a forum for sharing knowledge and ideas related to technology's application in education.


Option 3 correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs. Option 3 is the best answer because it accurately reflects the information provided.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the NRF pair, which lacks definitive confirmation of its establishment under the NEP. The other options are also incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.



**3. With reference to tribal communities in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Group                                     Characteristic/Location
1. Bru (Reang) tribe                               : Practices Jhum cultivation in hilly regions.
2.  Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes        :  Received Habitat Rights in Odisha.
3.  Denotified Tribes (DNTs)                       :  Were ‘notified’ as ‘born criminal’ during the British Raj.
4.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Identified based on criteria including forest-based livelihoods.
5.  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes              :  Categorized into hunter/trappers, pastoralists, and peripatetic groups.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The information accurately reflects the characteristics and circumstances of the various tribal groups mentioned:

1. **Bru (Reang) tribe:**  The description accurately highlights their practice of Jhum cultivation (slash-and-burn agriculture) in hilly areas.

2. **Juangs of Keonjhar and Mankidia tribes:** The receipt of Habitat Rights in Odisha for these tribes is correctly stated.

3. **Denotified Tribes (DNTs):**  The historical context of DNTs being labeled as "born criminals" during British rule is accurate, reflecting their unjust and discriminatory treatment.

4. **Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs):** The criteria used for identifying PVTGs, which includes dependence on forest-based livelihoods, is correctly described.

5. **Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes:** The categorization of these tribes into hunter-gatherers, pastoralists, and peripatetic groups accurately reflects their diverse livelihood strategies and mobility patterns.


Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, as all five pairs are accurately matched.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  The question tests factual knowledge about different tribal groups in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Implementation Detail
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Funds allocated under the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) for 10 years
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF)          :  Mobilisation of ₹1,00,000 crore for the period 2023-2028
3.  National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) :  Covers children aged 3 to 8 years
4.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education  :  Aims to integrate informal learning into formal education through assessments and certifications.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, for its funding.  The tenure is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10 years, making statement 1 incorrect. The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) aims to mobilize ₹50,000 crore (₹14,000 crore from the Centre and ₹36,000 crore from private sources) for the period 2023-2028, not ₹1,00,000 crore, rendering statement 2 incorrect.  The National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), Aadharshila, is specifically designed for children aged 3 to 6 years, not 3 to 8, thus making statement 3 incorrect.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) indeed aims to formally assess existing knowledge, skills, and experience gained through various learning pathways and integrate them into the formal education system, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                           State/Region of Presence
1. Paudi Bhuyans                                  :   Madhya Pradesh
2.  Bharias                                         :    Chhattisgarh
3.  Kamars                                          :    Odisha
4. Dongria Kondhs                                  :    Odisha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Paudi Bhuyans are a tribal group primarily residing in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Bharias are found in Madhya Pradesh, not Chhattisgarh, thus making statement 2 incorrect. The Kamars are indeed a tribal community found in Chhattisgarh, making statement 3 correct. The Dongria Kondhs are also correctly matched with Odisha, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                              Description
1.  'Habitat' as defined by FRA                       :  Areas comprising customary habitat in reserved and protected forests of only primitive tribal groups
2. Habitat Rights                                     :  Accorded after consultation solely with the tribal community concerned
3. PVTGs (Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups)       :  Identified based on criteria that include a rapidly growing population
4.  Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans           :  Formulated at the national level for all PVTGs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FRA's definition of 'habitat' includes customary habitats and other habitats in reserved and protected forests for various forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs), not just primitive tribal groups, making statement 1 incorrect.  The process of granting Habitat Rights involves consultation with multiple stakeholders, not just the tribal community, rendering statement 2 incorrect.  PVTGs are identified based on criteria including a stagnant or declining population, among other factors, making statement 3 incorrect.  CCD plans are formulated at the micro-level (district or state), not nationally, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Term/Concept                                     Description/Feature
1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         :   Repealed in 1952
2.  Vimukta Jatis Day                                :   Celebrated on August 30th
3.  Habitual Offenders Act                          :   Recommended for immediate repeal by the Renke Commission (2008)
4.  Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Supreme Court Case  :   Upheld the constitutionality of caste-based discrimination in prisons.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, was repealed in 1949, not 1952, making statement 1 partially correct.  Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st, not August 30th, making statement 2 incorrect. The Idate Commission (2017), not the Renke Commission (2008), recommended the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act, making statement 3 partially correct.  The Sukanya Santha case struck down provisions allowing caste-based discrimination in prisons, not upholding it, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are partially correct, though the dates are slightly off, making (a) the closest answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Higher Education Initiative/Ranking                  Characteristic
1. QS World University Rankings, 2025                 :  Based on 10 performance indicators
2.  University Impact Rankings 2024                    :  Top-ranked Indian University is IIT Bombay
3. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Allows only foreign universities ranked in the global top 200 to establish campuses in India.
4. National Education Policy (NEP) 2020              : Introduced a 5-year undergraduate degree structure with multiple exit options.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) None
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings are based on 9, not 10, performance indicators, making statement 1 incorrect. The University Impact Rankings 2024 ranked Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, not IIT Bombay, as the top Indian university, making statement 2 incorrect. The UGC regulations allow foreign universities ranked in the global top 500, not top 200, to set up campuses in India, making statement 3 incorrect.  NEP 2020 introduced multiple exit options within a 3 or 4-year undergraduate structure, not a 5-year structure, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Related Detail
1.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) :  Established under the ANRF Act 2023
2.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  Covers around 63,000 villages
3.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024          : Published by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
4.  World Health Assembly (WHA)             :  Comprises all 194 WHO Member States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) was indeed established under the ANRF Act 2023, signifying a significant restructuring of India's research landscape.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities across approximately 63,000 villages, reflecting a large-scale developmental initiative. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is a collaborative effort between Concern Worldwide (Ireland) and Welthungerhilfe (Germany), highlighting international cooperation in addressing global food security challenges. Finally, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), includes representation from all 194 WHO Member States, emphasizing its global reach and influence on international health policies.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                    Key Feature/Objective
1.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme : 100% Central assistance
2.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     : Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right
3.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006               : Defines 'habitat' for PVTGs
4.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana       : Provides Rs 5000/- on the birth of the first child


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme is indeed a centrally sponsored scheme with 100% central assistance. The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a statutory right in India. The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), explicitly defines the concept of 'habitat' in relation to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) and other forest-dwelling communities. The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) provides financial assistance of Rs 5000 to registered pregnant women and lactating mothers for the birth of their first child. Thus, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                  Core Element/Provision
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD): Adopted in New York in 2006
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :  Defines Pandemic emergency
3.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                   :  Repealed in 1949
4.  Habitual Offenders Act                      :  Recommended for repeal by Idate Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was indeed adopted in New York in 2006. The amended International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, now include a definition of a pandemic emergency. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory piece of legislation, was repealed in 1949. Finally, the Idate Commission recommended the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act, highlighting its potential for misuse and discriminatory practices.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, leaving out correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                     Key Finding/Characteristic
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                : India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : Released by five UN agencies
3.  Annual Survey of Industries (ASI)             : Covers factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948
4.  Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI)           : Released by the Reserve Bank of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the pairs are correctly matched. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report correctly places India's rank at 105 out of 127 countries. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, is indeed a collaborative effort published by five UN agencies.  The Annual Survey of Industries (ASI) does cover factories registered under the Factories Act, 1948. However, the statement that the Index of Eight Core Industries (ICI) is released by the Reserve Bank of India is incorrect; it's actually released by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.  Therefore, only options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                              Implementing Ministry/Agency
1.  Aadharshila (National Curriculum for ECCE) : Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)
2.  PM-JUGA                                     : 17 line ministries
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan                             :  Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD)
4.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                    : Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Aadharshila, the national curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), falls under the purview of the Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD). PM-JUGA, a multi-faceted initiative, involves the convergence of efforts from 17 line ministries. The POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) is also a flagship program of the MoWCD. Finally, PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), the rural housing scheme, is implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Ministry/Scheme                                     Objective/Component
1. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                         :   Skill development and entrepreneurship promotion
2. Jal Jeevan Mission                               :   Providing pucca houses for eligible households
3. Skill India Mission                               :   Ensuring all-weather road connectivity to ST villages
4. PM Gram Sadak Yojana                            :   Providing access to training for tribal youth

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by converging various schemes.  Option (c) correctly identifies two such linkages.  The Jal Jeevan Mission aims to provide every rural household with a functional household tap connection, aligning with PM-JUGA's goal of providing basic amenities. Similarly, PM Gram Sadak Yojana focuses on providing all-weather road connectivity to villages, directly contributing to improved infrastructure under PM-JUGA.  Option (a) is incorrect because skill development falls under the Skill India Mission and other livelihood initiatives, not PM Awas Yojana. Option (b) is partially correct, but incomplete. Option (d) incorrectly links Skill India Mission with road connectivity, which is the purview of PM Gram Sadak Yojana.  The accurate matching of ministries and their roles within PM-JUGA demonstrates a crucial understanding of government schemes and their inter-linkages, a key aspect of UPSC preparation.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Role/Focus
1. UNEP                                             :   Reducing food losses along production and supply chains
2. WRAP                                             :   Tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels
3. FAO                                              :   Halving per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024, released by UNEP and WRAP, focuses on measuring global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.  UNEP's role is primarily in tracking and reporting this waste, aligning with option (c). WRAP, a UK-based charity, collaborated with UNEP in producing the report, further supporting the accuracy of this pairing. The FAO, while involved in broader food security issues, is specifically the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), which focuses on reducing food losses during production and supply chains, not the retail and consumer levels addressed by the FWI report.  Therefore, option (d) is incorrect. Option (a) and (b) are incomplete and fail to capture the collaborative nature of the report's creation and the distinct focuses of the different organizations involved.  Understanding the roles of different international organizations in tackling global issues like food waste is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**3. With reference to the National Health Accounts Estimates for India, consider the following pairs:**

   Health Expenditure Category                       Percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) in 2021-22
1. Government Health Expenditure (GHE)              :   87.3%
2. Current Health Expenditure (CHE)                 :   48%
3. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE)               :   39.4%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Health Accounts Estimates provide a detailed breakdown of health expenditure in India. Option (c) correctly identifies the percentage of Out-of-Pocket Expenditures (OOPE) as 39.4% of the Total Health Expenditure (THE) in 2021-22.  The other options are incorrect. GHE constituted 48% of THE, not 87.3% as stated in option (a). CHE, representing recurrent expenditures, formed 87.3% of THE, contradicting option (b).  Understanding the composition of health expenditure, including the significant share of out-of-pocket spending, is vital for analyzing India's healthcare system and formulating effective policies. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall and accurately interpret numerical data from official reports, a frequently tested skill in the UPSC exam.


**4. With reference to the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA), consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                              State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                                    :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Juangs                                           :   Odisha
3. Bharias                                          :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                                       :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, recognizes the rights of various tribal communities. Option (c) correctly identifies two such tribes and their respective states. The Juangs are indeed a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) residing in Odisha, and the Maria Gond tribe is found in Maharashtra. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings. The Paudi Bhuyans are primarily found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, and the Bharias are a tribal group in Madhya Pradesh, not Chhattisgarh.  The question tests knowledge of specific tribal groups and their geographical distribution, which is an important aspect of understanding India's diverse population and the implementation of welfare schemes targeted at specific communities.  This is a challenging question because it requires precise knowledge of tribal demographics across multiple states.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                           Value/Status in India
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) score                   :   18.3
2. Percentage of population undernourished        :   13.7%
3. Percentage of children under five experiencing stunting:    18.7%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report provides data on hunger levels globally and in individual countries. Option (b) accurately reflects the finding that 13.7% of India's population suffers from undernourishment.  Option (a) is incorrect; the global GHI score is 18.3, not India's.  Option (c) presents an inaccurate figure for child stunting; the correct figure is higher than 35.5%.  The question assesses understanding of GHI data interpretation and the ability to differentiate between global and national-level statistics, a crucial skill for analyzing development indicators in the UPSC context.  The close proximity of the incorrect options to the correct data makes this question challenging and tests the candidate's precise recall and analytical ability.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Mission                                   Key Feature/Implementation Detail
1. PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) :  Focuses solely on the development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
2.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme :  Employs a micro-plan approach through Conservation cum Development (CCD) plans.
3.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                       :  Provides pucca houses for eligible tribal households under PM-JUGA.
4.  National Health Mission                           :  Includes coverage of immunization through Mobile Medical Units in remote areas as part of PM-JUGA.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the schemes and missions mentioned.  The PVTG scheme indeed uses CCD plans for a micro-plan approach to development. PM Awaas Yojana is a key component in providing housing under PM-JUGA's goal of providing pucca houses along with other entitlements. The National Health Mission is integral to PM-JUGA’s aim to improve healthcare access, as evidenced by the inclusion of mobile medical units for immunization in remote areas.

Option (a) is incorrect because PM-JUGA is a broader initiative encompassing various tribal communities, not limited to PVTGs alone, although PVTGs are certainly a significant focus. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the accurate pairing of the National Health Mission with PM-JUGA. Option (c) is also partially correct but excludes the accurate pairing of the PVTG scheme with its implementation detail.  Therefore, only option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the interrelationship between different government schemes targeting tribal welfare.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                           State/Region
1. Paudi Bhuyans                                  :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                         :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                          :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                                      :   Maharashtra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct as it identifies the correct states for the Kamars (Chhattisgarh) and Maria Gond (Maharashtra) tribal communities.  The other options incorrectly assign these groups to different states. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups across India, demanding factual recall and regional awareness.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Characteristic
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research) :  Focuses solely on established institutions.
2.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas)   :  Supports basic research in humanities.
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)                :  Receives no funding from private sources.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. PAIR involves pairing established institutions with those at a nascent stage for mentorship. MAHA targets solution-focused research in priority areas, not basic humanities research. ACEs receive substantial funding, including private contributions.  The question assesses understanding of the ANRF's initiatives and their operational characteristics, requiring a detailed understanding of the program's goals.  The option (d) tests the candidate's ability to identify inaccuracies and evaluate the information critically.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Provision/Feature
1. Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                     :  Defines ‘habitat’ exclusively for pre-agricultural communities.
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                        :  Was repealed due to its discriminatory nature against Denotified Tribes.
3.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Grants habitat rights only after extensive consultation with PVTGs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The FRA 2006 does define 'habitat', but not exclusively for pre-agricultural communities; it includes other forest-dwelling STs as well.  The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 was indeed repealed because of its discriminatory nature. The FRA 2006 does mandate consultation before granting habitat rights, but not exclusively with PVTGs.  The question tests factual recall of legislation related to tribal rights and their key features.  The inclusion of partially correct statements as distractors makes the question challenging.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                            Finding/Observation
1. Global GHI score                                   :  Indicates extremely high levels of hunger globally.
2. India's GHI rank                                    :  Improved significantly compared to 2023.
3.  India's child wasting and stunting rates          :  Have decreased substantially.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The global GHI score in 2024 was classified as moderate, not extremely high.  While India's rank improved, child wasting and stunting rates remained high.  The question requires the ability to interpret data presented in the GHI report and distinguish between factual accuracy and misleading interpretations.  The inclusion of plausible but inaccurate statements highlights the need for precise understanding of the report's findings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index                                      Organization/Body
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024          :  World Food Programme
2. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) 2024    :  United Nations Development Programme
3. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022      :  World Economic Forum
4. Food Waste Index Report 2024            : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 was released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Food Programme.  The World Food Programme is involved in addressing food security issues globally, but it is not the releasing body for the GHI. The Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) 2024 is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP. UNDP releases the Gender Inequality Index (GII).  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 was indeed released by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly associate the indices with the wrong organizations, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in understanding global development indicators.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between various international indices and their respective publishers, a crucial aspect of understanding global development and policy.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                        Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024             :  India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024              : India ranked 5th in South Asia
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition Report 2024 : Focuses on financing to end hunger
4. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)       : Released by Food Security Information Network (FSIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The GHI 2024 did indeed rank India 105th out of 127 countries. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly places India 5th in South Asia. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses precisely on financing to end hunger and malnutrition. Finally, the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN).  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of key reports related to global food security, nutrition, and gender equality, requiring factual recall and the ability to connect reports with their core findings and publishing bodies. The inclusion of multiple correct pairs makes simple guessing less likely, demanding a thorough understanding of the subject matter.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                             Description/Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provided Rs 5000 to registered women
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana           : Provided free food grains to 80 crore poor
3. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0             : Bridges the gap between RDA and ADI
4. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013       : Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 aim to bridge the gap between Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and Average Daily Intake (ADI). The National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013 does indeed recognize the right to food as a statutory right. However, PMGKAY provided free food grains to 80 crore poor, not financial assistance to women.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY) offered financial assistance (Rs 5000) to registered pregnant and lactating women, not free food grains. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian government schemes related to food security and nutrition, requiring the ability to distinguish between the objectives and features of similar-sounding programs. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as switching the descriptions of PMGKAY and PMMVY, increases the difficulty level and emphasizes the need for precise knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking/Index                                  Top-Ranked Indian Institution (2024/2025)

2. QS World University Rankings 2025            : IIT Bombay
3. World University Rankings 2025              : Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
4. University Impact Rankings 2024             : IIT Madras


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  In the QS World University Rankings 2025, IIT Bombay was the top-ranked Indian institution.  The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, was the top-ranked Indian university in the World University Rankings 2025.  However, IIT Madras topped the Overall category in the NIRF 2024 rankings, not IISc Bangalore.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was the top-ranked Indian University in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not IIT Madras. The question tests the candidate's awareness of various Indian institutions' performance in global and national university rankings, requiring the ability to recall specific ranking details.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as mixing up top-ranked institutions across different rankings, increases the difficulty level and necessitates precise knowledge of the subject.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Total Health Expenditure (THE) as % of GDP : Decreased
2. THE per capita                                  : Increased
3. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as % of THE : Decreased
4. Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as % of THE : Increased

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  THE per capita did increase from Rs. 4,297 to Rs. 6,602.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP increased, not decreased. Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE also increased, not decreased.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditures on Healthcare (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased, not increased.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of trends in India's healthcare financing, demanding precise recall of numerical data and trends.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as reversing the trends for some indicators, necessitates a thorough understanding of the data and enhances the difficulty level.  This question also tests the ability to interpret data presented in percentage changes.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005                                  Specific Feature

2.  Creation of National IHR Authorities                                                            Enhanced global health surveillance
3.  Defining pandemic emergency as communicable disease with wide geographical spread           Facilitating financial assistance to developing nations
4.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism                                                Strengthening national health systems


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005, adopted at the 77th World Health Assembly, aimed to improve global preparedness and response to public health emergencies.  Option (c) correctly identifies three key features.  The establishment of a States Parties Committee is crucial for effective IHR implementation and oversight, ensuring countries adhere to the regulations. Similarly, the creation of National IHR Authorities enhances coordination within each country, streamlining responses to outbreaks.  The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism is designed to address the resource disparities between developed and developing nations, providing much-needed support for effective pandemic management.

Option (d) is incorrect because while the definition of a pandemic emergency as a communicable disease with wide geographical spread is part of the amendments, its primary purpose isn't facilitating financial assistance.  Financial assistance is addressed through the Coordinating Financial Mechanism. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.  The amendments were comprehensive, addressing multiple aspects of pandemic preparedness, response, and international collaboration.  Understanding these different aspects is essential for a comprehensive understanding of global health governance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                                                  Key Provision
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005                        Defines domestic violence to include emotional abuse.
2.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013  Establishes Local Complaints Committees (LCCs) at the district level.
3.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971                                    Allows abortion beyond 24 weeks in specific cases.
4.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016                                        Mandates the establishment of State Commissioners for Disabilities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) accurately reflects the key provisions of three of the listed acts. The PWDVA, 2005, comprehensively defines domestic violence, encompassing physical, sexual, verbal, emotional, and economic abuse. The POSH Act, 2013, establishes both Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) within organizations and LCCs at the district level to handle complaints, particularly from the unorganized sector. The RPwD Act, 2016, significantly strengthens the rights and protections of persons with disabilities by mandating the creation of State Commissioners for Disabilities to oversee implementation and address violations.


Option (d) is incorrect because the MTP Act, 1971, in its original form, did not allow abortion beyond 24 weeks.  The 2021 amendment introduced this provision under specific circumstances. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.  These acts highlight India's legislative efforts to address critical social issues related to women's rights, workplace safety, and disability rights.  Understanding the key provisions of each is crucial for analyzing the effectiveness of these laws in achieving their intended objectives and identifying areas for potential improvement.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

1.  Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others                                      Struck down caste-based discrimination in prisons.
2.  Hiral P Harsora and ors Vs Kusum Narottamdas Harsora & Ors         Struck down the words "adult male" in the Domestic Violence Act.
3.  Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr                                  Established guidelines for passive euthanasia.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  The *Sukanya Santha* case dealt with the unconstitutionality of caste-based discrimination within prisons, highlighting the violation of fundamental rights.  The *Hiral P Harsora* case broadened the scope of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act by removing the gender-specific limitation of "adult male," ensuring greater protection for women regardless of the perpetrator's gender. The *Common Cause* case provided crucial guidelines on passive euthanasia, addressing the right to die with dignity for terminally ill patients.

There are no incorrect pairings in this question.  These cases demonstrate the Supreme Court's role in shaping social justice and legal interpretations in India. Understanding these landmark judgments is vital for comprehending the evolution of legal frameworks concerning marginalized communities, women's rights, and end-of-life care.  The consistent accuracy of the pairings emphasizes the importance of judicial activism in addressing pressing social issues.

2.  Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality                   Promoting women's health, education, and enterprise globally.
3.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan)                    Improving accessibility for persons with disabilities.
4.  Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)                        Providing rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA aims to uplift tribal communities through improved infrastructure, healthcare, education, and livelihood opportunities. The "Alliance for Global Good" is a collaborative initiative focused on advancing gender equality and empowering women across various sectors. The Accessible India Campaign aims to create a more inclusive environment for persons with disabilities, improving accessibility in infrastructure and services.  The DDRS provides comprehensive rehabilitation services for persons with disabilities, promoting their independence and integration into society.

The comprehensive accuracy of the pairs highlights the multifaceted approach taken by the Indian government and international collaborations to address social development and inclusion.  Understanding these initiatives is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of government policies and their impact on various marginalized sections of society.  The question tests knowledge of various schemes and their objectives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Scheme                                  Key Feature/Provision
1. RPwD Act, 2016                           :   Provides 4% reservation in government jobs for PwDs
2. National Policy for PwDs, 2006          :   Established the Rehabilitation Council of India
3. Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) :  Focuses on skill training for PwDs
4. Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)  :  Incentivizes private sector employers to hire PwDs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The RPwD Act, 2016, indeed mandates 4% reservation in government jobs for persons with benchmark disabilities.  This is a cornerstone provision of the act aimed at promoting inclusive employment. Options 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. While the National Policy for PwDs, 2006, aimed to improve the lives of PwDs, the Rehabilitation Council of India was established earlier under the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992.  The Accessible India Campaign focuses on making infrastructure accessible, not primarily on skill training, although skill development is a related aspect.  DDRS aims at rehabilitation and empowerment of PwDs, not incentivizing private sector hiring, though government incentives for private sector employment of PwDs are mentioned in related policy documents but not directly as a feature of DDRS. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, playing on the interconnectedness of various schemes and policies related to disability rights in India.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

Feature                                     Detail
1. Year of Adoption                          :   2008
2. Number of Signatories (including India)  :   194
3. Objective                                 :   To ensure full and equal enjoyment of human rights by all persons with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD's primary objective is accurately stated in pair 3: to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the convention was adopted in 2006, and entered into force in 2008. Pair 2 is also incorrect; while India is a signatory, the total number of signatories is 164, not 194. The incorrect data in pairs 1 and 2 serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the convention's details.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related but ultimately incorrect information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Act/Legislation                                  Specific Provision/Focus
1.  The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:  Habitat rights for PVTGs
2.  Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 (PCMA) :   Appointment of Child Marriage Prevention Officers (CMPOs)
3.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                 :   Categorization of certain communities as "born criminals"
4.  Habitual Offenders Act (State-level)        :    Recommended for immediate repeal by the Idate Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly includes habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs). The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, indeed involves the establishment of Child Marriage Prevention Officers. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, notoriously categorized certain communities as "born criminals," leading to significant social injustice. Finally, the Idate Commission did recommend the immediate repeal of state-level Habitual Offenders Acts due to their potential for misuse and harassment of marginalized communities. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various acts and their key provisions, requiring a broad understanding of social legislation in India.  The lack of incorrect options makes this a difficult question, demanding comprehensive recall.


**4. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

Feature/Initiative                                      Specific Aspect
1.  Birsa Munda                                        :   Inspiration for the scheme's name
2.  PM-JANMAN                                          :   Source of learnings and success for PM-JUGA
3.  Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) :   Primary funding source
4. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)     :   Aims to promote tribal home stays


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The PM-JUGA scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a prominent tribal leader.  The scheme has explicitly drawn learnings and experiences from the PM-JANMAN initiative.  DAPST grants are the primary funding source for PM-JUGA. However, pair 4 is incorrect; while TMMCs are a part of PM-JUGA, their primary aim is to improve market access for tribal producers, not to promote tribal homestays (that is a separate initiative under Swadesh Darshan). This question assesses the candidate's understanding of a specific government scheme and its key features, requiring detailed knowledge of its implementation and funding mechanisms. The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect distractor increases the question's difficulty.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Amendment to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005          Specific Change
1.  Pandemic Emergency Definition                  :   Inclusion of a States Parties Committee
2.  Coordinating Financial Mechanism                :   Addresses needs of developing countries
3.  Establishment of National IHR Authorities       :   Improved coordination among countries
4.  Processing Time Extension for Applications       :   Extended from one month to three months


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, did indeed establish a coordinating financial mechanism to support developing countries, create national IHR authorities to improve coordination, and extend the processing time for applications.  However, pair 1 is incorrect.  The definition of a pandemic emergency was revised to include aspects like "wide geographical spread" and exceeding the capacity of national health systems, not the creation of a States Parties Committee (that was a separate amendment). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international health regulations and their recent amendments, requiring an understanding of global health governance and response mechanisms.  The incorrect option serves as a strong distractor.


**6. With reference to the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education, consider the following pairs:**

Aspect                                        Detail/Feature
1.  Mechanism                                   :   Evaluates existing knowledge, skills, and experience
2.  Purpose                                     :   Integrates informal learning into the formal system
3.  Year of NEP Implementation in Higher Ed    :   2021
4.  Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) in 2021-22   :   23.7%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. RPL is a formal mechanism to evaluate prior learning, and its purpose is to integrate non-formal and informal learning into formal education.  However, pairs 3 and 4 are incorrect.  While NEP 2020 envisions RPL, its implementation began later. The GER in 2021-22 was 28.4%, not 23.7%. These incorrect figures act as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of higher education statistics and policy implementation timelines.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of educational policy implementation.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe Related Entity/Fact
1.  Renke Commission (2008)                :   Estimated 198 Denotified Tribes
2.  Idate Commission (2017)                 :   Recommended repealing Habitual Offenders Acts
3.  Vimukta Jatis Day                         :   Celebrated on August 31st
4.  Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Case    :   Upheld caste-based discrimination in prisons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Renke Commission did estimate the number of Denotified Tribes. The Idate Commission recommended repealing the Habitual Offenders Acts. Vimukta Jatis Day is indeed celebrated on August 31st.  However, pair 4 is incorrect; the Sukanya Santha case actually struck *down* caste-based discrimination in prisons.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of reports, commissions, and legal cases related to nomadic and denotified tribes, requiring an understanding of social justice issues and legal precedents.  The inclusion of a contradictory distractor makes the question more challenging.


**8. With reference to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in India, consider the following pairs:**

Entity/Scheme                                 Detail/Feature
1.  Aadharshila                               :   National Curriculum for children aged 3-6
2.  Ministry of Women and Child Development (MoWCD) :   Launched Aadharshila
3.  Anganwadis                               :   Intended setting for Aadharshila implementation
4.  Age-Appropriate Screening Tool              :   Excludes children with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Aadharshila is indeed a national curriculum for children aged 3-6, launched by the MoWCD, and intended for implementation in anganwadis.  However, pair 4 is incorrect; the Aadharshila curriculum specifically includes an age-appropriate screening tool to facilitate the inclusion of children with disabilities. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of early childhood education policies and programs in India, requiring familiarity with specific schemes and their implementation details. The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but ultimately incorrect option increases the question's difficulty.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                      Ranking Category
1. IIT Madras                     : Overall Category
2. IISC Bangalore                 :  Universities Category
3. Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham    :  University Impact Rankings
4. Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) : QS World University Rankings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided pairs correctly match institutions with their respective ranking categories.  IIT Madras consistently topped the overall category in NIRF rankings, while IISC Bangalore held the top position in the Universities category for several consecutive years.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham achieved a high rank in the Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings, which assess universities based on their contribution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Finally, IIT Bombay secured a top ranking among Indian institutions in the QS World University Rankings.  All these facts are verifiable and publicly available through the official websites of the ranking organizations and the institutions themselves. There is no ambiguity or room for misinterpretation in these pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Organization             Key Feature
1. Times Higher Education (THE)    :  Includes 18 indicators across five key areas in their World University Rankings
2. Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)      :  Published University Impact Rankings
3. National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) : Uses five parameters: Teaching, Learning and Resources; Research and Professional Practices; Graduation Outcomes; Outreach and Inclusivity; and Perception.
4.  Ministry of Education          : Released the India Rankings 2024.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Times Higher Education (THE) indeed uses 18 indicators across five key areas for its World University Rankings.  The NIRF framework, implemented by the Ministry of Education, uses the five parameters listed in the question. The Ministry of Education released the India Rankings 2024.  However, the QS ranking organization is not associated with University Impact Rankings; that is published by THE. Therefore, option (d) is incorrect. Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings based on the provided information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation/Framework          Main Purpose
1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :  Defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health events and emergencies.
2.  National Health Accounts Estimates : Offers a detailed description of the financial flows within India’s health system.
3. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act): To prevent and address incidents of sexual harassment of women at their workplace.
4.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023: To facilitate the entry of higher-ranked Foreign Universities into India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately describes the primary purpose of the respective act, regulation, or framework. The IHR, 2005, is a legally binding international framework for managing cross-border public health crises. The National Health Accounts Estimates provide a comprehensive financial overview of India's healthcare system. The POSH Act specifically addresses sexual harassment in the workplace. Lastly, the UGC regulations aim to enable foreign universities to establish campuses in India.  All four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Key Feature
1.  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) Report:  Ranked India 108th out of 193 countries in 2022.
2. Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF): Mobilisation of ₹50,000 crore for the period 2023-2028.
3. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA): Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.
4. Alliance for Global Good: Gender Equity and Equality:  Launched in Davos 2024.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly link the scheme/initiative with its key feature. NFHS-5 indeed provided a ranking for India in 2022.  ANRF secured significant funding for research and innovation. PM-JUGA focuses on tribal community upliftment.  The Alliance for Global Good was launched as stated.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.  The information presented in each pair is factual and verifiable.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Committee                 Responsibility/Function
1. National Board of Accreditation (NBA):  Assesses qualitative competence of programs offered by educational institutions.
2. INFLIBNET Centre                     : Collaborates with NBA in implementing NIRF.
3. States Parties Committee              : For effective IHR implementation.
4.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) : Handles complaints of sexual harassment under POSH Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the responsibilities or functions of the given organizations and committees.  The NBA assesses the quality of educational programs. INFLIBNET collaborates with NBA on the NIRF. The States Parties Committee is crucial for implementing the IHR.  The ICC handles sexual harassment complaints under the POSH Act.  Hence, option (d) encompassing all correctly matched pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  The information provided in each pair is precise and verifiable.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                      State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                            :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                   :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                    :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                               :   Maharashtra
5. Dongria Kondhs                           :   Chhattisgarh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 3 and 4 only.  The question tests knowledge of the geographical distribution of various tribal groups in India.  Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Paudi Bhuyans - Madhya Pradesh:** This is incorrect. The Paudi Bhuyans are a tribal group primarily residing in Odisha.

2. **Bharias - Odisha:** This is incorrect. The Bharias are primarily found in Madhya Pradesh.

3. **Kamars - Chhattisgarh:** This is correct. The Kamars are a tribal group found in Chhattisgarh.

4. **Maria Gond - Maharashtra:** This is correct. The Maria Gond tribe is predominantly located in Maharashtra.

5. **Dongria Kondhs - Chhattisgarh:** This is incorrect. The Dongria Kondhs are a tribal group primarily residing in Odisha.


The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (a) is wrong because of the incorrect pairing of Paudi Bhuyans. Option (c) is wrong because of the incorrect pairing of Bharias and Dongria Kondhs. Option (d) is wrong because it includes the incorrect pairing of Dongria Kondhs.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific facts about tribal groups and their distribution across Indian states, demanding precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs          Description
1.  Forest-based livelihoods              :   A predominantly agricultural economy
2.  Pre-agricultural level of existence     :   Reliance on hunting and gathering
3.  Stagnant and declining population     :   High population growth rates
4.  Extremely low literacy                 :   High literacy rates among PVTGs
5.  Subsistence economy                    :   A thriving and diverse economy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) 2 and 3 only.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the criteria used to identify PVTGs in India.

1. **Forest-based livelihoods - A predominantly agricultural economy:** This is incorrect.  PVTGs are characterized by forest-based livelihoods, not agricultural ones.  The statement reverses the actual characteristic.

2. **Pre-agricultural level of existence - Reliance on hunting and gathering:** This is correct.  Many PVTGs still rely on traditional practices like hunting and gathering for sustenance.

3. **Stagnant and declining population - High population growth rates:** This is correct.  One of the key characteristics of PVTGs is a stagnant or declining population, contrasting with high growth rates in other groups.

4. **Extremely low literacy - High literacy rates among PVTGs:** This is incorrect.  Low literacy rates are a defining feature of PVTGs.

5. **Subsistence economy - A thriving and diverse economy:** This is incorrect. A subsistence economy, where people produce just enough to meet their own needs, is a characteristic of PVTGs.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of pairs related to the criteria for identifying PVTGs.  The question demands precise knowledge of the socio-economic characteristics used to define PVTGs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                  Key Feature
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006             :   Excludes PVTGs from habitat rights
2.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                 :   Repealed in 1952
3.  Development of PVTGs Scheme             :   100% state funding
4.  PM-JUGA                                    :   Focuses solely on infrastructure development
5.  Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Case    :   Upheld caste-based discrimination in prisons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. This question tests understanding of various legislations and schemes related to tribal welfare and their key features.

1. **Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006 - Excludes PVTGs from habitat rights:** Incorrect. The FRA explicitly includes provisions for granting habitat rights to PVTGs.

2. **Criminal Tribes Act, 1871 - Repealed in 1952:** Correct. This Act, which categorized certain communities as "criminal tribes," was repealed, and these communities were denotified.

3. **Development of PVTGs Scheme - 100% state funding:** Incorrect.  The scheme is centrally sponsored with 100% central assistance.

4. **PM-JUGA - Focuses solely on infrastructure development:** Incorrect. PM-JUGA has a broader focus encompassing social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.

5. **Sukanya Santha vs. UoI & Others Case - Upheld caste-based discrimination in prisons:** Incorrect.  The Supreme Court struck down caste-based discrimination in prisons in this case.


Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Only pair 2 is correctly matched, highlighting the repeal of the Criminal Tribes Act. The question necessitates precise knowledge of the legal and policy landscape concerning tribal communities in India.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI), consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                  Value/Characteristic in India (2024)
1.  Overall GHI Score                       :   Below "serious" category
2.  Undernourishment Prevalence           :   Less than 10%
3.  Child wasting prevalence (under-five)   :   Below 15%
4.  Child stunting prevalence (under-five)  :   Below 30%
5.  India's GHI Rank (out of 127 countries) :   Above 110th


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 5 only. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key findings of the Global Hunger Index (GHI) report for India in 2024.

1. **Overall GHI Score - Below "serious" category:** Incorrect. India's GHI score falls under the "serious" category.

2. **Undernourishment Prevalence - Less than 10%:** Incorrect. The undernourishment prevalence is higher than 10%.

3. **Child wasting prevalence (under-five) - Below 15%:** Incorrect. Child wasting prevalence is above 15%.

4. **Child stunting prevalence (under-five) - Below 30%:** Incorrect. Child stunting prevalence is above 30%.

5. **India's GHI Rank (out of 127 countries) - Above 110th:** Correct. India's rank is 105th, which is above 110th.

All options except (b) include at least one mismatched pair. Option (b) correctly identifies that India's rank was indeed above 110th.  The question highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of hunger indicators and their interpretation in the context of a global report.  The high number of incorrect pairs makes this a challenging question for candidates lacking precise knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative     Focus Area
1.  GNAFC                                  :   Addressing the root causes of food surpluses
2.  Food Waste Index Report (FWI)          :   Tracking food waste at the producer level
3.  GAIN                                   :   Promoting investments in nutritious foods
4.  UN-CRPD                                :   Focuses primarily on education for disabled
5.  WHO                                    :   Solely responsible for tackling malnutrition globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Only three. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and initiatives related to food security, nutrition, and disability rights.

1. **GNAFC - Addressing the root causes of food surpluses:** Incorrect. GNAFC focuses on addressing the root causes of food crises, not surpluses.

2. **Food Waste Index Report (FWI) - Tracking food waste at the producer level:** Incorrect. While FWI tracks food waste, its main focus is on retail and consumer levels.

3. **GAIN - Promoting investments in nutritious foods:** Correct. GAIN's primary goal is to promote nutrition investments in agri-food systems.

4. **UN-CRPD - Focuses primarily on education for disabled:** Incorrect. UN-CRPD has a broader focus on the rights and inclusion of persons with disabilities, not solely education.

5. **WHO - Solely responsible for tackling malnutrition globally:** Incorrect. While WHO plays a significant role, it doesn't bear sole responsibility for tackling malnutrition globally; it collaborates with other organizations.


Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the focus areas of the listed organizations and initiatives. The question assesses the candidate's ability to associate organizations with their core mandates and avoid generalizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                  Organization/Agency
1. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)         :   World Food Programme (WFP)
2. Food Waste Index Report 2024              :   UN Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition Report :   International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)
4. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             :   United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), a partnership that includes the World Food Programme (WFP).  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is indeed launched by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 is jointly released by five UN agencies, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect because it omits the correct matching of the GRFC and the Food Waste Index Report. Option (a) is too narrow, and options (c) and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is published by the World Economic Forum (WEF), not the UNDP; hence, pair 4 is incorrect. This illustrates the importance of precise knowledge of organizations associated with specific reports and indices, a crucial aspect of UPSC preparation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                                 Implementing Agency/Ministry
1.  NQAS Assessment                               :   Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2.  PM Suryaghar Yojana                            :   Ministry of New and Renewable Energy
3.  Operation Ganga                                :   Ministry of External Affairs
4.  Project NAMAN                                  :   Indian Army


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment is indeed launched by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Project NAMAN, focused on providing support to defence pensioners and veterans, is an initiative of the Indian Army.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The PM Suryaghar Yojana, focusing on solar rooftop installations, falls under the ambit of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy, making pair 2 incorrect as stated.  Operation Ganga, the Indian government's effort to evacuate citizens from Ukraine, was primarily managed by the Ministry of External Affairs, making pair 3 incorrect as currently stated. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. The question tests the ability to associate government initiatives with their responsible ministries or agencies, a common theme in UPSC examinations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                    Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                :   Highest percentage of doping offenders in India
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                 :   India ranked 129th out of 146 countries
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                  :   Households wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022
4.  State of Food Security and Nutrition Report  :   The world is far off track to achieve SDG 2, Zero Hunger


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 did indeed find that households across all continents wasted over 1 billion meals a day in 2022.  The State of Food Security and Nutrition Report accurately highlights that the world is significantly behind in achieving SDG 2 (Zero Hunger). Thus, pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 focuses on hunger levels and doesn't directly address doping statistics; therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  While the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly notes India's ranking, the question mixes unrelated information.  Option (a) is incorrect due to the mismatched pair 1. Option (b) is incorrect due to the mismatched pair 2. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 2. This question tests the ability to link reports and indices with their specific findings, a crucial skill in analyzing data presented in UPSC-style questions.


**4. With reference to the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                          Detail
1. Headquarters Location                         :   Geneva, Switzerland
2.  Type of Organization                         :   Intergovernmental Organization
3.  Primary Focus                                 :   Reducing gender inequalities in the agri-food sector


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN's headquarters are indeed located in Geneva, Switzerland, making pair 1 correct.  GAIN's recent report, "The Case for Investment in Nutritious Foods Value Chains," emphasizes the role of nutrition investments in reducing gender inequalities within the agri-food sector, making pair 3 correct.  However, GAIN is a Swiss-based Non-Governmental Organization (NGO), not an intergovernmental organization; therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair 2. This question assesses the understanding of GAIN's nature, location, and objectives, demonstrating the importance of understanding the nuances of international organizations relevant to global development issues.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Provision/Feature
1.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013    :   Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right
2.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition              :   Focuses on eliminating doping in sports
3.  Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024  :   "Sports for Nation Building" vision


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, explicitly recognizes the right to food as a statutory right in India, making pair 1 correct. The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024, has the vision statement "Sports for Nation Building," making pair 3 correct.  The Rome Declaration on Nutrition, however, deals with nutrition and food security, not doping in sports; therefore, pair 2 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 2. This question tests knowledge of important Indian legislation and national policies related to food security and sports development, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of UPSC examinations.


**1. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 and the Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022, consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                                    Key Finding/Ranking
    1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             :   India ranked 128th among 146 countries
    2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022           :   Denmark ranked highest globally
    3. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             :   The Health and Survival gender gap closed by 95%
    4. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022           :   India's rank improved from 2021

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 indeed placed India at 129th out of 146 countries, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 correctly identifies Denmark as one of the top-ranking countries, making statement 2 correct.  The report also accurately states that the Health and Survival gender gap has closed by 96%, not 95%, slightly altering statement 3 to make it correct.  Finally, India's GII ranking did improve from 2021, but statement 4 is incorrect as it doesn't specify the exact improvement.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify minor discrepancies in data, which are crucial for UPSC-level analysis.  The distractors are plausible, requiring careful examination of the provided data.


**2. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024 and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Initiative                                 Key Aspect
    1. Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :   Tracks food waste at the production level only
    2. SDG 12.3.1 (b)                               :   Custodian is the Food and Agriculture Organization
    3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :   Households wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022
    4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment: Aims at instant issuance of food licenses


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 does not solely focus on production-level waste; it also tracks waste at retail and consumer levels, making statement 1 incorrect.  SDG 12.3.1 (b) is correctly linked to the UNEP as the custodian, not the Food and Agriculture Organization, making statement 2 incorrect. The report accurately highlights that households wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022, making statement 3 correct.  The NQAS assessment is linked to improving healthcare, not to the instant issuance of food licenses (that's the Spot Food License Initiative), making statement 4 incorrect. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific details within the reports, demanding precise knowledge and eliminating common misconceptions.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**3. With reference to the  Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 and related entities, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Regulation                                  Key Feature
    1. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005   :   Established in 1961
    2. World Health Assembly (WHA)                  :   Appoints the Director-General of the WHO
    3. Amendments to IHR, 2005                      :   Established a global fund for pandemic response
    4. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005   :   Successor to the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IHR, 2005, was not established in 1961; it's a successor to earlier regulations, making statement 1 incorrect. The WHA does indeed appoint the WHO Director-General, making statement 2 correct. While the amendments aimed to improve pandemic response, they established a coordinating financial mechanism, not a global fund, making statement 3 incorrect. The IHR, 2005, correctly replaced the International Sanitary Regulations of 1951, making statement 4 correct.  This question tests knowledge of international health regulations and the functions of global health organizations, requiring recall of specific details and understanding of the roles and responsibilities of key entities. The distractors are carefully constructed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the nuances within the IHR framework.


**4. With reference to Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) in India and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Policy                                   Key Feature
    1. Navchetana ECS Framework                     :   Focuses on children aged 3-6 years
    2. National ECCE Policy, 2013                   :   Mentions Article 45 of the Indian Constitution
    3. NCF-FS 2022                                  :   Provides guidelines for 0-3 years old children
    4. Article 45 of the Indian Constitution          :   Mandates pre-school education


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Navchetana framework focuses on children from birth to three years, making statement 1 incorrect. The National ECCE Policy, 2013, does indeed reference Article 45, which directs the state to provide for ECCE up to age six, making statement 2 correct. The NCF-FS 2022 provides guidelines for the 0-3 and 3-6 age groups, making statement 3 correct.  Article 45 directs the provision of ECCE, but doesn't mandate pre-school education specifically, making statement 4 incorrect.  This question assesses knowledge of Indian education policies and their constitutional basis, requiring precise understanding of the scope and content of various initiatives. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related policies and their provisions.


**5.  With reference to the Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) and related concepts, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Fund                                    Description
    1. Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF)           :   Addresses only health risks
    2.  Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2)       :   Focuses on eradicating hunger and malnutrition
    3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)          :   Produced annually by the World Food Programme
    4.  Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF)           :   A corpus fund for community-level interventions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The VRF addresses multiple vulnerabilities, including food insecurity and natural calamities, not just health risks, making statement 1 incorrect. SDG 2 accurately focuses on ending hunger and all forms of malnutrition, making statement 2 correct. The GRFC is produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), not solely the World Food Programme, making statement 3 incorrect. The VRF is indeed a corpus fund used for community-level interventions to address various vulnerabilities, making statement 4 correct.  This question tests understanding of development-related concepts and the specifics of funding mechanisms. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar concepts and the precise roles of different organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Objective
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities over 5 years (2024-29)
2.  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) :  Focuses on enabling three crore Lakhpati Didis (women with annual household income of ₹1 lakh or more)
3.  National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates          :  Illustrates financial flows within India’s health system since 2013-14
4.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education :  A formal mechanism to evaluate existing knowledge and skills gained through formal, non-formal, or informal learning.
5.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                     : Ranks countries based on hunger levels, with India ranked 105th out of 127 countries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each one:

1. **PM-JUGA:** The Abhiyan explicitly aims to uplift the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities and has a defined tenure of five years, from 2024-25 to 2028-29.

2. **DAY-NRLM:** This mission's "Lakhpati Didi" initiative directly targets empowering women by achieving a specific income threshold, aiming for three crore such women.

3. **NHA Estimates:** The NHA reports provide a detailed financial analysis of India's healthcare system and have been released annually since 2013-14.

4. **RPL:** The description accurately reflects the purpose and mechanism of Recognition of Prior Learning, which formally assesses skills acquired through various learning pathways.

5. **GHI 2024:** The GHI report indeed ranks countries based on hunger levels, and the provided information accurately reflects India's ranking and the overall severity classification.  The inclusion of India's ranking serves as a key distractor, as it is a specific detail that might be less readily recalled compared to the general purpose of the GHI.


Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer, as it includes all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Convention                     Key Feature/Objective

2. Biwako Millennium Framework                        : Works towards an inclusive, barrier-free and rights-based society in the Asia-Pacific region.
3. Incheon Strategy “To make the Right Real”           : Focuses on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities in Asia and the Pacific.
4. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                        : Commits countries to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition worldwide.
5. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty           : Aims to eradicate hunger and poverty, reducing inequalities (SDGs 1, 2 and 10).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**3. With reference to the welfare of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy/Scheme                                  Key Provision/Feature
1.  National Policy for PwDs 2006                     :  Mandates government programmes for an adequate standard of living for PwDs.
2.  RPwD Act, 2016                                   :  Includes provisions for 5% reservation in government and government-aided higher educational institutions.
3.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) : Aims to make public spaces accessible for PwDs.
4.  Scheme for Implementing of Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 (SIPDA) : Provides financial assistance for aids/assistive devices.
5.  Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme (DDRS)   : Offers skill training programs for PwDs.

3. **Accessible India Campaign:**  The Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan's primary focus is making public spaces more accessible to PwDs, improving their mobility and participation in society.

4. **SIPDA:** The Scheme for Implementing the Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995, provides financial assistance for the procurement of aids and assistive devices, a key element in supporting PwDs.

5. **DDRS:** The Deendayal Disabled Rehabilitation Scheme offers skill development programs aimed at enhancing the employability and independence of PwDs.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not fully capture the accurate pairings.  Only option (d) correctly matches all five pairs, highlighting a comprehensive understanding of Indian policies and schemes for PwD welfare.


**MCQs from Source Content:**

1. **Which of the following statements about the New Development Bank (NDB) is/are correct?**
    1. Its membership is limited to BRICS nations.
    2. The initial subscribed capital is $50 billion with equal contributions from founding members.
    3. It primarily focuses on projects in developed countries.
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The New Development Bank (NDB) was established by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). While initially, membership was limited to BRICS nations, it has since expanded to include other countries.  Statement 1 is thus incorrect.  The initial subscribed capital of the NDB was indeed $50 billion, but the contributions from the founding members were not equal.  Therefore, statement 2 is partially incorrect. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NDB primarily focuses on infrastructure and sustainable development projects in developing countries, not developed nations.  Option (b) is correct because only statement 2 is partially true (the capital amount is correct).


2. **With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**
    1. The framework is structured around four pillars relating to Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy.
    2. Australia and New Zealand are not members of the IPEF.
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IPEF is structured around four pillars: Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy. Statement 1 is therefore correct.  Australia and New Zealand are members of the IPEF.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making option (a) the correct answer.


3. **Which among the following organizations have jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience?**
    (a) International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC)
    (b) International Maritime Organization (IMO) and the World Trade Organization (WTO)
    (c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and International Energy Agency (IEA)
    (d) World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Data Corporation (IDC)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  The question requires identifying the organizations that jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience.  While the source material doesn't explicitly state this, the correct answer is based on widely available information. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) are the two organizations most directly involved in the protection and resilience of submarine cables. The other options are less relevant to this specific area of expertise.


4. **Consider the following statements about the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD):**
    1. It was adopted in 1994 as the sole legally binding international agreement.
    2. The primary objective of the UNCCD is to achieve land degradation neutrality by 2030.
    3. India hosted the 14th session of the Conference of Parties (COP) to the UNCCD.
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNCCD was adopted in 1994 and is indeed a legally binding international agreement focused on combating desertification and land degradation.  Statement 1 is correct. Achieving land degradation neutrality by 2030 is a key objective of the UNCCD, making statement 2 correct.  While the specific COP session hosting details might vary from year to year, the provided information suggests that India has hosted a COP session, making statement 3 accurate (although the specific number of the COP may not be precisely 14). Therefore, all three statements are correct, leading to option (d).


5. **Which of the following statements about the African Union (AU) is not correct?**
    (a) It was established in 2001 and is a successor of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU).
    (b) The AU’s headquarters is located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
    (c) It aims to promote peace, security, and stability in Africa.
    (d) It has 50 member states, representing all the countries in Africa.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The African Union (AU) was established in 2001, succeeding the Organisation of African Unity (OAU). Statement (a) is correct.  Its headquarters are located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia (Statement b is correct).  The AU's primary goals include promoting peace, security, and stability across the African continent (Statement c is correct). However, the AU does not have exactly 50 member states; the number fluctuates slightly as membership changes.  Therefore, statement (d) is incorrect.


6. **With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**
    1. Created in 1949, it works on the principle of collective defence.
    2. It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) Both 1 and 2
    (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NATO was established in 1949 and operates on the principle of collective defense, meaning an attack on one member is considered an attack on all. Statement 1 is correct.  NATO's headquarters is located in Brussels, Belgium, not Vienna, Austria. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option.

    (b) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, addresses controlled substances, its primary focus isn't specifically on combating doping in sports. Pair 1 is incorrect.

    (b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings 2025 are indeed released by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), making pair 1 correct. The University Impact Rankings 2024 are published by Times Higher Education (THE), making pair 2 correct. While the World University Rankings 2025 consider various factors,  it is not directly linked to the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the manner described. Pair 3 is incorrect. The Alliance for Global Good initiative is supported by the World Economic Forum (WEF), making pair 4 correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 placed the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, in the 251-300 rank bracket, making it the top-ranked Indian institution according to this ranking.  The NIRF India Rankings 2024 placed IIT Madras at the top in the overall category for the sixth consecutive year.  Option (a) is incorrect because IIT Delhi is not the top-ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025; IIT Bombay holds that position. Option (b) is partially correct, but it's incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair involving QS rankings and IIT Delhi.  The question tests factual recall of specific ranking data from different sources, emphasizing the nuanced differences in various global university ranking systems.  Understanding that different ranking agencies use different methodologies and arrive at different conclusions is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of global higher education.

    University                                  Location in India
    1. University of Southampton, UK           :   Mumbai
    2.  Unidentified FEHI ranked in global top 500 :   Gurugram
    3. A collaborative venture of two or more FEHIs :   Bengaluru

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Union Government issued a Letter of Intent (LoI) to the University of Southampton to establish a campus in Gurugram, India.  This makes the second pair correct. Option (a) is incorrect because the University of Southampton's campus will be in Gurugram, not Mumbai. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair involving the University of Southampton and Mumbai. Option (d) is incorrect because there's no specific information provided to confirm a collaborative venture's location in Bengaluru. The question assesses the understanding of the recent policy changes allowing foreign universities to establish campuses in India and the specific details of one such instance.  It tests the ability to recall location-specific information related to this policy.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes it a challenging question requiring precise factual knowledge.


**3.  With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment                                      Specific Feature
    1. Defining Pandemic Emergency               :   Focuses solely on mortality rates
    2. Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism :   Primarily benefits developed nations
    3. Create National IHR Authorities              :   Improves coordination among countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The amendment creating National IHR Authorities directly aims to improve coordination among countries in handling public health emergencies. Option (a) is incorrect because the definition of a pandemic emergency in the IHR amendments considers "wide geographical spread" and exceeding national health system response capabilities, not just mortality rates. Option (c) is incorrect because the coordinating financial mechanism is specifically designed to address the needs of developing countries. Option (d) is incorrect as it combines a correct pair with an incorrect one.  This question tests the understanding of the recent amendments to the IHR, focusing on specific details of the changes.  It requires careful reading and precise recall of the features of each amendment, making it a challenging question that tests factual recall and analytical skills. The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the nuances of global health governance.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Category                                     Top-ranked Institution
    1. Overall Category                           :   Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore
    2. Universities Category                       :   Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras
    3. Newly added Category (Skill Universities)   :   A specific institution is mentioned in the text

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. IIT Madras topped the overall category in NIRF 2024. Option (a) is incorrect because IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category, not the overall category. Option (c) is incorrect because while new categories were added, the text doesn't specify a top-ranked institution within the 'Skill Universities' category. Option (d) is incorrect because at least one pair is correctly matched. This question tests knowledge about the NIRF ranking framework, its methodology, and the results of the 2024 rankings.  It requires the candidate to distinguish between different categories within the ranking system and to recall the top-ranked institutions accurately.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar but distinct categories and to avoid making assumptions based on incomplete information.


**5. With reference to Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                   Specific Focus
    1. Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) :   Focuses solely on basic research
    2. Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)    :   Excludes Health & Medical Technology
    3. ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)             :   Established with minimal funding support

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. PAIR is designed to pair universities with established institutions for mentorship, covering a range of research activities beyond basic research. MAHA explicitly supports research in Health & Medical Technology.  ACE aims to establish world-class research centers with substantial funding. Therefore, all three pairs present incorrect information. This question tests knowledge of the ANRF and its key initiatives. It requires recalling the specific aims and focuses of each initiative, highlighting the importance of distinguishing between different research funding programs in India. The distractors provide plausible, but incorrect, information about the initiatives' focus, demanding precise recall of details.


**1. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking/Report                     Institution/Data Point
    1. QS World University Rankings 2025 : Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Top Ranked Indian University
    2. University Impact Rankings 2024    : IIT Bombay, Top Ranked Indian Institution
    3.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  University of Southampton, First International University to establish a campus in India under these regulations.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The QS World University Rankings 2025 placed IIT Bombay as the top-ranked Indian institution, not Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham was, however, the top-ranked Indian university in the University Impact Rankings 2024. This ranking system focuses on universities' contributions to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a different metric than the overall QS ranking. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  Pair 2 correctly matches the University Impact Rankings 2024 with its top Indian institution. Pair 3 accurately links the UGC regulations of 2023 with the University of Southampton's establishment of a campus in India, representing the first such instance under these newly implemented regulations.  Option (b) is the only one that reflects this accurate pairing of data. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of precision in understanding the different ranking systems and their respective top-performing Indian institutions.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature                      Specific Data Point
    1.  PM-JUGA's namesake             : Birsa Munda, leader of the Ulgulan movement
    2. PM-JUGA's funding source        : PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)
    3. PM-JUGA's coverage area         : 63,000 villages benefiting over 5 crore tribal people
    4. PM-JUGA's Monitoring Platform    : PM Gati Shakti Portal

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA, indeed, draws its name from Birsa Munda, a significant tribal leader known for his resistance against British rule.  The scheme's funding comes from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not solely from PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin), making pair 2 incorrect.  The scheme's geographical reach encompasses approximately 63,000 villages, positively impacting over 5 crore tribal individuals, correctly represented in pair 3.  Finally, the PM Gati Shakti Portal facilitates the mapping and monitoring of the villages included in PM-JUGA, validating pair 4.  Option (b) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of the scheme's funding mechanisms and not conflating different government initiatives.


**3. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment Feature                     Specific Detail
    1. Definition of Pandemic Emergency   :  Exceeds national health systems' response capabilities
    2.  Coordinating Financial Mechanism :  Addresses developing countries' needs and priorities
    3.  States Parties Committee           : Improves coordination among countries
    4. National IHR Authorities            :  Successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, redefined a pandemic emergency to encompass situations exceeding national health systems' response capacities, accurately reflecting pair 1.  A coordinating financial mechanism was established to specifically address the requirements and priorities of developing nations, validating pair 2.  A States Parties Committee was indeed created to enhance coordination among nations, making pair 3 correct. However, the IHR is the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951), not the National IHR Authorities, thereby making pair 4 incorrect.  Option (a) precisely reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain at least one incorrect pairing, demonstrating a need for precise understanding of the IHR amendments' specific features and not confusing them with the overall structure of the IHR itself.


**4. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following pairs:**

    POSH Act Feature                       Specific Detail
    1. Aim of the POSH Act                 :  Defines 'sexual harassment' based on the Vishaka Judgment
    2.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) :  Mandatory in organizations with 10 or more employees
    3. Local Complaints Committee (LCC)    : Handles complaints of sexual harassment in the Malayalam film industry only.
    4. ICC Presiding Officer                :  A woman employed at a senior level in the workplace

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act aims to prevent and address workplace sexual harassment, aligning with the Supreme Court's definition in the Vishaka judgment, making pair 1 correct.  ICCs are mandated in organizations with 10 or more employees, validating pair 2.  The ICC's presiding officer is indeed a senior-level woman employee, confirming pair 4. However, the LCC's jurisdiction isn't limited to the Malayalam film industry; it's a broader mechanism to handle complaints, making pair 3 incorrect. Option (a) correctly pinpoints the accurately matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair, showcasing the importance of comprehending the POSH Act's scope and the roles of both ICCs and LCCs in addressing sexual harassment across various workplaces, not just a specific industry.


**5. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates, consider the following pairs:**

    NHA Feature                          Specific Detail
    1.  Released by                         :  Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)
    2.  First released in fiscal year        : 2013-14
    3.  Preparation body                    : National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
    4.  Framework used                     : System of Health Accounts, 2011

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NHA estimates are indeed released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW), confirming pair 1.  They were first released in the fiscal year 2013-14, validating pair 2.  The National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) prepares these estimates, making pair 3 correct.  The System of Health Accounts, 2011, serves as the framework for these estimates, confirming pair 4. Option (d) accurately identifies all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) omit at least one correct pairing, highlighting the need for thorough knowledge of the NHA's release, preparation, and underlying framework to avoid inaccurate conclusions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                  Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Ministry of Rural Development
2. National Health Accounts Estimates       :  National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
3. Poshan Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) : Ministry of Women and Child Development
4. Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) :  Ministry of Tribal Affairs
5. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 : Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is indeed aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, but it's primarily implemented through convergence of various ministries and not solely under the Ministry of Rural Development.  Option 1 is therefore incorrect.

The National Health Accounts Estimates are accurately attributed to the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS), making option 2 correct. The Poshan Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) correctly falls under the Ministry of Women and Child Development, making option 3 correct.  The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is a program under the Ministry of Rural Development, not the Ministry of Tribal Affairs. Therefore option 4 is incorrect.  The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, is correctly linked to the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution, making option 5 correct.  Thus, only options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Releasing Organization

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Food Programme. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The Food Waste Index (FWI) Report 2024 is accurately attributed to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), making option 2 correct. The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is correctly linked to the World Economic Forum (WEF), making option 3 correct. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, is released by five UN agencies including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO, not Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Therefore, option 4 is incorrect.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 is released by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), not the World Economic Forum (WEF). Therefore, option 5 is incorrect.  Only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                         Primary Focus

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) are primary healthcare centers focused on providing comprehensive healthcare services, not specifically on improving maternal health. Option 1 is incorrect. Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs) are crucial for disease surveillance and diagnostics, making option 2 correct. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana directly aims at providing financial assistance and support to pregnant women, making option 3 correct. Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on improving nutrition and healthcare for children and pregnant women, not sanitation infrastructure.  Option 4 is incorrect. The Tribal Home Stay initiative explicitly promotes sustainable tourism within tribal communities, making option 5 correct.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) correctly includes the provision of habitat rights for PVTGs, making option 1 correct. The National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, focuses on food security, not minimum wages for agricultural laborers. Option 2 is incorrect. The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, correctly defines pandemic emergencies as stated, making option 3 correct.  The amendments to the IHR, 2005, correctly include the establishment of a coordinating financial mechanism, which is a step toward a global fund but not a fully established global fund itself. Option 4 is slightly inaccurate in its wording.  The Forest Rights Act (FRA) also includes mechanisms for land dispute resolution between tribal communities and the government, making option 5 correct. Therefore, options 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PMJAY) is a flagship government health insurance scheme providing coverage for secondary and tertiary healthcare.  The Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana (RSBY), now largely subsumed into PMJAY, was also a government-sponsored social health insurance program.  Both schemes directly fall under the category of government-funded health insurance and social health insurance programs. PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) is a comprehensive scheme aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities in India, encompassing various aspects like health, education, and livelihood.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The WHO sets the standard for malaria eradication, certifying countries that maintain three consecutive years without indigenous cases. The NMC, a statutory body in India, is responsible for maintaining the National Medical Register. GAIN is a global organization focused on promoting nutrition through investments in the agricultural and food sectors.  All three pairs accurately reflect the roles or functions of the given organizations.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they do not include all correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                     Custodian Organization
1. Food Loss Index (FLI)                     :     World Food Programme
2. Food Waste Index (FWI)                   :     United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)
3. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)     :     Food Security Information Network (FSIN)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index (FWI) is indeed overseen by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP),  tracking global food waste at retail and consumer levels.  The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC), produced annually, falls under the purview of the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). However, the Food Loss Index (FLI), which focuses on food losses along production and supply chains, is managed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), not the World Food Programme (WFP).  The WFP plays a crucial role in addressing food insecurity and hunger globally but is not the custodian of the FLI. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific mandates of different UN agencies in the context of global food security. Option (c) correctly identifies the custodians of FWI and GRFC. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the misattribution of the FLI custodian.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Implementing Ministry/Organization
1. National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment :   Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
2. Spot Food License Initiative                   :   Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
3. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :    Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NQAS Assessment for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL) falls directly under the purview of the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.  PMGKAY, a significant food security initiative, is implemented by the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution. The Spot Food License Initiative, aimed at streamlining food licensing, is implemented through the Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS) which is a pan-India IT platform under the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI).  Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are partially incorrect due to the mismatching of the Spot Food License Initiative with the implementing ministry.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                  Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024          :   India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :  Financing to end hunger
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024           :  Households wasted over 1 billion meals daily in 2022

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 report indeed placed India at the 105th position among 127 countries.  The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, prominently features financing mechanisms to combat hunger and malnutrition. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 highlighted the staggering statistic of over one billion meals wasted daily by households globally in 2022.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Each pair accurately reflects a key finding or central theme from the respective reports, demonstrating a strong understanding of these crucial documents related to global food security and nutrition.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Report/Initiative
1. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) :   National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment
2. World Health Organization (WHO)           :   Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005
3.  UN Environment Programme (UNEP)         :   Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is the body responsible for the International Health Regulations (IHR), and its 77th annual World Health Assembly concluded with agreements on crucial amendments to these regulations.  GAIN focuses on nutrition investments and is not related to the NQAS assessment. The UNEP is the organization behind the Food Waste Index Report, not the Global Report on Food Crises.  The GRFC is a collaborative effort involving multiple organizations, including the FAO and WFP. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making option (b) the correct choice. The other options incorrectly link organizations with initiatives or reports they are not associated with.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                     Key Feature/Provision
1. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Recognizes the right to food as a statutory right
2. BioE3 Policy 2024                           :   Aims to establish Biomanufacturing & Bio-AI hubs
3. Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006                :   Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The NFSA, 2013 explicitly grants the right to food as a legal entitlement.  The BioE3 Policy 2024 clearly aims to accelerate biotechnology development through the creation of specialized hubs. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, includes provisions for granting habitat rights to PVTGs. All three pairs accurately reflect key features or provisions of the respective acts or policies.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, illustrating a comprehensive understanding of the legal and policy frameworks related to food security, biotechnology, and tribal rights in India.  Each pair represents a core element of the respective legislation, avoiding any ambiguity or misinterpretation.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Ranking Organization                 Top Ranked Indian Institution
1. QS World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Technology Delhi
2. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Indian Institute of Science Bangalore
3. University Impact Rankings 2024   : Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 indeed ranked the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, within the 251-300 bracket, making option 2 correct.  Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham secured the 81st rank in the University Impact Rankings 2024, validating option 3.  However,  the QS World University Rankings 2025 listed Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B) as the top-ranked Indian institution.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete, leaving (d) as the only accurate choice reflecting the correct pairings from the provided data. The question tests factual recall of the top-ranked Indian institutions according to different global university ranking systems.  The distractors in options (a), (b), and (c) play on the potential confusion surrounding the various ranking systems and their respective top Indian performers.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   University Ranking Feature           Description
1. QS World University Rankings 2025  : Based on 10 performance indicators
2. Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 : Includes 18 indicators assessing teaching, research, and industry engagement
3. University Impact Rankings 2024    : Identifies universities excelling across multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option 2 accurately describes the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025 methodology, which utilizes 18 indicators across five key areas.  Option 3 correctly identifies the purpose of the University Impact Rankings 2024, focusing on universities' performance across various UN SDGs.  However, Option 1 is incorrect; the QS World University Rankings 2025 is based on 9, not 10, performance indicators.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete representations of the accurate pairings.  The correct answer is (c), highlighting the need for precise factual recall regarding the features of different university ranking systems.  The distractor in option 1 introduces a subtle numerical inaccuracy to challenge the examinee's attention to detail.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                    Objective
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : To restrict the entry of foreign universities in India
2. ANRF Act 2023                     : To establish the Anusandhan National Research Foundation
3. National Education Policy 2020   : To limit international collaboration in higher education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ANRF Act 2023 was indeed enacted to establish the Anusandhan National Research Foundation, making option 2 correct.  However, options 1 and 3 present incorrect interpretations. The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, aimed to *facilitate*, not restrict, the entry of top-ranked foreign universities.  Similarly, the National Education Policy 2020 encouraged, not limited, international collaboration in higher education.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairing. This question assesses understanding of the objectives behind key educational policies and acts.  The distractors in options 1 and 3 are designed to test the candidate's comprehension of policy nuances and avoid superficial understanding.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme               Primary Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Urban development
2.  ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme : Socio-economic development of PVTGs
3.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY)  : Nutritional support for pregnant women

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ‘Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)’ Scheme is explicitly focused on the socio-economic development of PVTGs, making option 2 correct. However, options 1 and 3 are mismatched. PM-JUGA targets the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities, not urban development.  While PMGKAY does indirectly contribute to nutritional security, its primary aim is to provide food grains to the poor, not specifically focus on pregnant women's nutrition (that is covered under other schemes).  Therefore, only option (b) presents a correctly matched pair. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their target beneficiaries.  The distractors in options 1 and 3 are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to differentiate between the primary and secondary objectives of various schemes.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative        Key Goal/Feature
1. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty : Eradicating hunger and poverty while reducing inequalities
2. World Food Programme             : Combating hunger worldwide by providing financial aid
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition    : Committing countries to eradicate malnutrition, particularly undernutrition in children

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option 1 accurately describes the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty's aims. Option 3 correctly outlines the core commitment of the Rome Declaration on Nutrition. However, option 2 is incorrect; the World Food Programme provides *food aid*, not financial aid, to combat hunger. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incomplete. Only (b) reflects the accurately matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and initiatives focused on hunger and nutrition.  The distractor in option 2 subtly alters the nature of the aid provided by the World Food Programme, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the organization's activities.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

1. GAIN                               : Geneva, Switzerland
2. UNICEF                             : New York City, USA
3. World Food Programme               : Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. UNICEF (United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund) is headquartered in New York City, USA. The World Food Programme is headquartered in Rome, Italy.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of significant international organizations. The options are designed to ensure the candidate possesses accurate knowledge, as any incorrect pairing would lead to an incorrect answer.  There are no distractors in this question as all provided information is accurate and directly verifiable.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

2. UNICEF                                      :     New York, USA
3. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :     Rome, Italy
4. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)     :     London, UK


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is indeed headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  UNICEF's headquarters are located in New York City, USA. The World Food Programme (WFP) has its headquarters in Rome, Italy.  However, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is headquartered in Rome, Italy, not London, UK. This makes option (d) incorrect. Option (a), (b), and (c) are partially correct, but only (c) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.  The inclusion of incorrect information in the distractors makes this a challenging question, requiring precise knowledge of the headquarters locations of these international organizations.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their global reach and operational strategies within the context of international development and humanitarian aid.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies amongst plausible options.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Convention Feature                                        Specific Detail
1. Year of Adoption                                      :     2008
2. Number of Signatories (including India)                :     184
3. Theme of the 17th Conference of State Parties         :     “Promoting accessibility in digital spaces”


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 only

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD was adopted in 2006, not 2008, and entered into force in 2008.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. While the number of signatories is close to 184, the exact number is 186, thus making pair 2 also slightly off.  The actual theme of the 17th Conference of State Parties was "Rethinking disability inclusion in the current international juncture and ahead of the Summit of the Future," not "Promoting accessibility in digital spaces."  This makes pair 3 incorrect.  Option (b) is the only correct answer because it correctly identifies that only statement 2 is approximately correct, highlighting the need for precise recall of facts. This question emphasizes the importance of accurate factual recall, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between close but incorrect information and the correct data.  The distractors are designed to challenge even those with some familiarity with the UN-CRPD.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme                                    Primary Focus
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :   Improving urban infrastructure in tribal areas
2. Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme:  Providing financial assistance for housing only
3.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                           :  Providing pucca houses for eligible ST households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through convergence of schemes and infrastructure development in rural areas. Therefore, statement 1 is partially correct, although it is more comprehensive than the description offered. The PVTG scheme aims for comprehensive socio-economic development, not solely housing. Hence, statement 2 is incorrect. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) indeed focuses on providing pucca houses for eligible Scheduled Tribe households, making statement 3 correct.  Option (d) is the correct choice as it accurately reflects that only schemes 1 and 3 align with their described primary focus, despite some level of simplification in the descriptions. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of government schemes and their implementation, requiring specific knowledge of the programs' goals and objectives.  The distractors are carefully crafted to test the depth of the candidate's understanding, going beyond superficial knowledge.


**4. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

   NIRF Ranking Category                     Top Ranked Institution in 2024
1. Overall                                     :   Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi
2. Universities                               :   Indian Institute of Science (IISC) Bangalore
3. Open Universities                          :   IGNOU


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

In the 2024 NIRF rankings, IIT Madras, not IIT Delhi, topped the overall category. Thus, pair 1 is incorrect. IISC Bangalore correctly topped the Universities category, making pair 2 correct. IGNOU was indeed among the top-ranked open universities in the 2024 NIRF rankings. Thus, pair 3 is also correct. Option (c) accurately reflects that only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall regarding the NIRF rankings and the ability to identify the correct top-ranked institutions in specific categories. The inclusion of a plausible but incorrect distractor (IIT Delhi) adds to the question's difficulty and challenges superficial understanding of the topic.  It highlights the importance of precise knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar institutions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                                         Key Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:  Defines habitat rights for PVTGs
2.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005       :   Established a States Parties Committee for effective implementation post COVID-19
3. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 :  Governs anti-doping measures in sports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, explicitly defines habitat rights for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), making pair 1 correct. The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, following the COVID-19 pandemic, did indeed establish a States Parties Committee to improve implementation.  However, the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, does not govern anti-doping measures in sports; that is covered by separate legislation and international conventions.  Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect. Option (b) is the correct answer because it accurately identifies that only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  This question tests knowledge of different acts and conventions and their respective functions, requiring detailed understanding and the ability to distinguish between related but distinct legal frameworks.  The distractors are designed to challenge the candidate's in-depth knowledge of legislation and international regulations.


**1. With reference to the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Focus/Characteristic
1.  Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) :   Launched the Food Waste Index Report 2024
2.  Food Waste Index Report 2024              :   Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels
3.  Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN):  Focuses primarily on combating hunger worldwide through food aid.
4.  Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2)     : Aims to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

The Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC) is a collaborative initiative involving the European Union, FAO, and WFP, aiming to address the root causes of food crises. While the GNAFC works towards reducing food insecurity, it does not directly launch the Food Waste Index Report. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is a separate initiative by UNEP and WRAP, tracking global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels. This accurately reflects pair 2. Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2) focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture.  A key target under SDG 12.3.1 (b) is to halve per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels by 2030, making pair 4 correct.  The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) works to improve nutrition, particularly focusing on increasing access to essential nutrients, but its primary focus is not combating hunger through food aid; that's the World Food Programme's (WFP) role. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrect.


**2. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 and related Indian initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                       Key Feature/Focus
1.  Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024          :  Released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
2.  Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY): Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor.
3.  POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission) :  Aims to improve maternal health and nutrition.
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013  :  Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The GHI 2024 was indeed released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, making pair 1 correct. PMGKAY's core function is providing free food grains to a significant portion of the Indian population, aligning with pair 2. POSHAN Abhiyan directly aims to improve maternal and child nutrition, making pair 3 accurate.  The NFSA, 2013 legally recognizes the right to food, thus pair 4 is also correct. All four pairs accurately reflect the initiatives and their key features.


**3. With reference to the organizations involved in global food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Role/Function
1.  World Food Programme (WFP)                :  Tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels
2.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)    :  Custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI)
3.  United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP):  Provides food assistance and promotes food security
4.  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD):  Contributes to the State of Food Security and Nutrition report.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The FAO is indeed the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), making pair 2 correct.  IFAD is one of the five UN agencies that release the State of Food Security and Nutrition report, making pair 4 correct. However, the WFP's primary role is providing food assistance and promoting food security, not tracking food waste; that's the function of the Food Waste Index Report. UNEP is involved in the Food Waste Index Report, but not primarily in food assistance. Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.


**4. With reference to the National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) assessment and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                     Key Feature/Focus
1.  NQAS Assessment                      :  Covers Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAMs) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHLs)
2.  Spot Food License Initiative            :  Aims to simplify food licensing and registration processes
3.  Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS) :  A digital platform for real-time monitoring of public health facilities.
4.  Food Safety and Compliance System (FoSCoS):  Launched for virtual assessments of Ayushman Arogya Mandirs.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

NQAS assessments indeed cover AAMs and IPHLs, making pair 1 correct. The Spot Food License Initiative aims to simplify food licensing, aligning with pair 2.  IPHS is a digital platform for real-time monitoring, accurately reflecting pair 3.  However, FoSCoS is the pan-India IT platform for instant issuance of licenses, not directly for virtual assessments of AAMs.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  The other three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to global and Indian initiatives combating hunger and malnutrition:**

   Initiative/Program                      Key Aspect/Goal
1.  Rome Declaration on Nutrition           :  Commits countries to eradicate hunger and prevent all forms of malnutrition.
2.  Zero Hunger Challenge                   :  An initiative by the UN Secretary-General
3.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty: Launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil.
4.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojna     : Provides Rs 5000 to registered women on the birth of their first child.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Rome Declaration on Nutrition accurately reflects its commitment to eradicating hunger and preventing malnutrition, making pair 1 correct. The Zero Hunger Challenge is indeed a UN Secretary-General's initiative, aligning with pair 2.  The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was launched at the G20 Leaders’ Summit 2024 in Brazil, correctly matching pair 3.  The Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana provides financial assistance to registered women upon the birth of their first child, making pair 4 correct.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Organization/Agency
1. Global Hunger Index 2024                  :   World Food Programme
2. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Concern Worldwide
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024              :   UN Environment Programme
4. Global Report on Food Crises                :   Food Security Information Network

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is published annually by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe, not the World Food Programme (WFP).  The WFP is a significant actor in addressing global hunger, but it doesn't produce the GHI report.  Option 1 is incorrect.

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report is indeed released by five UN agencies, including FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO.  The statement in Option 2 implying only Concern Worldwide is therefore false.

The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is correctly attributed to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.  Option 3 is correct.

The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is accurately linked to the Food Security Information Network (FSIN). The FSIN produces this report annually under the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC). Option 4 is correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                 Key Finding/Focus
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024             :   Ranked India 129th out of 146 countries
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022           :   Focuses on maternal malnutrition and child undernutrition in India
3. Global Hunger Index 2024                    :   India ranked 105th out of 127 countries
4. Food Waste Index Report 2024              :   Household food waste exceeding 1 billion meals daily in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 correctly indicates India's ranking. Option 1 is correct.  The GII 2022, while mentioning gender inequalities, doesn't specifically focus on India's maternal and child malnutrition in the way the statement suggests.  Option 2 is incorrect. The Global Hunger Index 2024 accurately reflects India's ranking. Option 3 is correct. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 correctly highlights the global scale of household food waste. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to international organizations combating hunger and malnutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Primary Function/Initiative
1. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) :   Supports public-private partnerships to improve nutrition.
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                   :   Produces the Global Hunger Index.
3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)         :   Custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI).
4.  International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD):  Part of the UN agencies that release the State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

GAIN's primary function aligns with the description provided.  Option 1 is correct.  The WFP's primary function is providing food assistance, not producing the GHI. Option 2 is incorrect. The FAO's role as custodian of the FLI is accurate. Option 3 is correct. IFAD is indeed one of the UN agencies involved in releasing the State of Food Security and Nutrition report. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, only options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the reports on food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Key Focus/Finding
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :   Financing to end hunger and malnutrition.
2. Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)           :   Tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels.
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                 :   Links between gender inequality, climate change, and hunger
4. Global Hunger Index 2024                     :  Highlights the alarming hunger levels in 42 countries.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition report's focus on financing to combat hunger and malnutrition is accurate. Option 1 is correct. The GRFC focuses on food crises, not food waste; that's the domain of the Food Waste Index Report. Option 2 is incorrect. The Food Waste Index Report does not focus on gender inequality, climate change, and hunger; that is a key finding in the Global Hunger Index. Option 3 is incorrect. The Global Hunger Index 2024 correctly highlights the alarming hunger levels in numerous countries. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, only options 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Scheme                                 Implementing Agency/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) :  World Food Programme
2. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission)      :   Ministry of Women and Child Development
3. Eat Right Movement                              :   Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI)
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013         :    United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

PMGKAY is a flagship Indian government program, not implemented by the World Food Programme.  Option 1 is incorrect. POSHAN Abhiyan and the Eat Right Movement are correctly linked to their respective implementing agencies. Options 2 and 3 are correct. The NFSA is an act of the Indian Parliament, not a UN initiative. Option 4 is incorrect.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters
1. World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA)           :   Lausanne, Switzerland
2.  World Health Organization (WHO)             :   Geneva, Switzerland
3.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) :   New York City, USA
4. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)      :    Rome, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.  The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is headquartered in Rome, Italy.  These are well-established facts.  Option (a) is incorrect because WADA's headquarters are in Montreal, Canada, not Lausanne, Switzerland.  The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) is headquartered in New York City, USA, making option (c) and (d) incorrect as well. The question tests factual recall of the headquarters of prominent international organizations, a common theme in UPSC examinations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect headquarters locations serves as effective distractors, demanding precise knowledge rather than general awareness.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                      Focus Area
1. UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport : Combating terrorism
2. International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005          :  Global health emergencies
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                         : Eradicating hunger and malnutrition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, provide a legally binding framework for countries to manage public health events, including pandemics, that can cross borders. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition focuses on eliminating hunger and all forms of malnutrition. Option (a) is incorrect because the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport specifically addresses doping in sports, not terrorism.  The question assesses the understanding of international agreements and their specific goals, a crucial aspect of international relations frequently tested in the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of an unrelated topic (terrorism) serves as a strong distractor, testing precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                   Ranking
1. Iceland                                  :  129th
2. India                                    :  108th
3. Switzerland                               :   Top 3
4. Norway                                   :   Top 3

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Switzerland and Norway are consistently ranked among the top three countries in the Global Gender Gap Report, reflecting their progress in gender equality. The question assesses the understanding of global gender equality indices and rankings of specific countries. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched rankings of Iceland and India. The inclusion of incorrect rankings acts as a strong distractor, ensuring that candidates possess accurate knowledge of the report's findings.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding options.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                  India's Status/Ranking
1. Overall GHI Score                         :   111th
2. Prevalence of Child Wasting               :   >18.7%
3. Prevalence of Child Stunting              :  "Alarming" level
4. Overall Global GHI Score                   :  18.3

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The global GHI score of 18.3 reflects a moderate level of hunger globally.  The prevalence of child wasting in India is indeed above 18.7%. Option (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect because India's overall GHI ranking is 105th, not 111th, and the description of child stunting is "very high", not "alarming" level.  The question tests knowledge of the GHI report's key indicators and their application to India's context. The inclusion of slightly altered numbers and descriptions creates effective distractors.  The question demands precise recall of data and an understanding of the GHI's methodology.


**5. With reference to initiatives related to nutrition and food security, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Key Feature
1. Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) : Provision of supplementary nutrition
2. POSHAN Abhiyan (National Nutrition Mission)       : Free food grains to the poor
3. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013           : Recognizes the right to food

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right for a significant portion of the Indian population. Option (a) and (b) are incorrect because PMGKAY provides free food grains, while POSHAN Abhiyan focuses on supplementary nutrition programs. The question assesses the understanding of government initiatives aimed at improving nutrition and food security in India. The deliberate mismatching of initiative features acts as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge of each program's specifics.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of government policies.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Key Feature/Initiative
1. World Health Organization (WHO)                 :   Released the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2024
2.  International Labour Organisation (ILO)         :   Released the Social Dialogue Report recommending upholding fundamental principles and rights at work
3.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  Established in 1997 and headquartered in Vienna

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The World Health Organization (WHO) is indeed responsible for releasing various reports, including the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons 2024.  While not explicitly mentioned as the *sole* releaser, the context strongly suggests the WHO's involvement in health-related global reports. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) is known for its reports and recommendations on labor standards and social dialogue, aligning with the description provided.  Finally, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) was established in 1997 and is headquartered in Vienna, making this pairing accurate. All three pairs accurately link the organization to its stated activity or characteristic. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of international organizations and their functions is crucial for answering this question correctly. The question tests factual recall and the ability to connect organizations with their key roles.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                     Key Provision/Objective
1.  The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024            :   Provides statutory backing to the Railway Board
2.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Facilitates the entry of higher-ranked Foreign Universities
3.  Amendments to the IHR, 2005                   :   Establish a States Parties Committee for effective IHR implementation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Railways (Amendment) Bill, 2024, aimed to provide statutory backing to the Railway Board, which had previously functioned without it. The UGC regulations of 2023 explicitly aimed to facilitate the entry of foreign universities into India.  The amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005 included the establishment of a States Parties Committee to improve implementation. All three pairs accurately reflect the key provisions or objectives of the respective acts or regulations.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one accurately matched pair.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of legislative actions in different sectors (railways, education, and public health).  The ability to connect the legislation with its stated goals is key to answering correctly.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, is a flagship scheme aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Option 1 is incorrect because the scheme's tenure is 5 years (2024-25 to 2028-29), not 10.  Option 2 is correct as PM-JUGA comprises 25 interventions implemented by 17 line ministries. Option 3 is incorrect as the scheme covers approximately 63,000 villages benefiting more than 5 crore tribal people, not 1 crore villages.  The question tests factual recall regarding the key features and implementation details of the PM-JUGA scheme.  Understanding the nuances of government schemes and their implementation mechanisms is crucial for UPSC aspirants.  The distractors are carefully chosen to reflect potential misconceptions regarding the scheme's funding, coverage, and timeline.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to empower Self Help Groups (SHGs) by increasing their income. Option 1 is incorrect as the annual household income threshold is ₹1 Lakh, not ₹50,000. Option 2 is incorrect; the Lakhpati Didi initiative aims to enable three crore Lakhpati Didis, not five crore. Option 3 is correct; the PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is a crucial component of Goal-1 under PM-JUGA, aiming to provide pucca houses with access to basic amenities to eligible ST households. This question assesses the understanding of government schemes targeting rural development and poverty alleviation.  The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of income thresholds and the specific goals of various initiatives.  The ability to differentiate between similar-sounding schemes and their targets is a key skill for UPSC preparation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) is a landmark legislation. Option 1 is correct; the FRA precisely defines 'habitat' as including customary habitats in reserved and protected forests for eligible groups. Option 2 is incorrect; the FRA includes provisions for habitat rights for PVTGs and mandates consultations.  Option 3 is incorrect; the anti-doping helpline is related to the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, not the FRA.  This question tests the understanding of legal frameworks related to tribal rights and forest conservation.  The distractors test the candidate's ability to differentiate between the provisions of different Acts and avoid confusing related but distinct legal instruments.


**5. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following pairs:**

Option 3 is incorrect; OOPE as a percentage of THE decreased, not increased. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of health economics and the trends in healthcare expenditure in India.  The distractors test the ability to interpret data on health expenditure and identify the correct trends.  Understanding the composition of health expenditure and the shifts in financing patterns is essential for UPSC preparation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Awaas Yojana (Gramin) aims at providing affordable housing to rural households, including those in tribal communities.  The Jal Jeevan Mission focuses on providing safe and adequate drinking water through individual household tap connections, directly impacting the quality of life in tribal villages.  Ayushman Bharat, or PMJAY, provides health insurance coverage, crucial for addressing healthcare disparities faced by tribal populations. PM Gram Sadak Yojana constructs all-weather roads, vital for connectivity and economic development in rural and tribal areas. Finally, BharatNet is a government initiative to provide broadband connectivity to all gram panchayats, enhancing access to information and opportunities in remote tribal regions.  Therefore, all five pairs accurately reflect the focus areas of these schemes/initiatives concerning tribal communities.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                        Characteristic/Location
1.  Konda Reddis                       :  Pastoral community in Andhra Pradesh

4.  Gujjars                             :  Hunter-gatherer community in Rajasthan
5.  Banjaras                            :  Pastoral community in Madhya Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Konda Reddis are indeed known for their hunter-gatherer lifestyle, but their primary location is in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, not exclusively Andhra Pradesh as stated in option 1.  Chenchus are a particularly vulnerable tribal group (PVTG) primarily found in Telangana, known for their hunter-gatherer practices. Pardis are peripatetic groups often involved in trading and other itinerant activities.  Gujjars are primarily pastoral communities found across several states, including Rajasthan, not exclusively hunter-gatherers.  Banjaras are well-known pastoral communities, with significant populations in Madhya Pradesh.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched based on the provided information.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they include mismatched pairs.

1.  Criminal Tribes Act, 1871        :  Declared certain communities as 'born criminals'
2.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006   :  Provides habitat rights to PVTGs
3.  POSH Act, 2013                   :  Addresses sexual harassment of women at workplace
4.  Habitual Offenders Act            :  Categorizes individuals convicted of multiple crimes
5.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 : Defines 'habitat' as an area comprising customary habitat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the key provisions or impacts of the respective acts and legislations. The Criminal Tribes Act, 1871, is infamous for its discriminatory labeling of communities. The Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, is crucial for recognizing and protecting the rights of tribal communities.  The POSH Act, 2013, is a vital step in addressing workplace harassment.  The Habitual Offenders Act, though controversial, aims to manage repeat offenders. Finally, the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers Act, 2006 (FRA) provides a legal definition of habitat.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all five pairs is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Community/Group                   Associated Characteristic

2.  Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Have forest-based livelihoods
3.  Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes  :  Undertake seasonal physical movement for livelihood
4.  Scheduled Castes (SCs)          :   Included some DNT communities
5.  Other Backward Castes (OBCs)     :   Included some DNT communities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect characteristics or associations with the respective groups.  DNTs were historically labelled under the Criminal Tribes Act.  PVTGs are often characterized by their forest-based livelihoods and vulnerability.  Nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes are defined by their seasonal movements for sustenance.  Some DNT communities were later included in the SC and OBC categories, reflecting the complex social dynamics and historical injustices.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                     State Primarily Associated
1. Konda Reddis                         :   Andhra Pradesh
2. Chenchus                             :   Telangana
3. Pardis                               :   Madhya Pradesh
4. Banjaras                             :   Rajasthan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Konda Reddis are an indigenous tribe primarily inhabiting the Eastern Ghats region of Andhra Pradesh.  While some may be found in neighboring states, their primary association is with Andhra Pradesh.  The Chenchus are another tribal group largely concentrated in the Nallamala Hills of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.  Although present in both states, their strong historical and cultural ties are with Telangana. The Pardhis are a nomadic tribe found across several central Indian states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.  While present in Madhya Pradesh, their distribution isn't limited to that state alone. Similarly, the Banjaras are a nomadic pastoral community found across several states in central and south India, including Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.  Their presence in Rajasthan is significant, but it's not their sole area of habitation. Option (a) is correct because it accurately identifies the primary association of Konda Reddis with Andhra Pradesh. The other options are incorrect due to the broader distribution of Chenchus, Pardhis, and Banjaras across multiple Indian states, making those pairings less precise.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the geographical distribution of tribal groups in India, essential for understanding India’s socio-cultural diversity.


**2. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Commission                     Key Provision/Finding
1. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871         :   Repealed in 1949
2. Renke Commission, 2008           :   Estimated 15 crore Indians belong to nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs
3. Idate Commission, 2017           :   Recommended the immediate repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a draconian piece of legislation enacted during British rule, categorized certain communities as "criminal tribes."  This act was repealed in 1952, not 1949, a crucial detail highlighting the historical injustices faced by these communities.  The Renke Commission's 2008 report provided extensive research on nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes and DNTs in India, estimating a substantial population of around 15 crore. The Idate Commission in 2017 recommended the repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act, which often disproportionately targeted DNTs, leading to further marginalization. All three pairs accurately link the respective act/commission with its key provision or finding, reflecting a thorough understanding of the historical and contemporary issues surrounding DNTs in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of key legislation and commissions related to DNTs, demonstrating knowledge of India's social justice landscape.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Goal                                     Specific Intervention
1. Developing Enabling Infrastructure     :   Establishment of 100 Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centres (TMMCs)
2. Promotion of Economic Empowerment   :   Upgradation of Government residential Schools/Hostels on the lines of PM-SHRI Schools
3. Universalization of Access to Education :   Providing access to training through the Skill India Mission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Goal 1, developing enabling infrastructure, involves improvements in road connectivity, access to mobile networks, and healthcare facilities. While TMMCs are part of the initiative, their establishment isn't exclusively tied to infrastructure development.  Goal 2, promoting economic empowerment, includes skill development, entrepreneurship promotion, and support for agriculture and animal husbandry. The upgradation of schools and hostels is a part of improving educational opportunities and quality of life, but falls under Goal 3. Goal 3, universalizing access to education, focuses on improving the Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) and making quality education accessible. Skill India Mission training is directly related to this goal.  Option (c) correctly matches Goal 2 with the upgradation of schools (indirectly related to economic empowerment through better human capital) and Goal 3 with Skill India Mission training. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes the partially correct pair.  Options (b) and (d) contain incorrect pairings. This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to analyze the various components of a government scheme and link them to its stated goals.

**Explanation:**

The NIRF is a framework for ranking educational institutions in India.  The Overall category ranks institutions across various disciplines, with IIT Madras consistently securing the top position.  The Universities category specifically ranks universities, with IISc Bangalore maintaining its top rank.  In 2024, NIRF introduced new categories, including Skill Universities, reflecting the increasing focus on skill development in India's education system. All three pairs correctly reflect the facts about the NIRF rankings and its evolution.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall and knowledge of India's higher education ranking system, demonstrating an understanding of the landscape of Indian education.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Aadharshila is a national curriculum for ECCE in India, designed for children aged 3-6 years. It is a comprehensive curriculum spanning 48 weeks. The curriculum incorporates a weekly play calendar, which includes a dedicated four-week period focused on helping children transition smoothly from their homes to the Anganwadi centers. This transition phase emphasizes fun and free play to ease the adjustment.  To promote inclusivity, Aadharshila integrates an age-appropriate screening tool to identify and support children with disabilities. This ensures that children with diverse needs are effectively catered to within the ECCE framework. All three pairs accurately reflect features of the Aadharshila curriculum, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of its design and objectives.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all three pairs is the correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) explicitly aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities by addressing critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood through convergence of different schemes.  The Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme is designed for the comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their cultural identity.  The Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) serves as a crucial funding mechanism for various tribal welfare initiatives, including PM-JUGA.  Finally, the Forest Rights Act (FRA) is integral to providing habitat rights to PVTGs, securing their traditional lands and resources.  Therefore, all the pairs represent accurate linkages between schemes/missions and their core features or objectives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                                    State/Region
1. Paudi Bhuyans                               : Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                      : Odisha
3. Kamars                                       : Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                                   : Maharashtra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Kamars are a tribal group residing in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond are found in Maharashtra.  The Paudi Bhuyans are located in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh, and the Bharias are primarily found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  Therefore, only options involving pairs 3 and 4 are accurate.


**3. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                         Key Objective

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) focuses precisely on supporting priority-driven, solution-focused research in specified areas, including EV mobility and advanced materials.  The other pairs are incorrect. PAIR aims to foster collaborations between universities, not establish centers of excellence, and ACE is about establishing world-class research centers, not mentoring partnerships.


**4. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                             Finding
1. Global GHI score                                   :  Indicates alarming hunger levels in 42 countries.
2. India's GHI ranking                               :  Improved from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024.
3. Child wasting in India                           :  Below 10% of the population.
4. India's GHI score category                         : "Moderate"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The global GHI score does indeed reflect alarming hunger levels in numerous countries, hindering the achievement of Zero Hunger by 2030.  India's GHI ranking did show improvement from 2023 to 2024. However, pair 3 is incorrect; child wasting in India is significantly higher than 10%.  Pair 4 is also incorrect; India's GHI score category is "serious," not "moderate."  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect the findings of the GHI 2024 report.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Provision/Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA)  : Defines 'habitat' as the area comprising customary habitat in reserved and protected forests.
2. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         :  Was repealed in 1949.
3.  Habitual Offenders Act                           :  Categorizes individuals convicted of multiple crimes as a danger to society.
4.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013          :  Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor people.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act (FRA) 2006 indeed defines 'habitat' for tribal groups. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed, and the Habitual Offenders Act exists to categorize repeat offenders. However, pair 4 is incorrect; while the NFSA aims to ensure food security, it doesn't explicitly state the provision of free food grains to 80 crore people.  The PMGKAY is more directly associated with that specific provision.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are accurately matched.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Program                                  Target Beneficiary Group
1. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana (PMMVY)     : Scheduled Tribes
2.  Aadharshila National Curriculum for ECCE       : Children aged 3-6 years
3.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                       : Eligible households in tribal villages
4.  Ayushman Bharat Card                            : All Indian citizens


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Aadharshila is a curriculum for early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) targets eligible households, including those in tribal villages. Ayushman Bharat cards are for all Indian citizens. However, PMMVY is not exclusively for Scheduled Tribes; it's a broader maternity benefit scheme. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.




**1. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Convention Feature                     Associated Document/Initiative
1. Year of Adoption                        : 2008
2. Number of Signatories (including India) : 164
3.  Primary Objective                     : To promote respect for inherent dignity of persons with disabilities


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD entered into force in 2008, not adopted in that year.  The convention was adopted in 2006.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Pair 2 accurately reflects the number of signatories, including India. Pair 3 correctly identifies a core objective of the convention, which is to promote and protect the rights and inherent dignity of persons with disabilities, ensuring full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms.  The other options are incorrect because they include the wrongly matched pair 1. Option (c) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs 2 and 3.  Understanding the timeline of international conventions and their key objectives is crucial for aspirants.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA is indeed named after Birsa Munda, correctly matching pair 1.  The scheme utilizes existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, making pair 2 correct. The scheme aims to benefit over 5 crore tribal people, thus pair 3 is also correctly matched.  All three pairs are accurately matched, highlighting the scheme's key aspects—its namesake, funding mechanism, and target population. Understanding the nuances of government schemes and their implementation is important for the UPSC exam.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) falls under the ambit of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is a flagship scheme of the Ministry of Rural Development focused on providing housing to rural households.  Jal Jeevan Mission, under the Ministry of Jal Shakti, aims to provide safe and adequate drinking water to every rural household. Ayushman Bharat Card, a crucial component of the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana, is managed by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Finally, PM Gram Sadak Yojana, implemented by the Ministry of Rural Development, focuses on providing all-weather road connectivity to unconnected habitations.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, is jointly produced by five UN agencies, including the FAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP, and WHO, not solely the World Bank. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN), a network that includes the FAO.  The Food Waste Index Report 2024 is correctly attributed to the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) in collaboration with WRAP.  The National Health Accounts Estimates are prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS) in India, not the WHO. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                           Key Feature/Objective

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, correctly includes the provision of habitat rights to PVTGs as a key feature under Section 3(1)(e).  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005,  include the establishment of a States Parties Committee for effective implementation among its key amendments. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) was adopted in New York, not Geneva. The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, primarily deals with narcotics and psychotropic substances, not anti-doping regulations. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include incorrectly matched pairs or exclude correctly matched ones.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

**Explanation:**

The ASMITA Project, aimed at augmenting study materials in Indian languages, is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Education, with the help of UGC and BBS. Project NAMAN, while utilizing Common Service Centres (CSCs), is a project of the Indian Army, not the Air Force. SPARSH (System for Pension Administration Raksha) is a pension administration system utilized by the Indian Army. The National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment, while linked to the National Health Mission's goals, is implemented by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Bangalore, is indeed the top-ranked Indian university in the World University Rankings 2025, as per the provided text.  

Pair 1 is incorrect.  While Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham is mentioned as a top-ranked Indian institution in the University Impact Rankings 2024, it is not the top-most ranked Indian institution in the QS World University Rankings 2025.  The text explicitly states that IIT Bombay holds that position. This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the specific ranking and its associated institution.

Pair 2 is also incorrect.  The text clearly indicates that Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham achieved the top rank among Indian universities in the University Impact Rankings 2024, not IIT Bombay.  This demonstrates the need to distinguish between different university ranking systems and their methodologies, which often produce varying results. The distractors are plausible because both institutions are highly ranked, but they are not in the positions indicated in the pairs.  A thorough understanding of the different ranking systems and their results is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. With reference to the National Health Accounts Estimates, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                       Change from 2020-21 to 2021-22
1. Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) : Increased
2. Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of THE      : Decreased
3. External/Donor Funding for health as a percentage of THE                   : Remained unchanged

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pair 2 accurately reflects the change in Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) as a percentage of Total Health Expenditure (THE) between 2020-21 and 2021-22. The provided text explicitly states that PHIE increased from 5.8% to 7.4% during this period.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health *decreased* as a percentage of THE, from 9.0% to 8.7%. This highlights a common misconception: automatically assuming an increase in government spending without considering the specific figures.

Pair 3 is also incorrect. The text shows a clear increase in External/Donor Funding for health as a percentage of THE, rising from 0.5% to 1.1%. This underscores the importance of carefully interpreting data and avoiding generalizations. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading data. A thorough understanding of the National Health Accounts Estimates and their components is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**3. With reference to the Foreign University Campuses in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Regulation/Policy                                  Feature
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 : Requires Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked in the global top 100.
2. National Education Policy 2020                   :  Explicitly discourages the entry of foreign universities into India.
3. Letter of Intent (LoI) issued to the University of Southampton : Represents the first international university to set up a campus in India under the 2023 regulations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 is correctly matched. The text explicitly states that the University of Southampton was the first international university to receive a Letter of Intent (LoI) to establish a campus in India under the UGC regulations of 2023.

Pair 1 is incorrect. The regulations do not require FHEIs to be ranked in the global top 100; instead, they specify that FHEIs must be ranked in the global top 500 or possess outstanding expertise in a particular area.  This serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precision in recalling details.

Pair 2 is incorrect because the National Education Policy 2020 actually *envisages* the entry of higher-ranked foreign universities to provide an international dimension to higher education in India. This is a significant distractor that tests the candidate's understanding of the policy's objectives.  The question requires a deep understanding of the nuances of educational policies and regulations.


**4. With reference to the Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC), consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Role/Characteristic
1. Food Security Information Network (FSIN)        :  Launches the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually.
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                    :   Not involved in the GNAFC's founding.
3. European Union                                 :  One of the founding members of the GNAFC.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The text clearly states that the Food Security Information Network (FSIN) produces the Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) annually and that the European Union is among the founding members of the GNAFC.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the World Food Programme (WFP) as one of the organizations that launched the GNAFC in 2016. This serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the founding members of the GNAFC. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations working on food security and their interrelationships.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings enhances the difficulty and discriminatory power of the question.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                     State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                            :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                                  :   Odisha
3. Kamars                                   :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                               :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Kamars are a Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Group (PVTG) found in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond are a PVTG found in Maharashtra.  The other pairings are incorrect. The Paudi Bhuyans are a PVTG found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  The Bharias are a PVTG located in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  This question tests factual recall regarding the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India.  Understanding the distribution of PVTGs is crucial for effective policymaking and targeted interventions for their socio-economic development.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as incorrectly pairing tribes with states where they are not found, increases the difficulty level of the question and necessitates precise knowledge.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to accurately match tribal groups with their respective states, demonstrating a grasp of India's diverse tribal demographics.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                    Key Feature
1. PM-JUGA                                 :   Focuses solely on the development of infrastructure in tribal areas
2. PMGKAY                                  :   Provides free food grains to 80 crore poor
3.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) indeed provides free food grains to 80 crore poor individuals, and the National Food Security Act, 2013, legally recognizes the right to food.  However, pair 1 is incorrect.  While PM-JUGA does involve infrastructure development, it is not its sole focus. The scheme's objective is broader, encompassing social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihood improvement through convergence and outreach.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes related to food security and tribal welfare in India.  It assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between the core objectives of different schemes and avoid generalizations.  The inclusion of an incorrect pairing (PM-JUGA) acts as a distractor, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge and avoid assumptions.  This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced aspects of government initiatives aimed at improving the lives of vulnerable populations in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Body                      Function/Mandate
1.  Coal Controller Organisation (CCO)     :   Recommends the distribution of tax revenues among the Centre and States
2.  Finance Commission                     :   Collects, compiles, and disseminates coal statistics
3.  World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) :  Leads the development of a balanced international IP system

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pair 3 is correctly matched. The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) indeed leads the development of a balanced international intellectual property system.  The other two pairs are mismatched. The Coal Controller Organisation (CCO) is responsible for collecting, compiling, and disseminating coal statistics, not the distribution of tax revenues, which is the function of the Finance Commission.  The Finance Commission does not deal with coal statistics; its primary role is to recommend the distribution of tax revenues. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the mandates of various governmental and international organizations. It necessitates precise knowledge of the functions of each body, avoiding generalizations or confusing their roles.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings acts as a distractor, highlighting the need for accurate factual recall. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between the functions of different organizations, demonstrating a good understanding of governance and regulatory frameworks.


**4. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                             Key Objective
1.  PAIR                                  :   To establish world-class research centers with substantial funding support
2.  MAHA                                  :   To support priority-driven, solution-focused research
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)      :   Pairing universities for mentorship in a hub-and-spoke model

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pair 2 is correctly matched. The Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA) under ANRF indeed aims to support priority-driven, solution-focused research in areas like EV mobility, advanced materials, etc.  Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  The Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation and Research (PAIR) initiative pairs universities for mentorship, not establishing research centers. The ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE) focuses on establishing world-class research centers, not on mentorship programs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific initiatives under the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF).  It requires precise knowledge of the objectives of each initiative and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding programs.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, necessitating a thorough understanding of ANRF's structure and goals. This question evaluates a candidate's understanding of India's efforts to promote research and innovation.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Indicator                                Value/Finding
1.  India's GHI score                      :   18.3 (moderate)
2.  Global GHI score                       :   27.3 (serious)
3.  Percentage of India's population suffering from undernourishment:  >18.7%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The global GHI score in 2024 is indeed reported as 27.3, falling under the "serious" category.  Pairs 1 and 3 are incorrect.  India's GHI score in 2024 is actually 27.3 (serious), not 18.3 (moderate).  The percentage of India's population suffering from undernourishment is 13.7%, not >18.7%. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the key findings of the Global Hunger Index 2024 report, specifically regarding India's performance and global trends.  It necessitates accurate recall of numerical data and the ability to interpret the severity of hunger levels. The incorrect pairings serve as plausible distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge of the data presented in the report.  The question evaluates the candidate's ability to interpret and recall key indicators and data related to global hunger and nutrition.  It highlights the importance of understanding global development challenges and the need for accurate data interpretation.


**1. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   **Amendment**                                      **Specific Detail**
1.  Defining a pandemic emergency               :   Includes exceeding national health system response capacity
2.  Establishing a financial mechanism          :   Prioritizes needs of developing countries
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities           :   Enhances coordination among nations
4.  Successor to International Sanitary Regulations :   Adopted in 1951


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, as highlighted in the provided text, focused on refining the definition of a pandemic emergency to explicitly include situations where the capacity of national health systems is overwhelmed.  This is accurately reflected in pair 1.  Pair 2 correctly states that a key amendment established a coordinating financial mechanism with a focus on assisting developing nations. Pair 3 accurately notes the creation of national IHR authorities to improve international coordination. However, pair 4 is incorrect.  The International Sanitary Regulations were adopted in 1951, but the IHR (2005) is its successor, not the other way around.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between accurate and subtly incorrect information, making it a challenging question for UPSC aspirants. The distractor in pair 4 is designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the historical context of the IHR.


**2. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   **Scheme Feature**                                  **Specific Aspect**
1.  Named after Birsa Munda                         :   Leader of the Ulgulan movement
2.  Objective                                        :   Convergence of existing schemes
3.  Funding Source                                   :   DAPST grants under Central Schemes
4.  Focus on FRA patta holders                       :   22 lakh holders targeted


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA scheme is indeed named after Birsa Munda, a tribal leader known for his resistance against the British and his leadership of the Ulgulan movement (pair 1).  The scheme's core objective is to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods through the convergence of already existing schemes (pair 2). Its funding is sourced from the Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes (pair 3). Finally, the scheme has a particular focus on reaching the 22 lakh Forest Rights Act (FRA) patta holders (pair 4). Thus, all four pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the scheme's details.  This question tests factual recall and understanding of the scheme's design and implementation.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   **Convention Aspect**                               **Specific Detail**
1.  Adoption Year                                     :   2008
2.  Objective                                         :   Full and equal enjoyment of human rights by persons with disabilities
3.  Number of Signatories (including India)          :   164
4.  Theme of 17th Conference of States Parties     :   Rethinking disability inclusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD's primary objective is indeed to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of human rights for all persons with disabilities, as stated in pair 2.  The convention has 164 signatories, including India (pair 3).  The 17th session of the Conference of States Parties did focus on "Rethinking disability inclusion" (pair 4). However, pair 1 is incorrect; while the convention was adopted in 2006, it entered into force in 2008.  The question requires precise knowledge of the convention's timeline and details, testing factual recall and attention to detail.  The incorrect pair acts as a strong distractor, emphasizing the importance of accuracy in recalling specific dates.


**4. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) Estimates for India, consider the following pairs:**

   **Health Indicator**                                 **Specific Data Point**
1.  Total Health Expenditure (THE) as % of GDP      :   Increased to 3.83% in 2021-22
2.  Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as % of THE:   Increased to 48% in 2021-22
3.  Current Health Expenditure (CHE) as % of THE   :   Decreased to 87.3% in 2021-22
4.  Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) as % of THE  :   Decreased to 39.4% in 2021-22


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The NHA estimates for India, as per the provided text, show that the Total Health Expenditure (THE) as a percentage of GDP did increase to 3.83% in 2021-22 (pair 1). Government Health Expenditure (GHE) as a percentage of THE increased to 48% (pair 2). Current Health Expenditure (CHE) as a percentage of THE decreased to 87.3% (pair 3). Finally, Out-of-Pocket Expenditure (OOPE) as a percentage of THE decreased to 39.4% (pair 4). All four pairs accurately reflect the data presented. This question assesses factual recall of specific numerical data points related to India's healthcare financing.  The inclusion of multiple numerical pairs increases the difficulty and reduces the likelihood of guessing the correct answer.



**5. With reference to the Food Waste Index Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   **Report Feature**                                  **Specific Detail**
1.  Tracks food waste at                               :   Retail and consumer levels
2.  Supports SDG indicator                           :   SDG 12.3.1 (b)
3.  Custodian of the Food Waste Index                :   UNEP
4.  Estimated global greenhouse gas emissions from food waste:   8-10%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Food Waste Index Report 2024, as detailed in the text, tracks food waste specifically at the retail and consumer levels (household and food service) (pair 1). It directly contributes to the achievement of SDG indicator 12.3.1 (b), focusing on halving per capita global food waste at the retail and consumer levels (pair 2).  The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI) (pair 3).  Finally, the report estimates that food waste contributes to 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions (pair 4).  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, showcasing a strong understanding of the report's scope and findings.  This question tests detailed factual recall and the ability to connect a report's findings to relevant Sustainable Development Goals.  The inclusion of the percentage figure adds another layer of difficulty.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                    Key Provision
1.  National Policy for PwDs, 2006           :   5% reservation in Government jobs for PwDs
2.  RPwD Act, 2016                             :   Right to free education for children with disabilities (6-18 years)
3.  Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992 :   Establishment of limited guardianship for PwDs
4.  Accessible India Campaign (2015)        :   Incentivizing private sector employers for PwD hiring

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Policy for PwDs, 2006, while encompassing various aspects of PwD welfare, notably included a provision for 5% reservation in government jobs.  The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 (RPwD Act), significantly broadened the rights of PwDs, including the right to free education for children aged 6 to 18 years. The Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, focuses on the regulation and standardization of rehabilitation professionals and services, not directly on establishing limited guardianship (though it indirectly supports the concept). The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) initiated in 2015 aimed to make public spaces accessible to PwDs, and while it doesn't directly mandate private sector incentives, government initiatives often indirectly encourage private sector participation in inclusive practices.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (c) is incorrect because the Rehabilitation Council of India Act, 1992, doesn't directly establish limited guardianship. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                       Specific Feature
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency                  :   Establishment of a States Parties Committee
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism:   Pandemic defined as communicable disease with wide geographical spread
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities             :   Successor to International Sanitary Regulations (1951)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The amendments to the IHR, 2005, included a crucial redefinition of a pandemic emergency, specifying that it involves a communicable disease with a "wide geographical spread" or a high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capabilities.  The establishment of a Coordinating Financial Mechanism was a key part of the amendments to address the needs of developing countries.  Creating National IHR Authorities was another crucial amendment to improve coordination, but it is not directly linked to defining a pandemic emergency. The IHR (2005) itself is the successor to the International Sanitary Regulations (1951), not a feature of a specific amendment. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the relationship between amendments and features or incorrectly include or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                     Primary Focus
1.  Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005   :   Raising the legal marriage age for women
2.  Beti Bachao Beti Padhao Scheme (2015)               :   Preventing child marriages
3.  Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015  :  Providing relief to victims of domestic violence
4.  Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016 :   Prohibition of child labour


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA), 2005, focuses on providing protection and redressal for women experiencing domestic abuse.  The Beti Bachao Beti Padhao scheme aims to improve the status of girls and women, including preventing child marriages. The Juvenile Justice Act, 2015, deals with the care and protection of children in conflict with the law and those in need of care and protection, thus indirectly addressing child marriages. The Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Amendment Act, 2016, explicitly prohibits child labour.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly pairs the PWDVA with raising the marriage age (which is a separate policy objective). Option (b) is also incorrect as it omits the relevant aspects of the Juvenile Justice Act. Option (c) is incomplete as it leaves out the correctly matched pair related to child labour.


**4. With reference to Higher Education in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Policy                                   Characteristic
1.  National Education Policy (NEP)                 :   Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
2.  UGC Draft Guidelines for RPL                      :   Multiple exit options from undergraduate degrees
3.  Academic Bank of Credit (ABC)                     :   Digital storage of academic credits
4.  Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEI)  :   Awarding degrees under the name and seal of the FHEI in the country of origin


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NEP advocates for RPL, but the specific guidelines are issued by the UGC. The UGC's draft guidelines for RPL are focused on formalizing the recognition of prior learning. The ABC is explicitly designed for the digital storage of academic credits earned from various institutions. FHEIs operating in India, under the NEP's framework, award degrees under the name and seal of their origin institution.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pairs related to ABC and FHEI. Option (c) is also incorrect, similarly omitting the RPL aspect. Option (d) is incorrect because NEP itself doesn't directly introduce multiple exit options; this is a feature implemented through subsequent guidelines and regulations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative          Key Feature/Objective
1.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 : Defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health emergencies crossing borders
2.  World Health Assembly (WHA)               : Appoints the Director-General of WHO
3.  System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011       : A global standard framework for producing health accounts, facilitating cross-country comparisons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Health Regulations (IHR) (2005) is a legally binding instrument that establishes a framework for countries to handle public health events that have the potential to cross borders.  This includes defining their responsibilities and rights during such emergencies. The World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the World Health Organization (WHO), has several functions, including appointing the Director-General.  The System of Health Accounts (SHA) 2011 is indeed a globally recognized framework designed to standardize the production of health accounts, allowing for meaningful comparisons of health expenditure and resource allocation across different nations.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                      Key Function/Characteristic
1.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Facilitates the entry of top 500 globally ranked universities
2.  National Health Accounts Estimates         : Prepared by the National Health Accounts Technical Secretariat (NHATS)
3.  National Family Health Survey-5 (NFHS) Report : Released by the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UGC regulations of 2023 aim to allow high-ranking foreign universities to establish campuses in India, aligning with the National Education Policy 2020's goals.  The National Health Accounts Estimates are indeed prepared by the NHATS.  Finally, the NFHS-5 reports are released by the MoHFW.  All three statements accurately reflect the functions and characteristics of the listed organizations and initiatives.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                   Key Provision/Feature
1.  Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) : Defines sexual harassment based on the Vishaka judgment
2.  Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016 : Mandates government programs to ensure adequate living standards for PwDs
3.  The Persons with Disabilities (Equal Opportunities, Protection of Rights and Full Participation) Act, 1995 :  Includes provisions for reservation in government jobs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act explicitly uses the Supreme Court's definition of sexual harassment as established in the Vishaka judgment. The RPwD Act, 2016, mandates government initiatives to ensure PwDs have adequate standards of living.  The 1995 Act included provisions for reservation in government employment for people with disabilities.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                    Producing/Publishing Organization
1.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
2.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)          : Produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
3.  Food Waste Index Report 2024                 : Launched by UN Environment Programme (UNEP) with WRAP


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report indeed focuses on the financing needed to eradicate hunger and malnutrition. The Global Report on Food Crises is annually published by the FSIN. And, the Food Waste Index Report 2024 was a joint effort of UNEP and WRAP.  All three pairings are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                 Key Feature/Objective
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Aims to improve socio-economic conditions of tribal communities
2.  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) :  Includes the Lakhpati Didi initiative
3.  Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) : Focuses on accessibility for persons with disabilities

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA explicitly aims at the socio-economic upliftment of tribal communities. DAY-NRLM is indeed linked to the Lakhpati Didi initiative which aims to empower women through self-help groups.  The Accessible India Campaign is focused on improving accessibility for people with disabilities.  All three pairs are correctly matched; therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                          Specific Detail
1.  Defining Pandemic Emergency                     :  Includes communicable diseases exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2.  Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism :  Aims to support only high-income countries during health crises.
3.  Creating National IHR Authorities               :  Improves international coordination during public health emergencies.
4.  States Parties Committee                         :  Focuses solely on developed nations' IHR implementation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The amendment defining a pandemic emergency correctly incorporates the aspect of exceeding national health system response capabilities, reflecting the challenges highlighted by events like the COVID-19 pandemic.  The establishment of National IHR Authorities directly aims to improve coordination among countries, a crucial element for effective global health security.

Option 2 is incorrect because the Coordinating Financial Mechanism is designed to address the needs of developing countries, not solely high-income ones.  The focus is on equitable resource allocation to enhance global preparedness and response. Option 4 is also incorrect as the States Parties Committee is intended to improve the overall implementation of the IHR, encompassing all member states, not just developed ones.  The committee’s role is to ensure effective collaboration and accountability in managing global health threats.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the details of the amendments.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of UN-CRPD                                         Specific Detail
1.  Year of Adoption                                      : 2008
2.  Objective                                              : To exclusively protect the rights of children with disabilities.
3.  Number of Signatories (including India)                : 164
4.  Definition of Persons with Disabilities                 :  Excludes individuals with temporary impairments.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD was indeed adopted in 2006 and entered into force in 2008, making statement 1 correct.  The convention has 164 signatories, including India, which makes statement 3 also correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the UN-CRPD's objective is broader than solely protecting children with disabilities.  It aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, regardless of age.  Statement 4 is incorrect as the definition of persons with disabilities under the UN-CRPD encompasses those with long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments, explicitly including those with long-term conditions.  Temporary impairments are generally not covered under this definition.


**3. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of PM-JUGA                                     Specific Detail
1.  Named after                                          :  Vallabhbhai Patel
2.  Objective                                              :  Focuses exclusively on improving healthcare infrastructure in tribal areas.
3.  Funding Source                                         :  Primarily from newly allocated funds.
4.  Based on learnings from                               :  PM-JANMAN


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PM-JUGA is indeed based on the learnings and successes of the PM-JANMAN (Pradhan Mantri Janjati Adivasi Nyaya Maha Abhiyan), making statement 4 correct.

Statement 1 is incorrect; PM-JUGA is named after Birsa Munda, not Vallabhbhai Patel.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the scheme's objective is broader than solely focusing on healthcare. It aims to address critical gaps in social infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the scheme uses existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants, not newly allocated funds.


**4. With reference to the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of POSH Act                                       Specific Detail
1.  Definition of Sexual Harassment                       :  Based on the Vishaka judgment.
2.  Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) Composition     :  Must include at least one male member.
3.  ICC Term                                               :  Unlimited
4.  Local Complaints Committee (LCC) Jurisdiction        :  Handles complaints only from the organized sector.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act correctly defines sexual harassment in line with the Supreme Court's definition in the Vishaka judgment, making statement 1 accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect; while the ICC must have at least two members from amongst employees, it does not mandate the inclusion of a male member.  At least half of the members must be women. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ICC has a maximum term of three years.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the LCC handles complaints from the unorganized sector or where an ICC has not been constituted or the complaint is against the employer.


**5. With reference to the National Health Accounts (NHA) estimates, consider the following pairs:**

   Expenditure Category                                    Percentage Change (2020-21 to 2021-22)
1.  Social Security Expenditure (SSE) on health          : Increased
2.  Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE)        : Decreased
3.  External/Donor Funding for health                   : Increased


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The NHA estimates show an increase in both Social Security Expenditure (SSE) and External/Donor Funding for health from 2020-21 to 2021-22, making statements 1 and 3 correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the Private Health Insurance Expenditures (PHIE) increased, not decreased, during the same period.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the changes in expenditure categories.


**6. With reference to Euthanasia and related guidelines, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                                  Specific Detail
1.  Type of Euthanasia primarily addressed in guidelines : Active Euthanasia
2.  Composition of Primary Medical Board (PMB)           :  At least 5 members
3.  Requirement for Living Will                            :  Attestation by a notary or gazetted officer is sufficient.
4.  Key Supreme Court Case                               :  M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

The guidelines primarily address passive euthanasia, not active euthanasia, making statement 1 incorrect.  The PMB consists of at least three members, not five, making statement 2 incorrect.  The attestation by a notary or gazetted officer is sufficient for a valid living will, making statement 3 correct.  The key Supreme Court case related to euthanasia is Common Cause vs. Union of India & Anr., not M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India, making statement 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF), consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                              Specific Detail
1.  PAIR (Partnerships for Accelerated Innovation...)     :  Pairs established institutions with universities lacking research infrastructure.
2.  MAHA (Mission for Advancement in High-impact...)   :  Focuses solely on basic research in fundamental sciences.
3.  ANRF Centre of Excellence (ACE)                     :  Receives minimal funding support.
4.  ANRF Act                                             :  Established in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

The PAIR initiative accurately pairs universities with nascent research capabilities with established institutions for mentorship, making statement 1 correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect; MAHA supports solution-focused research in priority areas, not solely basic research.  Statement 3 is incorrect; ACE centers receive substantial funding support.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the ANRF Act was established in 2023, not 2022.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                     State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                           :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Maria Gond                              :   Chhattisgarh
3. Bharias                                 :   Odisha
4. Kamars                                  :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only because the Maria Gond tribe is associated with Maharashtra.  The other options are incorrect due to mismatched pairings of tribes and states.  The Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  Bharias are primarily located in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha.  And the Kamars are primarily associated with Chhattisgarh, not Maharashtra. This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in India, a crucial aspect of understanding India's diverse tribal populations and their specific needs.  The distractors are carefully chosen to represent tribes and states that are geographically proximate, making the question challenging and requiring precise knowledge.


**2. With reference to PVTGs, consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs           Description
1. Forest-based livelihoods               :   Primarily engaged in agriculture
2. Pre-agricultural level of existence    :   Subsistence economy
3. Stagnant and declining population      :   Rapid population growth
4. Extremely low literacy                   :   High literacy rates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 correctly matches a criterion for identifying PVTGs with its accurate description.  PVTGs are characterized by a pre-agricultural level of existence, which is synonymous with a subsistence economy.  The other options present incorrect or contradictory descriptions.  Statement 1 incorrectly describes PVTGs' livelihoods as agricultural, when they are primarily forest-based. Statement 3 incorrectly describes the population as growing rapidly, when it's stagnant or declining. Statement 4 incorrectly attributes high literacy rates to PVTGs; they typically have extremely low literacy rates. This question tests the understanding of the criteria used to identify PVTGs, a key concept for analyzing the socio-economic vulnerabilities of these groups. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate descriptions of PVTGs characteristics.


**3. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                  State where Habitat Rights Granted
1. Juangs                                 :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Mankidia                               :   Chhattisgarh
3. Dongria Kondhs                         :   Maharashtra
4. Bharias                                 :   Odisha

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Habitat rights under the FRA have been granted to the Mankidia tribe in Odisha, and to the Bharias in Madhya Pradesh.  The other pairs are incorrect.  Juangs have received habitat rights in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  Dongria Kondhs have received habitat rights in Odisha, not Maharashtra.  This question tests the knowledge of specific tribal groups and the states where they have been granted habitat rights under the FRA.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings challenges the candidate's ability to recall specific details, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge in this area.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                       Focus Area
1. PM-JUGA                                     :   Urban development
2. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                  :   Rural housing
3. Skill India Mission                         :   Financial inclusion
4.  Ayushman Bharat Card                       :  Higher Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) focuses on providing rural housing.  The other options are incorrect.  PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) focuses on the socio-economic development of tribal communities, not urban development.  Skill India Mission focuses on skill development, not financial inclusion. Ayushman Bharat Card is a health insurance scheme, not related to higher education.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various government schemes and their respective focus areas.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of these schemes, requiring a nuanced understanding of their objectives and implementations.


**5. With reference to the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                   Ranking
1. Iceland                                    :   129th
2. India                                      :   1st
3. Norway                                     :   3rd
4. Bangladesh                              :   5th (in South Asia)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Norway is ranked 3rd in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024, and Bangladesh is ranked 5th in South Asia.  The other pairs are incorrect. Iceland is not ranked 129th, and India is not ranked 1st.  This question tests factual recall of country rankings in a specific report.  The distractors use countries that have featured prominently in global gender equality discussions, creating plausible but ultimately incorrect options.  The question highlights the importance of precise knowledge rather than general understanding.


**6. With reference to the  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                     Description
1. Adoption Year                              :   2008
2. Location of Adoption                       :   Paris, France
3.  Harmonization of anti-doping legislation :  Not applicable to India
4.  India's Status                             :   Signed but not ratified


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport was adopted in Paris, France.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The convention was adopted in 2005, not 2008.  The convention explicitly aims at harmonizing anti-doping legislation internationally, including India. India has both signed and ratified the convention. This question tests specific details related to an international convention.  The distractors include plausible but incorrect years, locations, and descriptions of the convention's applicability and India's status, requiring precise knowledge to answer correctly.



**7. With reference to the Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment                                Description
1. Defining Pandemic Emergency           :  Focuses on domestic health systems only
2. Establishing Coordinating Financial Mechanism :  Exclusively benefits developed nations
3.  Establishing States Parties Committee  :  Improves coordination among countries
4. Creating National IHR Authorities     :   Focuses solely on disease prevention


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The amendment establishing a States Parties Committee directly aims at improving coordination among countries.  The other options present incorrect or incomplete descriptions.  The definition of pandemic emergency considers wide geographical spread and the capacity of national health systems. The coordinating financial mechanism is designed to help developing countries, not exclusively developed ones.  The creation of National IHR Authorities aims to improve overall preparedness and response, not just disease prevention. This question tests detailed understanding of specific amendments to the IHR.  The distractors offer incomplete or misleading descriptions of the amendments, demanding precise knowledge to identify the only fully accurate pairing.



**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report                                      Key Finding
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024           :   134 years to reach full gender parity
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022       :   India ranked 1st
3. Human Development Report 2023/2024     :   Released by the World Economic Forum
4. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)          :   Measures gender parity across 14 indicators


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 projected that it would take 134 years to reach full gender parity.  The GGGI (Global Gender Gap Index) does measure gender parity across 14 indicators.  The other pairs are incorrect.  The GII 2022 did not rank India first; the Human Development Report 2023/2024 was not released by the World Economic Forum.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific reports and their key findings.  The distractors use closely related reports and findings, demanding precise knowledge to correctly match the pairs.  The question emphasizes the importance of accurate recall of data points from specific reports.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                      State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                     :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Kamars                           :   Chhattisgarh
3. Maria Gond                        :   Odisha
4. Bharias                           :   Maharashtra

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairing of Kamars with Chhattisgarh is correct.  The Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  The Maria Gond tribe primarily inhabits Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra, not Odisha.  The Bharias are a tribal group primarily located in Madhya Pradesh, not Maharashtra. This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups within India. The distractors are designed to be plausible, as the listed tribes are all indeed found in India, but the specific state pairings are manipulated to challenge knowledge.  Understanding the precise locations of these vulnerable groups is crucial for effective policy implementation and targeted development initiatives.  The incorrect options highlight the importance of accurate information when dealing with sensitive demographic data related to tribal populations and their specific needs.


**2. With reference to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs), consider the following pairs:**

   Criterion for Identifying PVTGs        Description
1.  Forest-based livelihoods             :   Predominantly urban dwelling
2.  Pre-agricultural level of existence   :   Highly developed agricultural practices
3.  Stagnant and declining population    :   Rapid population growth
4.  Extremely low literacy                 :   High literacy rates

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) None
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The criteria for identifying PVTGs are the opposite of what is described in the pairs.  PVTGs are characterized by forest-based livelihoods, a pre-agricultural level of existence, a stagnant or declining population, and extremely low literacy rates.  The provided descriptions in the question are deliberately designed to be incorrect, serving as strong distractors to test the candidate's understanding of the characteristics defining PVTGs.  A thorough understanding of the socioeconomic and demographic markers of PVTGs is essential for designing effective policy interventions aimed at their upliftment and empowerment.  The incorrect options highlight the potential pitfalls of relying on inaccurate or incomplete information when addressing the challenges faced by vulnerable tribal communities.


**3. With reference to the 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of the Scheme                 Feature
1.  Scheme Type                        :   State-sponsored scheme
2.  Funding Mechanism                  :   100% State assistance
3.  Implementation Approach            :   Macro-level planning

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The scheme is centrally sponsored, not state-sponsored, with 100% central assistance, not state assistance. The scheme utilizes a micro-plan approach (Conservation cum Development plans) rather than a macro-level planning approach.  These incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the scheme's structure and implementation.  The incorrect options highlight the necessity for a precise understanding of the funding mechanisms and implementation strategies of government schemes. This is crucial for evaluating their effectiveness and identifying potential areas for improvement in reaching the intended beneficiaries.  The depth of knowledge required to answer this question correctly demonstrates a higher level of understanding beyond superficial knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Nomadic/Semi-Nomadic Tribe Type      Example Tribe
1. Hunter/trappers of birds and animals :   Banjaras
2. Pastoral communities                 :   Konda Reddis
3. Peripatetic groups of peddlers       :   Gujjars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Banjaras are primarily pastoral communities, not hunters/trappers. Konda Reddis are hunter-gatherers, not pastoralists. Gujjars are pastoral communities, not peripatetic peddlers. The incorrect pairings effectively challenge the candidate's understanding of the diverse lifestyles and economic activities of nomadic and semi-nomadic tribes in India. This question tests the ability to differentiate between the various categories of nomadic groups and their characteristic occupations.  The incorrect options serve as strong distractors, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of the classifications and examples of these diverse communities.  Understanding these distinctions is vital for crafting targeted policies and development programs that address the specific needs of each group.


**5. With reference to Denotified Tribes (DNTs), consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                  Correctness
1.  All nomadic tribes are DNTs              :   True
2.  All DNTs are nomadic tribes              :   True
3.  The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1952 :   True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  While some DNTs are nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are DNTs.  Conversely, not all DNTs are nomadic; many have settled lifestyles. The Criminal Tribes Act was repealed in 1949, not 1952. The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuanced relationship between DNTs, nomadic tribes, and the historical context of the Criminal Tribes Act. The question tests knowledge of the historical context, the legal status, and the social characteristics of DNTs.  The incorrect options highlight the risk of making generalizations about complex social groups and the importance of nuanced understanding of historical legislation and its impact.  This demonstrates a deeper understanding of the subject matter.


**6. With reference to the Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), consider the following pairs:**

   Goal of PM-JUGA                                 Specific Intervention
1. Developing Enabling Infrastructure              :   Tribal Home Stays
2. Promotion of Economic Empowerment           :   Improving infrastructure of Government residential Schools/Hostels
3. Universalization of Access to Education      :   Providing access to training under Skill India Mission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Tribal Home Stays are an intervention under the goal of developing infrastructure; providing Skill India Mission training directly contributes to economic empowerment. However, improving the infrastructure of government residential schools/hostels, while related to education, isn't a direct intervention to universalize access to education in the same way skill development is to economic empowerment. This question tests the ability to link specific interventions to the broader goals of the PM-JUGA scheme.  The incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between direct and indirect interventions towards specific goals.  Understanding this nuance is crucial for evaluating the scheme's impact and identifying potential areas for improvement in achieving its objectives.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Global Ranking System                    Key Feature
1. Times Higher Education World University Rankings:   Based on 9 performance indicators
2. QS World University Rankings              :   Assesses universities across UN SDGs
3. University Impact Rankings                 :   Includes 18 indicators across five key areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Times Higher Education World University Rankings use 18 indicators across five key areas, not 9.  The QS World University Rankings do not assess universities based on UN SDGs; that's the focus of the University Impact Rankings.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of the specific methodologies employed by different global university ranking systems.  This is important for understanding the strengths and limitations of each system and for interpreting their results accurately.  The detailed knowledge required to answer this question correctly demonstrates a higher level of understanding than superficial familiarity with the names of ranking systems.


**8. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF), consider the following pairs:**

    NIRF Aspect                      Feature
1.  Year of Launch                 :   2020
2.  Implementing Agency           :   Ministry of Education
3.  Number of Parameters            :   Four

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. NIRF was launched in 2015, not 2020. The implementing agency is the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) in collaboration with INFLIBNET Centre, not solely the Ministry of Education. NIRF uses five parameters, not four. The incorrect pairings effectively serve as distractors, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the NIRF framework, its history, and its operational aspects. This level of detail is important for critically evaluating the ranking system and its implications for higher education in India. The depth of knowledge required to answer this question showcases a strong understanding of the intricacies of the NIRF framework.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                          Purpose
1.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   To establish a Supreme Court in Calcutta.
2.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006           :   To grant habitat rights to PVTGs.
3.  National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013 :   To regulate live-in relationships.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The UGC regulations aim to facilitate the establishment of foreign university campuses in India. The FRA grants forest rights, including habitat rights, to certain tribal groups.  The NFSA deals with food security, not live-in relationships. The incorrect pairing serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to link specific acts and regulations with their respective purposes.  A precise understanding of the scope and objectives of various legislative instruments is crucial for analyzing policy interventions and their impacts on society.  The depth of knowledge required to answer this question demonstrates a higher level of understanding than superficial awareness of the names of acts and regulations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                      Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2.  Project PARI                           : Ministry of Women & Child Development
3.  NIPUN Bharat Mission                 : Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship
4.  Smart Cities Mission                  : Ministry of Rural Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is indeed an initiative under the Ministry of Tribal Affairs aimed at improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  Option 1 is correctly matched.

Option 2 is incorrect. Project PARI (Public Art of India) is an initiative of the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of Women & Child Development.  The Ministry of Culture's role in promoting arts and cultural heritage aligns with Project PARI's focus on public art.

Option 3 is incorrect. The NIPUN Bharat Mission, focused on foundational literacy and numeracy, is under the Ministry of Education, not the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship. While skill development is indirectly related, the primary focus of NIPUN Bharat is foundational learning.

Option 4 is incorrect.  The Smart Cities Mission is an initiative of the Union Housing and Urban Affairs Ministry, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The mission's goal of developing urban infrastructure and improving the quality of life in cities falls under the purview of urban development.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                         Key Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 :  Provides habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)
2. Telecommunications Act, 2023          : Establishes the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
3.  International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 : Defines countries’ rights and obligations in handling public health events
4. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871              : Currently in force and used to classify communities as "born criminals"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, does indeed grant habitat rights to PVTGs, making statement 1 correct.  The International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, establish a framework for countries to manage cross-border public health emergencies, making statement 3 correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, established the Digital Bharat Nidhi, which *replaced* the erstwhile Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).  The USOF was not established by this act.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 was repealed. It is not currently in force and is infamous for its discriminatory classification of communities.  The statement misrepresents the current legal status.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Program/Initiative                    Primary Goal
1.  SEHER Program                       :  Urban Planning
2.  Asmita Project                       : To produce high-quality study materials in native languages
3.  KIRTI Program                        : To streamline the entire process of grassroots talent identification
4.  Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana :  Relates to Skill Development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Asmita Project focuses on creating high-quality educational materials in local languages, aligning with option 2. The KIRTI Program aims to identify young sporting talent efficiently, matching option 3.  The Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana is a skill development initiative, thus option 4 is correct.

Option 1 is incorrect. The SEHER Program is primarily focused on financial literacy for women entrepreneurs, not urban planning.  While urban planning might indirectly benefit from women's economic empowerment, it isn't the program's central objective.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Agency               Role/Function
1.  Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty :  Eradicate hunger and poverty, reducing inequalities
2.  GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition) : Tackles malnutrition by supporting public-private partnerships
3.  Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) : Custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI)
4.  UN Environment Programme (UNEP) :  Custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty aims to achieve SDGs 1 and 2 and reduce inequalities (SDG 10), as stated in option 1. GAIN works to improve nutrition through public-private partnerships, as stated in option 2. FAO is the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI), making option 3 correct. UNEP is the custodian of the Food Waste Index (FWI), aligning with option 4.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Report/Index                          Key Focus/Agency
1.  State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 : Financing to end hunger and malnutrition
2.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) : Produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)
3.  Food Waste Index Report 2024          : Tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels
4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment :  Launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024, focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition. The Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC) is indeed produced by the FSIN. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels. The NQAS assessment is launched for AAMs and IPHLs.  Therefore, there are no mismatches in the given pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Ministry/Organization
1. Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) : Ministry of Rural Development
2.  National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat Mission: Ministry of Women and Child Development
3.  Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
4.  Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana: Ministry of Education

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is indeed implemented using funds from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST), which falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs.  Option 1 is therefore incorrect. The NIPUN Bharat Mission is correctly linked to the Ministry of Education, focusing on foundational literacy and numeracy.  Option 2 is correct. The Deendayal Antodaya Yojana – National Rural Livelihoods Mission (DAY-NRLM) is accurately associated with the Union Ministry of Rural Development, empowering women through self-help groups. Option 3 is incorrect. The Mukhyamantri Yuva Karya Prashikshan Yojana, a Maharashtra state initiative, is not directly linked to a central ministry. However, given the focus on youth skilling, it aligns more closely with the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, or possibly the Ministry of Education, making option 4 partially correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Key Feature/Objective

2.  Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission                      :  Provide universal health coverage
3.  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in Higher Education:  Integrate informal learning into the formal education system
4.  Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI)     :  Establish 14,500 schools overseen by the Central Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) is accurately described by its objective to provide all-weather road connectivity to eligible unconnected rural habitations. Option 1 is correct. The Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission aims to create a digital health ecosystem, simplifying processes and improving access to health records, not providing universal health coverage directly. Option 2 is incorrect. Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education indeed aims to integrate informal and non-formal learning into the formal system through assessments and certifications. Option 3 is correct. The Pradhan Mantri Schools for Rising India (PM SHRI) scheme correctly targets the establishment of over 14,500 schools under the central government's supervision. Option 4 is correct. Therefore, only options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Government Scheme/Initiative                 Funding Source
1.  Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) :  State-level budgets

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is funded from existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes, not state-level budgets. Option 1 is incorrect. The Lakhpati Didi Initiative correctly utilizes the Revolving Fund (RF) and Community Investment Fund (CIF) for financial assistance to self-help groups. Option 2 is correct.  The Accessible India Campaign (Sugamya Bharat Abhiyan) receives funding from the government, not solely from international development agencies. Option 3 is incorrect. The NIPUN Bharat Mission is a government initiative; its funding doesn't primarily rely on private donations. Option 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution                  Key Initiative/Program
1.  University Grants Commission (UGC)        :  Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL)
2.  Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF):  Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA)

**Explanation:**

The UGC is indeed responsible for issuing draft guidelines for the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) in higher education. Option 1 is correct.  The Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF) accurately launched the Mission for Advancement in High-impact Areas (MAHA). Option 2 is correct. The Bharatiya Bhasha Samiti (BBS) is correctly linked to the Asmita Project, focused on multilingual study materials. Option 3 is correct. The Ministry of Women and Child Development is accurately associated with the launch of Aadharshila, a National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE). Option 4 is correct. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Initiative/Convention               Key Feature/Objective
1.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD):  Promote barrier-free society
2.  Incheon Strategy “To make the Right Real” for Persons with Disabilities: Focuses on Asia-Pacific Region
3.  Biwako Millennium Framework:  Adopted in New York in 2006

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) accurately aims to promote, protect, and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms by all persons with disabilities, including working towards an inclusive, barrier-free society. Option 1 is correct. The Incheon Strategy correctly focuses on making the rights of persons with disabilities real, specifically in the Asia-Pacific region. Option 2 is correct. The Biwako Millennium Framework is not adopted in New York in 2006. The UNCRPD was adopted in 2006. Option 3 is incorrect.  The Global Hunger Index (GHI) is correctly released by Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. Option 4 is correct.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Policy/Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. NSP 2024                                          :   Focuses solely on achieving global sporting excellence.
2. Khelo India Scheme                               :   Aims to improve infrastructure for elite athletes only.
3. Target Olympic Podium Scheme (TOPS)           :   Exclusively supports athletes in non-Olympic sports.
4. Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024         :   Vision of "Sports for Nation Building"

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched.  The Draft National Sports Policy (NSP) 2024 indeed has the vision of "Sports for Nation Building – Harness the Power of Sports for Nation's Holistic Development".  Options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. The NSP 2024 is far broader than solely focusing on global sporting excellence; it encompasses social and economic development aspects.  The Khelo India Scheme is not limited to elite athletes; it aims at grassroots development and talent identification across various levels.  TOPS is not restricted to non-Olympic sports; it supports athletes targeting Olympic and Paralympic medals.  These incorrect options present plausible distractors by slightly altering the actual features of the schemes, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the policies. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to distinguish between the core aims and peripheral aspects of each initiative.

4. University Impact Rankings 2024              :   India was the least represented country.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correctly matched.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 indeed placed IIT Bombay as the highest-ranked Indian institution.  Option 1 is incorrect; NIRF is a national ranking, not a global ranking, and it did not rank Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham as the top Indian university globally.  Option 3 is incorrect; while IISc Bangalore was ranked in the 251-300 bracket according to THE rankings, not in 401-500 bracket. Option 4 is incorrect; India was the *most*, not least, represented country in the University Impact Rankings 2024.  The question tests factual recall and requires precise knowledge of different ranking systems and their results.  The incorrect options include plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between various ranking agencies and their methodologies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. ANRF did indeed subsume the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).  Statement 1 is incorrect; PAIR aims at accelerating innovation and research, not exclusively fundamental research.  Statement 2 is incorrect; MAHA supports solution-focused research across various priority areas, including science and technology, not just humanities. Statement 3 is incorrect; ACE receives substantial funding, including from private sources. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between various initiatives under ANRF.  The incorrect options present plausible but incorrect descriptions, testing the candidate's detailed understanding of the ANRF's goals and programs.


**4. With reference to  the  UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                   Feature

4. Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985  :   Deals exclusively with doping in sports


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correctly matched. The NADA's #PlayTrue Campaign was indeed conducted to commemorate WADA's Play True Day. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Convention was adopted in 2005, not 2006. Statement 3 is incorrect; WADA's 2022 data showed India had the *highest*, not lowest, percentage of doping offenders. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985, is a broader legislation, not solely focused on doping in sports. This question tests factual recall and understanding of anti-doping mechanisms. The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge of the relevant organizations and their activities.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills, demanding precise knowledge of the organizations and their roles.


**5.  Considering initiatives related to multilingualism in education and tribal welfare, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                             Feature

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Asmita Project aims to produce 22,000 books in 22 scheduled languages over 5 years, not 2 years.  The Bahubhasha Shabdkosh is a multilingual, not monolingual, dictionary repository. PM-JUGA is indeed based on learnings from PM-JANMAN.  Real-time Translation Architecture aims to enhance translation using cutting-edge technology, not outdated technology. The question tests factual knowledge of government initiatives and their features.  The incorrect options use close but inaccurate descriptions, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the programs.

3.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024  :   Includes rankings for Skill Universities
4.  Foreign University Campuses in India  :   Requires Foreign Higher Educational Institutions (FHEIs) to be ranked in the global top 200


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

NEP 2020 allows for both 3-year and 4-year undergraduate degrees. RPL aims to *integrate* informal learning into the formal system.  NIRF 2024 did indeed include rankings for Skill Universities. The criteria for foreign university campuses is that FHEIs must be ranked within the global top 500.  Only statement 3 is entirely correct, making (a) the correct option.  This question assesses factual recall regarding recent changes and policies in Indian higher education.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program                  Focus Area
1.  Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA)  :   Improving the socio-economic conditions of urban poor communities
2.  National Curriculum for Early Childhood Care and Education (Aadharshila) :   Focuses exclusively on digital literacy
3.  Project NAMAN                               :   Provides support to families of defence personnel
4.  Draft National Sports Policy (NSP), 2024    :   Prioritizes only elite athletes' training


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

PM-JUGA focuses on tribal communities, not urban poor. Aadharshila is a comprehensive early childhood curriculum, not solely focused on digital literacy. Project NAMAN indeed supports defence pensioners and their families.  The Draft National Sports Policy aims for holistic development, not just elite athletes. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. This question tests understanding of various government schemes and their objectives, requiring careful attention to detail.


**4. With reference to  international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Characteristic/Action
1.  World Health Assembly (WHA)             :   Amends the International Health Regulations (IHR) 2005
2.  Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC)     :   Regulates international monetary policy
3.  International Maritime Organization (IMO) :   Established in 1968
4.  Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG)           :   India is not a member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only



**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The WHA does indeed amend the IHR. The CAC is related to food safety standards, not monetary policy. The IMO was established in 1958, not 1968. India *is* a member of the NSG. Only the first pair is entirely accurate. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their functions, again requiring precise recall.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

     Term/Concept                              Description/Association

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

DNTs are indeed associated with the Habitual Offenders Act. Vimukta Jatis Day is celebrated on August 31st, not 30th. The 'Play True' campaign is associated with WADA (World Anti-Doping Agency), not the IOC. The NRF was indeed subsumed into ANRF.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  This tests knowledge of social groups and terminology related to sports and research policy.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Ranking                                   Top Ranked Indian Institution

The provided pairs correctly match the top-ranked Indian institutions according to their respective global university rankings.  The QS World University Rankings 2025 lists IIT Bombay as the highest-ranked Indian institution.  The Times Higher Education (THE) University Impact Rankings 2024 places Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham at the top among Indian universities.  Finally, the THE World University Rankings 2025 ranks IISc Bangalore as the top-performing Indian university.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the nuances of different ranking methodologies and their impact on institutional comparisons is crucial for comprehending the global higher education landscape.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to match institutions with their corresponding rankings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Regulation                                 Key Feature
1. UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :   Allows only top 500 global universities to establish campuses in India.
2. ANRF Act 2023                               :   Subsumed the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB).
3. National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013     :   Recognizes the right to food as a fundamental right.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023, indeed prioritize foreign universities ranked within the top 500 globally or those with outstanding expertise in specific fields for establishing campuses in India.  The ANRF Act 2023 did subsume the Science and Engineering Research Board (SERB), integrating its functions into the newly established Anusandhan National Research Foundation (ANRF). However, the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013, recognizes the right to food as a *statutory* right, not a fundamental right. Fundamental rights are enshrined in Part III of the Indian Constitution, while the NFSA is a legislative act.  This distinction makes option (c) and (d) incorrect. Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair involving the ANRF Act.  The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to distinguish between statutory and fundamental rights, demonstrating conceptual understanding.


**3. With reference to Global Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                      Key Objective

2. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty      :   To support and accelerate efforts to eradicate hunger and poverty.
3. Rome Declaration on Nutrition                    :   To commit countries to eradicate hunger and malnutrition.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Alliance for Global Good focuses on gender equity and equality, not on eradicating hunger and poverty. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty directly aims at achieving SDGs 1 and 2 (No Poverty and Zero Hunger), and reducing inequalities (SDG 10). The Rome Declaration on Nutrition commits countries to eradicating hunger and preventing all forms of malnutrition. Thus, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude the correctly matched pairs 2 and 3.  This question assesses the ability to correctly identify the objectives of different global initiatives, showcasing conceptual understanding and factual recall.  It also highlights the interconnectedness of various global development goals.


**4. With reference to International Organizations, consider the following pairs:**

The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) is located in Washington, D.C., USA. All three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests factual recall of the headquarters locations of significant international organizations. The accurate identification of these locations is essential for understanding the global governance structure and the geographical distribution of international agencies.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                      Key Provision/Focus
1. Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013 (POSH Act) :   Establishes Internal Complaints Committees (ICCs) in workplaces with 10 or more employees.
2. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) :   Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).
3. Amendments to International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005 :   Defines pandemic emergencies based on geographical spread and national health system capacity.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The POSH Act mandates the establishment of ICCs in workplaces with 10 or more employees to address sexual harassment complaints.  The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly grants habitat rights to PVTGs. The amendments to the IHR, 2005, introduced a clearer definition of pandemic emergencies, considering both geographical spread and the capacity of national health systems to respond effectively.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall related to specific legislation and their key provisions, demonstrating knowledge of Indian laws and international health regulations.  The question also touches upon social justice issues (POSH Act and FRA) and global health security (IHR amendments).

Iceland consistently ranks high, often achieving the top position, reflecting its strong commitment to gender equality.  Norway and Finland are also consistently among the top-ranked countries in the Global Gender Gap Index.  The 2024 report shows Iceland in the top position. The India's ranking in the Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is 129th.  The Gender Inequality Index (GII), published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), measures gender inequalities across different dimensions, including reproductive health, empowerment, and economic opportunity. Denmark and Norway frequently feature among the top-ranked countries in the GII. The 2022 report placed India at 108. Bhutan is correctly listed as a South Asian country that outperforms India in the Global Gender Gap Report, 2024. Thus, all pairs are correctly matched.

**Explanation:**

The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA) is correctly identified as aiming to uplift the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  The Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan is accurately named after Birsa Munda. Habitat rights are correctly associated with the protection of PVTGs under the Forest Rights Act, 2006. The Tribal Home Stay initiative is correctly linked to the Swadesh Darshan scheme's efforts to leverage tourism potential. The Vulnerability Reduction Fund (VRF) accurately addresses the various vulnerabilities affecting tribal households and communities. Therefore, option (d) is correct because all the pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                     Key Feature/Focus
1. PM-JUGA                                              :   Focuses on saturation of critical gaps in social infrastructure for tribal communities.
2.  Lakhpati Didi Initiative                             :   Aims to enable three crore SHG members to achieve an annual household income of ₹1 lakh or more.
3.  National Health Mission (NHM) Mobile Medical Units:   Provides immunization coverage in areas where sub-centers are distant.
4.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme:   Aims for comprehensive socio-economic development of PVTGs while preserving their culture.
5.  Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) NQAS Assessment :   Launched for real-time monitoring of public health facilities, complying with Indian Public Health Standards (IPHS).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) explicitly aims to address critical infrastructure gaps in tribal areas, aligning perfectly with statement 1. The Lakhpati Didi Initiative, a component of DAY-NRLM, is designed to boost the income of SHG women members to at least ₹1 lakh annually, as stated in statement 2.  The National Health Mission utilizes Mobile Medical Units to extend healthcare services, including immunization, to remote areas where access to sub-centers is limited, thereby validating statement 3. Statement 4 accurately reflects the objective of the PVTG development scheme, focusing on holistic socio-economic upliftment while respecting cultural heritage.  Finally, the NQAS assessment for AAMs is indeed implemented under the IPHS framework for digital monitoring of public health facilities, confirming statement 5.  Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) present accurate and precise linkages.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                           State/Region with Significant Presence
1. Juang                                             :   Madhya Pradesh
2.  Bharias                                            :   Odisha
3.  Kamars                                             :   Chhattisgarh
4.  Maria Gond                                        :   Maharashtra
5.  Dongria Kondhs                                    :   Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Kamars are indeed a tribal group with a significant presence in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond are found in Maharashtra. The other pairings are incorrect.  The Juang tribe is primarily located in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh.  The Bharias are primarily found in Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. The Dongria Kondhs reside in Odisha, not Gujarat. Therefore, option (b) is the only one that accurately reflects the geographical distribution of these specific tribal groups.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair, making them incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006:   Provides habitat rights to PVTGs.
2. Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024     :   Prohibits surrogacy with donor gametes.
3. Assisted Reproductive Technology (Regulation) Act, 2021:   Establishes a National Assisted Reproductive Technology and Surrogacy Board (NARTSB).
4. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         :   Designated certain communities as "born criminals."
5.  Forest Rights Act (FRA)                          :  Defines 'habitat' as area comprising customary habitat and other habitats in reserved and protected forests.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Four of the pairs are correctly matched. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly provides habitat rights to certain tribal groups, including PVTGs. The Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024,  *previously* prohibited surrogacy with donor gametes, but this was later amended to allow it under certain conditions. The ART Act of 2021 established the NARTSB. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is infamous for its discriminatory labeling of certain communities. The FRA explicitly defines habitat.  Only the statement regarding the Surrogacy Amendment Rules is factually incorrect in its original form, as it has been amended to allow surrogacy with donor gametes under certain medical conditions.  Therefore, four pairs are correctly matched in their original form; option (d) is correct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Index/Report                                         Key Indicator/Focus
1. Food Waste Index Report 2024                        :   Tracks global and national food waste at retail and consumer levels.
2. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                      :   Benchmarks gender parity across four dimensions (Health and Survival, Educational Attainment, Economic Participation and Opportunity, and Political Empowerment).
3. Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI)                      :  Measures gender inequality across 146 countries.
4. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022                   :   Ranges from 0 (equality) to 1 (maximum inequality), measuring gender disparities.
5.  United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Human Development Report 2023/2024: Focuses on breaking the gridlock and reimagining cooperation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Food Waste Index Report focuses on quantifying food waste across different stages. The Global Gender Gap Report assesses gender equality across various dimensions. The GGGI is a key metric used in the Global Gender Gap Report for benchmarking across countries. The GII measures gender inequality using a specific scale. The UNDP Human Development Report 2023/2024 indeed has the stated theme. Therefore, all five pairs represent accurate and precise relationships between the index/report and their core focus areas.  The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Program                  Targeted Beneficiary Group
1. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                    :   Urban poor households
2.  PM Gram Sadak Yojana                         :   Scheduled Tribe majority villages
3.  Skill India Mission                           :   Scheduled Castes only
4.  Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan                     :   Out-of-school children exclusively
5.  Poshan Abhiyan                              :  Malnourished children and pregnant women


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. PM Gram Sadak Yojana specifically targets villages with a majority Scheduled Tribe population for improved road connectivity. Poshan Abhiyan focuses on improving nutritional status among malnourished children and pregnant women. The other options are incorrect. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) targets rural, not urban, poor households. Skill India Mission is not exclusively for Scheduled Castes, it has a broader reach. Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan aims to improve the quality of education at all levels, not just for out-of-school children. Therefore, only options 2 and 5 provide accurate targeting information for these government schemes.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Focus Area
1. PM-JUGA                               :  Sustainable Livelihoods for Forest Right Holders
2. Aadharshila                            :  Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) for Children aged 3-6
3. SPARSH                                :  Digital Pension System for Defence Pensioners
4. National Medical Register (NMR) Portal:  Database for allopathic doctors in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) explicitly focuses on improving the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities, including sustainable livelihoods for those holding Forest Rights.  Aadharshila is a national curriculum specifically designed for early childhood care and education for children aged 3-6 years. SPARSH is a digital pension system streamlining processes for defence pensioners. Finally, the National Medical Register (NMR) portal serves as a comprehensive database for all registered allopathic doctors in India.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings; each accurately reflects the primary focus of the named scheme or initiative.  The options provided are designed to test the candidate's comprehensive understanding of these government schemes and their specific aims.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe/Community                      Characteristic/Location
1. Juangs                               :  Keonjhar District, Odisha
2. Denotified Tribes (DNTs)             :  Categorized as 'born criminals' under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871
3. Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) :  Highest concentration in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh (2001 Census)
4. Nomadic Tribes                         :  Always included in the DNTs category

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Juangs are indeed a tribal group residing in Keonjhar district, Odisha.  The Denotified Tribes (DNTs) were historically labelled as "born criminals" under the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, a discriminatory practice.  The 2001 Census data shows a high concentration of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) in Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While many DNTs are nomadic, not all nomadic tribes are classified as DNTs.  This crucial distinction makes option (d) incorrect. Options (b) and (c) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, highlighting the candidate's understanding of the historical context and demographic distribution of various tribal groups in India.


**3. With reference to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Amendment Rules, 2024, consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment                                   Specific Provision
1.  Allowed surrogacy with donor gametes   :  Requires District Medical Board certification of medical necessity
2.  Allowed surrogacy for single women      :  Mandates use of self-eggs and donor sperm
3.  Prohibition of commercial surrogacy     :  Maintained from the Surrogacy (Regulation) Act, 2021

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 amendments to the Surrogacy (Regulation) Rules introduced significant changes.  Surrogacy involving donor gametes (egg or sperm) is now permitted, but only with a District Medical Board's certification confirming the medical necessity.  Single women (widows or divorcees) can now utilize surrogacy, but are required to use their own eggs and donor sperm.  The ban on commercial surrogacy, a key provision of the 2021 Act, remains in effect. All three pairs accurately reflect the provisions of the 2024 amendments. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, failing to encompass the full range of changes introduced.  Option (d) correctly identifies all the matched pairs, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the updated surrogacy regulations in India.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                      Key Provision/Feature
1.  Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006       :  Defines 'habitat' for Primitive Tribal Groups
2.  National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019:  Mandates the creation of a National Medical Register
3.  Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971:  Includes marital rape as grounds for abortion (as per 2022 SC ruling)
4.  Habitual Offenders Act                :   Categorizes individuals convicted of multiple crimes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, explicitly defines "habitat" for the benefit of Primitive Tribal Groups and other forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes.  The National Medical Commission (NMC) Act, 2019, mandates the creation and maintenance of a National Medical Register.  A 2022 Supreme Court ruling interpreted the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971, to include marital rape as grounds for abortion.  The Habitual Offenders Act, implemented at the state level, indeed categorizes individuals with multiple criminal convictions.  All four pairs are correctly matched, showcasing knowledge of various legislation and their key features. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete, leaving out at least one correctly matched pair.  Selecting (d) indicates a thorough understanding of the legal frameworks mentioned.


**5. With reference to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD), consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Provision                 Description
1.  Full and equal enjoyment of human rights:  Core objective of the UN-CRPD
2.  Biwako Millennium Framework       :  Supports an inclusive, barrier-free society
3.  Declaration on Full Participation    :  Focuses specifically on the Asia-Pacific region
4.  17th Conference of State Parties     :  Themed "Rethinking disability inclusion"

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UN-CRPD's core objective is to ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights by persons with disabilities.  The Biwako Millennium Framework is indeed aligned with creating an inclusive, barrier-free, and rights-based society for people with disabilities.  A specific declaration on the full participation and equality of people with disabilities exists and focuses on the Asia-Pacific region.  The 17th session of the Conference of State Parties to the UN-CRPD did indeed have the theme of “Rethinking disability inclusion.”  All four pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a solid understanding of the UN-CRPD and associated initiatives. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing at least one accurately matched pair. Selection of (d) showcases a comprehensive grasp of the convention's goals and related frameworks.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                   Key Feature/Focus
1. PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) :  Focuses solely on improving infrastructure in Government residential schools.
2. Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana                 : Provides financial assistance for higher education of tribal girls.
3. National Health Mission                               : Aims to improve maternal health through mobile medical units in remote areas.
4.  Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission:  Primarily targets individuals holding land titles under the Forest Rights Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because the National Health Mission utilizes mobile medical units to enhance healthcare access in remote areas, aligning with its focus on maternal and child health.  The Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission directly supports individuals possessing forest rights land titles, thus emphasizing livelihood improvement for this specific group.

Option (a) is incorrect because PM-JUGA's scope extends beyond school infrastructure improvements to encompass various aspects of socio-economic development for tribal communities. Option (b) is incorrect as PM-JUGA's focus isn't solely on school infrastructure. Option (c) is incorrect. While Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana does provide financial support, it's primarily for maternal and child well-being, not specifically higher education for tribal girls. The Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission indeed targets FRA patta holders, but its scope isn't limited to just land title holders; it encompasses broader livelihood improvement strategies.


**2. With reference to UN initiatives related to food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Report                                       Key Objective/Finding
1. Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)          :  Tracks global food waste at the retail and consumer levels.
2. Food Waste Index Report 2024                         : Aims to halve per capita global food waste at retail and consumer levels by 2030.
3. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2024: Focuses on financing to end hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition.
4. Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty             : Exclusively supports initiatives related to improving agricultural yields.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because the Food Waste Index Report 2024 directly addresses the reduction of food waste at the retail and consumer levels, contributing to SDG 12.3.1 (b). The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report 2024 explicitly focuses on securing the funding necessary to eliminate hunger and malnutrition in all its forms.

Option (a) is incorrect as the GNAFC's primary goal is to coordinate efforts to address the root causes of food crises, not to track food waste. Option (c) is incorrect because while the State of Food Security and Nutrition report is accurately described,  other pairs are also correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty has a broader scope than solely improving agricultural yields; it aims to eradicate hunger and poverty while reducing inequalities.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group/Community                                    Specific Characteristic/Location
1. Juangs                                                  :  Located primarily in Chhattisgarh.
2. Bharias                                                  :  Received habitat rights under Section 3(1)(e) of the Forest Rights Act.
3. Dongria Kondhs                                          :  Reside exclusively in Madhya Pradesh.
4. Kamars                                                  :  Are not recognized as Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Bharias are explicitly mentioned as a tribal group that has been granted habitat rights under the specified section of the Forest Rights Act.

Option (a) is incorrect; Juangs are primarily located in Odisha, not Chhattisgarh. Option (c) is incorrect; Kamars are recognized as PVTGs. Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above.  The Dongria Kondhs are found in Odisha, not exclusively in Madhya Pradesh.


**4. With reference to the amendments to the International Health Regulations (IHR), 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment                                                  Specific Detail
1. Defining Pandemic Emergency                           :  Requires a communicable disease to have a wide geographical spread or a high risk of one, exceeding national health system response capabilities.
2. Establishing a Coordinating Financial Mechanism      :  Primarily benefits developed nations to enhance their pandemic preparedness.
3. Create National IHR Authorities                         :  Aims to improve coordination among countries but excludes regional collaborations.
4.  Successor of the International Sanitary Regulations (1951):  The IHR are not the successor of the International Sanitary Regulations.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The amendment defining a pandemic emergency accurately reflects the criteria outlined in the IHR amendments.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The coordinating financial mechanism is designed to assist developing countries, not solely developed ones. The creation of national IHR authorities explicitly aims to improve international coordination, including regional collaborations.  The IHR 2005 is indeed the successor to the 1951 regulations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                             Mandate/Focus
1. UNICEF                                                   :  Primarily focuses on issues related to adult literacy.
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                            :  Provides food assistance and promotes food security worldwide.
3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)                :  Exclusively deals with population control measures.
4. GAIN (Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition)         :  Works to improve nutrition through public-private partnerships.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The World Food Programme's mandate directly aligns with providing food aid and promoting food security.  GAIN's focus on improving nutrition through public-private partnerships is also accurately described.

Option (a) is incorrect; UNICEF's focus is broader than adult literacy, encompassing children's rights and well-being. Option (c) is incorrect; FAO's work extends beyond population control to encompass broader aspects of food and agriculture. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies mentioned above.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tribal Group                     State
1. Paudi Bhuyans                   :   Madhya Pradesh
2. Bharias                          :   Odisha
3. Kamars                           :   Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                       :   Maharashtra
5. Chuktia Bhunjia                  :   West Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Kamars are indeed found in Chhattisgarh, and the Maria Gond tribe resides in Maharashtra.  The other pairings are incorrect. Paudi Bhuyans are found in Odisha, not Madhya Pradesh. Bharias are a tribal group of Madhya Pradesh, not Odisha. Finally, the Chuktia Bhunjia tribe is located in Odisha, not West Bengal. This question tests factual recall about the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India.  Understanding the geographical distribution of various tribal communities is crucial for comprehending India's demographic diversity and the challenges related to their socio-economic development. The incorrect options include plausible distractors, designed to test the candidate's in-depth knowledge of the subject.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                            Funding Source
1. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)       :   100% Central Assistance
2. 'Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs)' Scheme :  State Government Funding
3. PM-JUGA                           :   Existing DAPST grants
4.  National Health Mission          :   International Funding


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. PM-JUGA (Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan) utilizes funding from the existing Development Action Plan for Scheduled Tribes (DAPST) grants allocated under Central Sector and Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Option 1 is incorrect because PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) involves both Central and State government funding, not solely 100% Central assistance. Option 2 is incorrect as the PVTG scheme receives 100% Central assistance, not state funding. Option 4 is incorrect as the National Health Mission is primarily funded domestically, not internationally. This question tests the understanding of the funding mechanisms of various government schemes targeting tribal development in India.  A thorough understanding of funding sources is important for analyzing the financial sustainability and efficacy of such initiatives.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge of the funding models.

Each pair accurately reflects the primary goal of the respective initiative. PMGKAY directly aims to provide free food grains to alleviate hunger among the poor.  Pradhan Mantri Matru Vandana Yojana offers financial assistance to mothers, supporting improved nutrition for both mothers and their children.  Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 focus on providing supplementary nutrition to address nutritional deficiencies in children. The Rome Declaration on Nutrition has a global focus, aiming to eradicate hunger and all forms of malnutrition.  The question assesses factual recall of various Indian and international initiatives aimed at tackling hunger and malnutrition.  The inclusion of all four correct pairs makes this a difficult question, requiring a comprehensive understanding of different schemes and their objectives.  The lack of distractors makes it challenging to guess the correct answer; precise knowledge is essential.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Mandate/Function
1. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) :   Promoting nutrition investments in the agri-food sector
2. World Food Programme (WFP)                 :  Providing food assistance and promoting food security globally
3. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)       :   Reducing food losses along production and supply chains (FLI custodian)
4. UN International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) : Addressing child health and nutrition issues

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly match the organization with its primary mandate or function. GAIN's focus is on nutrition investments in the agri-food sector to improve nutrition outcomes.  The WFP provides food assistance worldwide and works to improve food security. The FAO is indeed the custodian of the Food Loss Index (FLI) and works to reduce food losses across the supply chain.  UNICEF's work significantly involves child health and nutrition.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their roles in global food security and nutrition.  The inclusion of all four correct pairs makes it a challenging question demanding precise knowledge of each organization's functions.  The absence of distractors increases the difficulty level, making guessing unlikely.


**5. With reference to the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                     Accuracy
1.  42 countries have alarming hunger levels, making the 2030 Zero Hunger goal unattainable:  True
2.  The world's GHI score is 18.3, considered moderate in severity: True
3.  India's GHI score is 27.3, falling under the "serious" category: True
4.  India's ranking improved to 105th out of 127 countries in 2024: True

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect findings from the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 report. The report highlighted that 42 countries faced alarming levels of hunger, jeopardizing the 2030 Zero Hunger goal.  The world's average GHI score of 18.3 was indeed categorized as moderate.  India's GHI score of 27.3 placed it in the "serious" category, and its ranking improved from 111th in 2023 to 105th in 2024.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key findings of the GHI 2024 report and their ability to interpret the data presented.  The inclusion of all four correct pairs makes this a challenging question, requiring precise recall of the report's findings.  The absence of distractors makes guessing unlikely.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Mission                                  Ministry/Organization Primarily Involved
1. PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) : Ministry of Tribal Affairs
2. PM-SHRI Schools                               : Ministry of Education
3. National Health Mission                         : Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
4. Skill India Mission                             : Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Pradhan Mantri Janjatiya Unnat Gram Abhiyan (PM-JUGA), also known as Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Tribal Affairs, aiming to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities.  PM-SHRI Schools is a flagship initiative of the Ministry of Education focused on upgrading government schools. The National Health Mission is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Skill India Mission, launched by the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, aims to enhance the skills of the Indian workforce.  Finally, Swadesh Darshan, a Central Government Scheme, is implemented by the Ministry of Tourism to promote tourism in India, specifically focusing on showcasing the country's rich cultural heritage.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all five correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer.  The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Category Ranked                               Institution that Topped
1. Overall Category                             : IIT Madras
2. Universities Category                         : IISc Bangalore
3. Open Universities Category                    : IGNOU
4. State Public Universities Category            :  University of Hyderabad
5. Skill Universities Category                   :  A Skill University


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

IIT Madras topped the Overall category and IISc Bangalore topped the Universities category in NIRF 2024 rankings. These are factual and verifiable statements.  However, the NIRF report doesn't explicitly state which institutions topped the newly introduced categories of Open Universities, State Public Universities, and Skill Universities. While it's likely that certain universities held top positions,  the specific names are not definitively stated in the provided source material. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include claims about the top-ranked institutions in the newly added categories that are not substantiated.  Only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively correct based on the information provided.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Index                                   Publishing Organization
1. Global Gender Gap Report 2024                : World Economic Forum (WEF)
2. Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022            : United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)
3. Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024                 : Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe
4. Henley Passport Index                          : Henley & Partners
5. Times Higher Education World University Rankings: Quacquarelli Symonds (QS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Global Gender Gap Report 2024 is indeed published by the World Economic Forum (WEF). The Gender Inequality Index (GII) 2022 is published by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). The Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2024 is a joint publication of Concern Worldwide and Welthungerhilfe. The Henley Passport Index is published by Henley & Partners. However, the Times Higher Education World University Rankings are published by Times Higher Education, not Quacquarelli Symonds (QS), which publishes its own QS World University Rankings. Therefore, option (b) is correct because it includes all correctly matched pairs except the last one. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either incorrectly include the incorrectly matched pair 5 or exclude a correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribe                                         State
1. Juangs                                        : Odisha
2. Bharias                                       : Madhya Pradesh
3. Kamars                                        : Chhattisgarh
4. Maria Gond                                    : Maharashtra
5. Paudi Bhuyans                                 : Andhra Pradesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Forest Rights Act, 2006, grants habitat rights to certain Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs).  The Juangs are a PVTG in Odisha, Bharias in Madhya Pradesh, Kamars in Chhattisgarh, and Maria Gond in Maharashtra.  However, the Paudi Bhuyans are primarily located in Odisha, not Andhra Pradesh.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) accurately reflects this. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include the incorrectly matched pair 5 or exclude a correctly matched pair.  This question tests factual recall of the geographical distribution of specific tribal groups in India within the context of the FRA.


**5. With reference to the  United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), consider the following pairs:**

   SDG Number                                    Focus Area
1. SDG 2                                         : Zero Hunger
2. SDG 3                                         : Good Health and Well-being
3. SDG 4                                         : Quality Education
4. SDG 8                                         : Decent Work and Economic Growth
5. SDG 9                                         : Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. SDG 2 focuses on ending hunger, achieving food security and improved nutrition, and promoting sustainable agriculture. SDG 3 aims to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages. SDG 4 focuses on ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong learning opportunities for all.  SDG 8 promotes sustained, inclusive, and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment, and decent work for all.  Finally, SDG 9 builds resilient infrastructure, promotes inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and fosters innovation.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the key focus areas of these specific SDGs.  The other options are incorrect because they either exclude some correctly matched pairs or include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                  Key Feature/Objective
1. PM-JUGA (Dharti Aaba Janjatiya Gram Utkarsh Abhiyan) : Aims to improve the socio-economic conditions of tribal communities through infrastructure development
2.  National Health Accounts Estimates                :  Tracks financial flows within India’s health system since 2013-14
3.  UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UN-CRPD) :  Entered into force in 2008 with 164 signatories including India
4.  Development of Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) Scheme :  Provides 100% central assistance for socio-economic development of PVTGs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  PM-JUGA's primary goal is indeed to uplift the socio-economic status of tribal communities by focusing on improving infrastructure, health, education, and livelihoods.  The National Health Accounts Estimates, as stated, have been tracking India's healthcare finances since 2013-14. The UN-CRPD, adopted in 2006 and coming into force in 2008, has indeed garnered 164 signatories, including India. Finally, the PVTG scheme offers 100% central funding for the comprehensive development of these vulnerable groups.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to healthcare initiatives in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                       Implementation Detail
1.  Ayushman Bharat Card                           :  Linked to PM Jan Arogya Yojana
2.  National Health Mission (NHM)                   :  Mobile Medical Units for immunization in remote areas
3.  Advance facilities for diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) : Centers of Competence (CoC) established in AIIMS and premier state institutes
4.  National Quality Assurance Standards (NQAS) Assessment :  Launched for Ayushman Arogya Mandirs (AAM) and Integrated Public Health Laboratories (IPHL)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Ayushman Bharat Card is indeed a key component of the PM Jan Arogya Yojana, providing access to healthcare services. The National Health Mission utilizes Mobile Medical Units to extend immunization coverage to remote areas, particularly where sub-centers are far.  The initiative to advance Sickle Cell Disease diagnosis correctly involves establishing Centers of Competence in leading institutions.  Finally, the NQAS assessment is accurately described as covering AAMs and IPHLs.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs, making it the accurate answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to include all the correct matches.


**3. With reference to tribal welfare schemes in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                          Key Provision/Focus
1. Sustainable Livelihood Forest Right Holders (FRA) Mission:  Focuses on 22 lakh FRA patta holders
2. Tribal Home Stay Scheme                         : Promoted under Swadesh Darshan by Ministry of Tourism
3. Tribal Multipurpose Marketing Centre (TMMC)    : Aims to minimize post-harvest losses for tribal producers
4. PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin)                        : Provides pucca houses for eligible tribal households


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the features of the respective schemes. The Sustainable Livelihoods mission for FRA patta holders explicitly targets the 22 lakh holders.  The Tribal Home Stay scheme is correctly identified as being promoted under Swadesh Darshan. The TMMCs are accurately described as aiming to reduce post-harvest losses and ensure fair prices. Finally, PM Awaas Yojana (Gramin) is indeed focused on providing pucca houses to eligible tribal households.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that correctly identifies all the matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                      Salient Feature
1.  UGC (Setting up and Operation of Campuses of Foreign Higher Educational Institutions in India) Regulations, 2023 :  Facilitates the entry of top 500 globally ranked foreign universities
2.  Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA) : Defines 'habitat' for primitive tribal groups
3.  Forest Rights Act, 2006 (FRA)                    : Grants habitat rights to Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups (PVTGs) under Section 3(1)(e)
4. Criminal Tribes Act, 1871                         :  'Notified' certain communities as 'born criminals'


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The UGC regulations of 2023 aim to allow top-ranked foreign universities to establish campuses in India. The Forest Rights Act, 2006, specifically defines "habitat" within its framework for tribal groups.  The same Act also grants habitat rights to PVTGs under the specified section. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 is notorious for its discriminatory labeling of certain communities.  Therefore, option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the correct number of matched pairs.


**5. With reference to global food security and nutrition, consider the following pairs:**

   Report/Initiative                                 Key Focus/Characteristic
1. State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World Report, 2024 :  Focuses on financing to end hunger and malnutrition
2. Global Network Against Food Crises (GNAFC)       : Launched in 2016 by the European Union, FAO, and WFP
3. Food Waste Index Report 2024                     : Tracks food waste at retail and consumer levels, contributing to SDG 12.3.1 (b)
4.  Global Report on Food Crises (GRFC)            : Produced annually by the Food Security Information Network (FSIN)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 2024 State of Food Security and Nutrition report centers on financing solutions to combat hunger and malnutrition. The GNAFC, as stated, was indeed launched in 2016 by the mentioned organizations. The Food Waste Index Report 2024 accurately tracks food waste at the retail and consumer levels, directly contributing to the specified SDG indicator. Lastly, the GRFC is accurately described as an annual publication of FSIN.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.
