**1. With reference to Indian Judiciary, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                      Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                    :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim
2. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                  :   Defines both civil and criminal contempt
3. Article 137 of the Constitution                 :   Deals with review petitions in the Supreme Court
4. Article 282 of the Constitution                :   Empowers discretionary grants by the Centre and States
5.  Indian Evidence Act, 1872                     :  Rules of evidence applicable in Gram Nyayalayas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas from its purview.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, comprehensively defines both civil and criminal contempt. Article 137 of the Constitution grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments.  Article 282 allows for discretionary grants for public purposes.  However, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, is *not* directly applicable in Gram Nyayalayas; they are guided by principles of natural justice instead.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair related to the Indian Evidence Act. Option (b) accurately identifies the four correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Constitutional Provisions and their Applications, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                           Application/Feature
1. Article 341(1)                                  :   Specifies Scheduled Castes for states/union territories
2. Article 341(2)                                  :   Parliament's power to alter the Scheduled Castes list
3. Article 72                                      :   President's power to grant pardons, etc., including death sentences
4. Article 142                                    :   Supreme Court's power to do complete justice
5. Article 22(3)                                   :   Exceptions to protection against arrest/detention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 341(1) correctly defines the President's role in specifying Scheduled Castes.  Article 341(2) accurately describes Parliament's power to modify the Scheduled Castes list. Article 72 correctly outlines the President's pardon powers. Article 142 correctly describes the Supreme Court's inherent powers to ensure complete justice.  Article 22(3) correctly points to the exceptions related to preventive detention where protections against arrest are not applicable.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. All other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.



**3. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955 and related legislation, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                  Feature/Requirement
1. Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955        :   Electronic application for naturalization
2. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019         :   Reduced naturalization period for certain religious groups
3. Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920          :   Affected by CAA exemptions for certain groups
4. Foreigners Act, 1946                          :   Affected by CAA exemptions for certain groups
5.  Article 244(2)                               :   Deals with the Sixth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955, introduced an electronic application process for naturalization. The CAA, 2019, significantly reduced the naturalization period for specific religious groups from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.  The CAA, 2019, provided exemptions from the penal consequences under both the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and the Foreigners Act, 1946.  Article 244(2) is related to the Sixth Schedule provisions, making the last pair incorrect. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair or exclude correctly matched pairs. Option (b) is the most appropriate, correctly identifying four pairs.


**4. With reference to  the Panchayati Raj system and related initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                                      Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan/People’s Plan Campaign          :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
2.  Gram Nyayalayas                                     :   Settlement of petty disputes at the village level
3.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI)                   :   Assessment of panchayat development
4.  Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution              :  Guarantee right to be free from adverse effects of climate change
5.  Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991   :   Maintains religious character of places of worship as of 15 August 1947


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed designed to resolve petty disputes at the village level. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to assess the progress and performance of panchayats. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947. However, Articles 14 and 21 are related to the right to life and equality and were interpreted in a recent Supreme Court case to include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change, but this is not a direct, original constitutional pairing.   Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. Option (b) correctly identifies four of the five pairs.


**5. With reference to Special Status and Financial Provisions for States, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Concept                                  Feature
1. Special Category States (SCS)                     :   No longer exist after 14th Finance Commission recommendations
2.  Article 282 of the Constitution                  :   Empowers discretionary grants for public purposes
3.  Special Packages for States                       :   Additional financial assistance for states facing challenges
4.  Sixth Schedule of the Constitution                :   Provides for Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in certain states
5.  Gadgil-Mukherjee Formula                         :   Used for grants to SCS states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Special Category States (SCS) ceased to exist following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. Article 282 correctly describes the power to make discretionary grants. Special packages are used to support states with specific challenges. The Sixth Schedule correctly outlines the establishment of ADCs and ARCs. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for distributing grants to SCS states.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Key Provision/Exemption
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                     :   Exempts Nagaland from its jurisdiction
2.  Indian Evidence Act, 1872                     :   Replaced by Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam
3. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                   : Defines both civil and criminal contempt
4. Citizenship Act, 1955                          :  Amended by CAA, 2019

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states, including Nagaland, from its application.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has indeed been replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a legal framework for defining and addressing contempt of court, encompassing both civil and criminal contempt.  Finally, the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019 directly amends the Citizenship Act, 1955.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the legal framework of these acts and amendments is crucial for comprehending the Indian judicial and citizenship systems.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Amendment/Act                       Provision/Feature
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992        :   Established AuditOnline application
2.  Article 244(2)                                  :   Empowers Governor to create ARCs
3.  Article 3                                       :   Deals with formation of new states
4. Official Languages Act, 1963                     :   Established the Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act deals with Panchayati Raj Institutions, but the AuditOnline application was developed later by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not directly by the amendment itself. Article 244(2) forms the basis for the creation of Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in the Sixth Schedule areas.  Article 3 of the Constitution grants Parliament the power to create new states or alter existing ones. The Official Languages Act, 1963, led to the formation of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL). Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate the 73rd Amendment with AuditOnline and/or omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  A complete understanding of the Indian Constitution and its amendments is crucial for answering this question correctly.


**3. With reference to Local Governance Auditing, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                                  Role/Responsibility
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Sets global standards for auditing local governance
2.  CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 :   Mandates CAG's audit of local bodies
3.  Ministry of Panchayati Raj                         :   Developed the AuditOnline application
4. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)           : Works under the technical guidance of the CAG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

iCAL aims to establish international standards for local governance auditing. The CAG Act of 1971 grants the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) the authority to audit local bodies. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj developed the AuditOnline application for online auditing of panchayat accounts.  ELFAs, along with DLFA, operate under the CAG's supervision. Thus all the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete, omitting at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests knowledge of the auditing mechanisms in place for local governance in India, highlighting the roles of various central and state-level entities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                      Purpose/Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                              :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
2.  Aadhaar Act, 2016                               :   Mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes
3.  Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 :   Exempts the Ayodhya site
4. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)            : Funded jointly by the Centre and States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on preparing Panchayat Development Plans. The Aadhaar Act makes Aadhaar mandatory for accessing several social welfare schemes. The Places of Worship Act protects the religious character of places of worship, with a notable exception for the Ayodhya site. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are indeed funded jointly by the central and state governments.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. This question tests the understanding of various government schemes and acts related to governance and development in India.


**5. With reference to Citizenship, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Rule/Process                                 Provision/Requirement
1. Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024            :   Enforces the CAA, 2019
2.  Citizenship by Naturalization                   :   Requires knowledge of a language in the 8th Schedule
3.  Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964              :   Establishes Foreigners Tribunals
4.  CAA, 2019                                      :   Reduced naturalization period for certain migrants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, aim to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.  Naturalization as a route to citizenship requires demonstrating knowledge of a language listed in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, established the mechanism for Foreigners Tribunals. The CAA, 2019, indeed reduced the naturalization period for certain categories of migrants.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing at least one correct pairing. This question assesses knowledge of the Indian citizenship laws and the processes involved in acquiring citizenship.


**1. With reference to the Panchayati Raj system and planning, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                  Key Feature/Objective
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign)     :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26 based on Panchayat Development Index (PDI)
2. Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas                        :   Launched in 2018 to accelerate people's participation in PDP preparation across three Panchayat tiers.
3. Gram Nyayalayas                                 :   Settling petty disputes at the village level through conciliation, guided by principles of natural justice.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People’s Plan Campaign, is a crucial initiative aimed at accelerating people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  The campaign leverages the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps. The PDI is a multi-domain index assessing the overall development of panchayats.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas was indeed launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj as the initial name for Jan Yojana Abhiyan. Its core objective is to enhance people's involvement in the preparation of PDPs at all three levels of Panchayats. This makes pair 2 a correct match.

Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, are designed to resolve minor civil and criminal disputes at the village level.  A key aspect of their functioning is the use of conciliation to settle disputes, adhering to principles of natural justice rather than strictly following the Indian Evidence Act. Thus, pair 3 is also correctly matched.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to the auditing and governance of local bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                           Characteristic/Function
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, first of its kind in India.
2.  Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)           :  Prepared with active involvement of elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations.
3.  Audit of Local Bodies                           :  Ensures accountability and transparency in the financial management of local governance.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is indeed the first of its kind in India. Its primary objective is to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) are prepared through a participatory process involving elected representatives, government officials, and community organizations like SHGs. This collaborative approach underscores the importance of inclusive planning. Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched.

Auditing of local bodies is an essential mechanism to ensure accountability and transparency in their financial management.  Regular audits help to detect irregularities, promote efficient resource allocation, and build public trust. Thus, pair 3 is correctly matched.  All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.



**3. With reference to special category states and financial assistance, consider the following pairs:**

   State-related Policy/Provision                       Feature/Characteristic
1. Special Category States (SCS)                    :   Grants were previously based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, but this ceased to exist after the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.
2. Special Financial Packages                       :   Provided to states facing geographical and socio-economic challenges under Article 282.
3.  Sixth Schedule to the Constitution              :   Provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states, currently not including Ladakh.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Special Category States (SCS) once received financial grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  However, following recommendations from the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS category was discontinued.  The current special funding for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on different criteria. This makes pair 1 correct.

Special financial packages, granted under Article 282 of the Constitution, offer additional financial aid and other benefits to states facing significant geographical or socio-economic challenges.  These packages are discretionary and not solely based on need. This clarifies pair 2.

The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution outlines the administrative structure for tribal areas in specific states.  While there's a recent push to include Ladakh, it is currently not included.  This confirms pair 3.

Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they miss at least one correctly matched pair.



**4.  With reference to the judicial system and legal processes in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Process                            Characteristic/Provision
1. Contempt of Court                               :   Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, with powers vested in the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 129 and 215.
2. Mercy Petition                                  :   The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., is enshrined in Article 72, applicable to death sentences and offenses under Union executive power.
3. Curative Petition                               :   The last constitutional remedy, shaped by the Rupa Ashok Hurra case, arising from Article 142's power to ensure complete justice.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Contempt of Court, as defined by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, allows the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish individuals for actions that undermine their authority or interfere with the administration of justice.  Articles 129 and 215 grant these courts the power to do so. Thus, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to pardon, reprieve, or commute sentences, including death sentences, for offenses under Union laws or court-martial proceedings. This explains pair 2.

The Curative Petition, established through the Rupa Ashok Hurra case, serves as the final legal recourse available after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  This stems from Article 142, which grants the Supreme Court the power to ensure complete justice.  This makes pair 3 a correct match.

Therefore, all three pairs are accurately matched, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to specific courts and their functions, consider the following pairs:**

   Court/Tribunal                                     Jurisdiction/Function
1. Gram Nyayalayas                                   :   Mobile courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction to settle petty disputes at the village level.
2. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)                :   Centrally sponsored scheme focusing on swift disposal of rape cases and POCSO Act cases.
3.  Special Courts under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988:   Hear cases related to offenses committed by public servants under the PCA.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, are mobile courts with jurisdiction over petty civil and criminal cases at the village level. They emphasize conciliation to resolve disputes. This makes pair 1 correct.

Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), launched as a centrally sponsored scheme, are designed to expedite the trial of rape and POCSO Act cases.  Their objective is to ensure swift justice for victims.  This clarifies pair 2.

Special Courts are designated under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, to handle cases involving offenses committed by public servants. These courts play a crucial role in tackling corruption within the government. This explains pair 3.

All three pairs are correctly matched, hence option (d) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**6. With reference to Aadhaar and its related aspects, consider the following pairs:**

   Aadhaar Feature/Characteristic                      Description/Implication
1. Random Number                                     :   Does not contain details like caste, religion, income, health, or geography.
2. Proof of Address and Identity                     :   Serves as proof of address and identity for residents of India, but not citizenship or domicile.
3.  Targeted Delivery of Benefits                    :   Central/State Governments can make Aadhaar mandatory for accessing benefits under schemes funded from Consolidated Funds.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Aadhaar number is a randomly generated unique identifier, devoid of personal details such as caste, religion, income, health status, or geographic location. This ensures privacy to a certain extent.  This makes pair 1 correct.

Aadhaar serves as a proof of address and identity for Indian residents, but it is not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  This distinction is crucial. This clarifies pair 2.

The Aadhaar Act, 2016, allows Central and State Governments to mandate Aadhaar for accessing benefits under schemes funded by Consolidated Funds. This targeted delivery mechanism aims to enhance efficiency and minimize leakages. This explains pair 3.

All three pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.



**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) and their administration, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of CSSs                                    Description/Feature
1. Funding                                          :   Funded jointly by the central and state governments.
2. Implementation                                  :   Implemented through states in sectors falling under the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.
3. Current Framework                               :   Based on the report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are collaborative ventures between the central and state governments, with shared funding responsibilities. This collaborative nature is a defining characteristic.  This makes pair 1 correct.

CSSs are implemented by state governments in sectors listed under the State and Concurrent Lists of the Indian Constitution.  This ensures that schemes align with the respective state's priorities and needs. This clarifies pair 2.

The current framework governing CSSs is rooted in the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, established in 2015, which focused on rationalizing these schemes. This explains pair 3.

Since all three pairs are correctly matched, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**8. With reference to  Citizenship in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Citizenship Acquisition Method                        Requirement/Condition
1. Citizenship by Birth                               :   Born in India on or after 26 January 1950
2. Citizenship by Descent                             :   One parent is a citizen of India at the time of the child's birth
3. Citizenship by Naturalization                        :   Adequate knowledge of a language listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Citizenship by birth in India is acquired by individuals born in India on or after January 26, 1950. This straightforward condition is a fundamental aspect of Indian citizenship law. This clarifies pair 1.

Citizenship by descent is granted to children born outside India if at least one parent is an Indian citizen at the time of the child's birth. This provision addresses the citizenship of children born to Indian citizens abroad.  This makes pair 2 correct.

Citizenship by naturalization requires fulfilling certain conditions, including demonstrating adequate knowledge of a language from the Eighth Schedule of the Indian Constitution. This condition reflects the importance of linguistic integration. This explains pair 3.

All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.



**9. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following pairs:**

   CAA Provision                                       Detail/Condition
1.  Eligibility for Non-Muslim Migrants                :   Must have entered India on or before December 31, 2014.
2.  Exemption from Penal Consequences               :   Exempted from penalties under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and the Foreigners Act, 1946.
3.  Reduced Naturalization Period                     :   Reduced from 11 years to 5 years for specified categories of migrants.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, grants eligibility for citizenship to non-Muslim migrants from specified countries who entered India before December 31, 2014.  This cut-off date is a critical element of the Act. This clarifies pair 1.

The CAA exempts eligible non-Muslim migrants from penalties under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and the Foreigners Act, 1946. This provision addresses the legal status of these migrants. This makes pair 2 correct.

The CAA reduces the naturalization period from 11 years to 5 years for the specific categories of migrants mentioned in the Act.  This accelerated path to citizenship is a key feature. This explains pair 3.

Since all three pairs are correctly matched, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.



**10. With reference to Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) and their status, consider the following pairs:**

   OCI Aspect                                          Description/Feature
1.  OCI Cardholders                                  :   Existing OCI rules remain unchanged, addressing concerns about reclassification.
2.  OCI Registration Cancellation                     :   The central government can cancel OCI registration on five specified grounds.
3.  OCI Status                                        :   OCI cardholders are not citizens of India but enjoy certain privileges and benefits.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Recent clarifications from the Ministry of External Affairs confirm that the existing rules for Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) cardholders remain unchanged.  This addresses concerns about potential changes to their status.  This makes pair 1 correct.

The central government retains the power to cancel OCI registration based on five specific grounds outlined in relevant legislation. This provision provides a mechanism for addressing potential misuse or violations. This clarifies pair 2.

OCI cardholders are not Indian citizens but are granted certain privileges and benefits under the relevant laws. This distinction is fundamental to understanding their status. This explains pair 3.

All three pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.



**1. With reference to the Indian Fiscal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                      Subject Matter
1. Article 270                               :   Distribution of taxes between Union and States
2. Article 275                               :   Grants-in-aid to States
3. Article 292                               :   Borrowing by State Governments outside India
4. Article 280                               :   Appointment of the Union Finance Minister

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  Article 275 pertains to grants-in-aid from the Union to the States.  Crucially, Article 292 explicitly grants the Union government the power to borrow money both within and outside India, while state governments can borrow only within India (and not abroad) under Article 293.  The Finance Commission is established under Article 280, not the Union Finance Minister's appointment. The Union Finance Minister's appointment is not directly addressed in the Constitution but is a matter of convention and practice. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                     Characteristic
1. Andhra Pradesh                            :   Granted SCS in 1969
2. Nagaland                                   :   Granted SCS based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
3. Jammu & Kashmir                          :   Received special funding based on 14th Finance Commission recommendations
4. Sikkim                                    :   Received SCS after 1969

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Nagaland was among the initial states granted Special Category Status (SCS) in 1969, along with Jammu & Kashmir and Assam.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for the distribution of grants to SCS states.  Jammu & Kashmir's special funding status, however, ceased to exist with the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. Sikkim was granted SCS after 1969. Andhra Pradesh was not granted SCS in 1969.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Mechanism/Platform                        Key Feature
1. CPGRAMS                                 :   Operates only during election periods
2. Directorate of Public Grievances          :   Handles grievances at the district level
3. AuditOnline                              :   Developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj
4.  E-Nivaran                               :   Designed for fast-tracking taxpayer grievances

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CPGRAMS is a 24/7 online platform for lodging grievances, not limited to election periods. The Directorate of Public Grievances operates at the national level, not specifically at the district level.  AuditOnline, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is used for online auditing of Panchayat accounts. E-Nivaran is a platform specifically designed to expedite the resolution of taxpayer grievances. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian Judiciary and Legal Processes, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Process/Petition                    Key Characteristic
1. Mercy Petition                            :   Article 137 governs its process
2. Curative Petition                         :   Last resort after review petition dismissal
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)      :   Exclusively handle cybercrimes
4. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)   :   Settles disputes outside courtrooms


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 empowers the President's power to grant pardons, including mercy petitions, not Article 137 which relates to the Supreme Court's review power. Curative petitions are indeed the last recourse after review petitions are dismissed by the Supreme Court. FTSCs primarily focus on rape cases and POCSO Act cases, not exclusively cybercrimes. ADR mechanisms aim to resolve disputes outside traditional court settings.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Election Processes in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Mechanism                        Key Feature
1. Model Code of Conduct (MCC)           :   Has statutory backing under the Representation of the People Act
2. Lok Sabha Elections                     :   Employ a proportional representation system
3.  Election Commission of India (ECI)     :   Derives authority from Article 324
4.  Territorial Representation              :   Each constituency elects multiple representatives


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Model Code of Conduct lacks statutory backing; its enforcement relies on conventions and norms. Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of territorial representation, where each constituency elects a single representative, not multiple. The Election Commission's authority stems from Article 324. Territorial representation involves electing one representative per constituency.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                  Subject Matter
1. Article 270                           :   Taxes levied and collected by the Union, distributed between Union and States
2. Article 275                           :   Grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to States
3. Article 280                           :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 292                           :   Union Government's power to borrow money within or outside India
5. Article 293                           :   State Government's power to borrow money within India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States. Article 275 empowers the Union to provide grants-in-aid to States. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of resources. Article 292 grants the Union the power to borrow money both domestically and internationally. Article 293 allows State Governments to borrow within India, but not abroad, and requires prior Union consent if the State is already indebted to the Centre.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading information in any of the pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Finance Commission Recommendation         Feature
1. 14th Finance Commission                 :   Abolition of Plan-Non Plan distinction in central government expenditure
2. 15th Finance Commission                 :   Vertical devolution of 41% of the divisible pool to states
3. Gadgil-Mukherjee Formula               :   Grant allocation to Special Category States
4. Sub-Group of Chief Ministers Report (2015): Rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 14th Finance Commission played a crucial role in reforming the Indian fiscal federalism structure by abolishing the distinction between Plan and Non-Plan expenditure in the central government budget. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a vertical devolution of 41% of the divisible pool to the states. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used for allocating grants to Special Category States. Finally, the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers' report in 2015 provided a framework for the rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct response.  There is no element of incorrect information or misleading data within the provided pairings.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                      Key Feature/Provision
1.  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):  Prior permission required to receive foreign funds
2.  Aadhaar Act, 2016                           :  Mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but not for opening bank accounts
3.  Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023:  Specifies penalties for data breaches up to Rs 250 crore
4.  Post Office Act, 2023                        :   Appointment of a Director-General of Postal Services (DGPS) to head India Post

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The FCRA requires prior permission for receiving foreign funds by NGOs. The Aadhaar Act, following the Supreme Court's ruling, mandates Aadhaar for social welfare schemes but not for services like bank accounts or mobile connections. The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, indeed includes hefty penalties for data breaches.  Finally, the Post Office Act, 2023, establishes the position of DGPS to lead India Post. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. The provided pairings accurately reflect the key features and provisions of each scheme or act.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/Region                                   Status/Designation
1.  Andhra Pradesh                             :  Demanded Special Category Status (SCS)
2.  Bihar                                      :  Demanded Special Category Status (SCS)
3.  Ladakh                                     :   Demand for inclusion in the Sixth Schedule
4.  Arunachal Pradesh                          :  Entire state designated as a Protected Area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have both sought Special Category Status. Ladakh has seen calls for its inclusion in the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under relevant legislation. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.  Each pairing represents an accurate and verifiable fact.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Organization                    Function/Responsibility
1.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)     :   Part of Mission Karmayogi, focusing on civil service capacity building
2.  NITI Aayog                              :   Concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies
4.  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)   :   Monitoring compliance with the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the functions and responsibilities of the respective institutions. The CBC is indeed a key component of Mission Karmayogi. NITI Aayog plays a significant role in monitoring CSSs. The iCAL aims to establish international standards for auditing local governance.  The DPBI is responsible for monitoring compliance with the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023.  Therefore, option (b) is correct.  There are no discrepancies or inaccuracies in the pairings.


**1. With reference to the Panchayati Raj System, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Key Feature/Objective
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign) :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26
2.  Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) :     Assessment of panchayats using Panchayat Development Index (PDI)
3.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI)   :     Focuses on localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
4.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is explicitly aimed at preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs), making pair 1 correct.  The Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) is a crucial component of this Abhiyan, directly linked to the assessment of Panchayats using the Panchayat Development Index (PDI), hence pair 2 is also accurate. The PDI is designed to assess the holistic development of panchayats and incorporates a thematic approach based on the localization of SDGs, thus validating pair 3. The inauguration of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) signifies a significant step towards establishing global standards for auditing local governance bodies, confirming the correctness of pair 4. All four pairs accurately reflect the described initiatives and their key features or objectives within the context of Panchayati Raj.


**2. With reference to the Indian Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Mechanism                     Characteristic/Source
1.  Vertical Devolution                       :   Distribution among states from the share allocated to them based on various criteria
2.  Horizontal Devolution                    :   Share of states from the divisible pool, currently at 41% based on the 15th Finance Commission
3.  Grants-in-Aid                            :   Provided to states as per Article 275 of the Indian Constitution
4.  Finance Commission (FC) recommendations :   Adjudicate sharing of resources between the Union and States as per Article 280

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of central taxes, currently set at 41% as per the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, involves the distribution of funds among states based on various criteria, making pair 2 incorrect.  Grants-in-aid are explicitly mentioned in Article 275 of the Constitution, making pair 3 correct. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in determining the sharing of resources between the Union and States as per Article 280, thus pair 4 is also correct.  Only pairs 3 and 4 accurately reflect the described financial mechanisms and their characteristics within the Indian fiscal federalism framework.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State/Feature                                     Characteristic/Detail
1.  Andhra Pradesh and Bihar                      :   Demanded Special Category Status (SCS)
2.  Fifth Finance Commission (FC)                 :   First introduced SCS in 1969
3.  14th Finance Commission (FC)                  :   Led to the cessation of SCS grants based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
4.  Article 371 of the Indian Constitution       :   Contains provisions for special status to states similar to SCS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have recently demanded special financial packages, highlighting the ongoing debate surrounding special status for states, making pair 1 correct. The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations in 1969 led to the initial grant of SCS to several states, validating pair 2. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the system of SCS grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, making pair 3 correct. While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS, Article 371 and its subsequent clauses offer a range of special provisions to various states, which effectively serves a similar purpose to SCS, thus pair 4 is correct.  Therefore, all four pairs correctly reflect factual information concerning the Special Category Status in India.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature/Aspect                          Detail/Characteristic
1.  CSS Funding Pattern (North Eastern States) :  Centre:State ratio of 90:10
2.  CSS Funding Pattern (Other States)          :  Centre:State ratio of 100%
3.  CSS Funding Route                            :   Through the Consolidated Fund of the State
4.  CSS Monitoring                               :   NITI Aayog has concurrent jurisdiction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The funding pattern for Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in eight Northeastern and three Himalayan states is indeed 90:10 (Centre:State), making pair 1 correct. The funding for CSS is routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State, confirming pair 3. NITI Aayog does have concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSS and overseeing third-party evaluations, hence pair 4 is accurate.  However, the funding pattern for other states is 60:40 (Centre:State), not 100% as stated in pair 2, making it incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following pairs:**

   DPBI Function/Power                          Description/Detail
1.  Imposing Penalties                           :   For non-compliance with data protection regulations
2.  Grievance Redressal                          :   Hearing grievances made by affected persons
3.  Appointment of Board Members                :   For a fixed term of five years with eligibility for reappointment
4.  Appeals against DPBI decisions             :   Lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) does have the power to impose penalties for violations of data protection regulations, making pair 1 correct. It also handles grievances from affected persons, validating pair 2.  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the TDSAT, making pair 4 correct. However, the term of DPBI members is two years, not five, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect/Feature                                 Detail/Characteristic
1.  Article 244(2)                               :   Basis for the Sixth Schedule
2.  Bardoloi Committee                           :   Recommended the inclusion of the Sixth Schedule
3.  Ladakh                                        :   Increased demand for its inclusion in the Sixth Schedule
4.  Autonomous District Councils                  :   Administer areas under the Sixth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 244(2) of the Indian Constitution forms the legal basis for the Sixth Schedule, making pair 1 correct. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were instrumental in the creation of the Sixth Schedule, thus pair 2 is also correct.  There's a growing demand to include Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule, validating pair 3. The Sixth Schedule establishes Autonomous District Councils to administer specific areas, confirming pair 4. All four pairs accurately reflect the relevant aspects and features of the Sixth Schedule.


**7. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect/Component                                  Detail/Characteristic
1.  National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) :   Launched in 2021 as part of Mission Karmayogi
2.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)             :   Completed three years in 2024
3.  Mission Karmayogi Guiding Principles              :   Shift from rule-based to role-based training
4.  Target Group for Mission Karmayogi              :   All civil servants (including contractual employees)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) is indeed the foundation of Mission Karmayogi and was launched in 2021, making pair 1 correct. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), a key component, completed three years recently, hence pair 2 is also correct.  Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles include a shift from rule-based to role-based training, validating pair 3.  The program targets all civil servants, including contractual employees, thus pair 4 is accurate.  All four pairs correctly reflect the features and components of Mission Karmayogi.


**8. With reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, consider the following pairs:**

   ADR Mechanism/Act                            Key Feature/Provision
1.  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996       :   Amended in 2015, 2019, and 2021
2.  Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021 :   Allows for unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards obtained through fraud
3.  New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019 :   Facilitates institutional arbitration
4.  Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)         :   Established in 1923 by the International Chamber of Commerce

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, has undergone several amendments, including those in 2015, 2019, and 2021, making pair 1 correct. The 2021 amendment does allow for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards obtained fraudulently, thus pair 2 is accurate. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, was specifically designed to facilitate institutional arbitration, making pair 3 correct.  However, the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) was established in 1899, not 1923, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to the Mercy Petition and Curative Petition in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Remedy/Petition                    Provision/Characteristic
1.  Mercy Petition                           :   Empowered by Article 72 of the Indian Constitution
2.  Curative Petition                         :   Last constitutional remedy available after review petition dismissal
3.  President's Power on Mercy Petition       :   Includes the power to commute a death sentence
4.  Article 137 of the Indian Constitution    :   Governs the process of filing a curative petition

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution specifically grants the President the power to grant pardons, including commuting death sentences, making pair 1 and 3 correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court, hence pair 2 is correct.  However, Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its judgments, not the procedure for curative petitions, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to the President's Address to Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Feature
1. Article 87(1) (Original)                  :   Mandated addressing both Houses at every session's commencement
2. Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951 :   Modified the requirement of addressing both Houses at every session
3. Article 86                              :   Grants the President the power to address either House or both jointly

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The original Article 87(1) indeed mandated the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.  The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, significantly altered this provision, granting more flexibility.  Article 86, as it stands currently, correctly reflects the President's power to address either House individually or both Houses jointly. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs. The question tests factual recall regarding the evolution of constitutional provisions related to the President's address to Parliament, demonstrating a nuanced understanding of the Indian Constitution's amendment process and its impact on the functioning of the legislature.


**2. With reference to the Oath of Members of Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Provision
1. Article 99                               :   Details the form of oath as per the Third Schedule
2. Article 104                               :   Specifies penalty for sitting without taking the oath
3. Third Schedule                             :   Prescribes the forms of oath for MPs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 99 of the Indian Constitution explicitly deals with the oaths of office for Members of Parliament (MPs), specifying that they are to be subscribed before the President or a designated person.  Crucially, it references the Third Schedule, which contains the prescribed forms of these oaths.  Article 104 outlines the penalty for an MP sitting in the House without having taken the oath. Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to capture the complete picture of the constitutional provisions related to the oath-taking process for MPs. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific constitutional articles and their interrelation, demonstrating a detailed understanding of the procedural aspects of parliamentary functioning.


**3. With reference to Citizenship in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                   Feature
1. Citizenship Act, 1955                        :   Allows dual citizenship
2. Section 6A of Citizenship Act, 1955        :   Added through Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985
3. Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985            :   Introduced a special provision related to Assam Accord
4. Assam Accord                                 :   Memorandum of Settlement with the central government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship Act of 1955, in its original form, does *not* provide for dual citizenship; only single citizenship is allowed.  Section 6A was indeed added through the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 1985, directly relating to the Assam Accord.  The Assam Accord itself was a significant Memorandum of Settlement between the then central government and leaders of the Assam Movement.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Citizenship Act, its amendments, and their historical context, demonstrating an understanding of the legal and political complexities surrounding citizenship in India.


**4. With reference to the President's Power of Mercy, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Scope of Power
1. Article 72                               :   Covers offences under State laws only
2. Article 72                               :   Empowers pardons, reprieves, commutations, etc.
3. Mercy Petitions                           :   Can only be filed by death-row convicts


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence. This power extends to offences under both Union and State laws.  The statement that mercy petitions can only be filed by death-row convicts is incorrect; mercy petitions can be filed for various sentences. Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include one or both of the incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's precise understanding of Article 72 and its scope, highlighting the limitations of the President's power of mercy.


**5. With reference to the Formation of New States, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Body                                Action/Recommendation
1. Article 3                                  :   Requires prior presidential recommendation for bills affecting state boundaries
2. Parliament                                 :   Can create new states through simple majority legislation
3. Fazl Ali Commission                         :   Recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 UTs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Indian Constitution explicitly states that Parliament can form new states or alter the boundaries of existing ones, but only with the prior recommendation of the President.  Parliament does indeed have the power to create new states through ordinary legislation (simple majority). The Fazl Ali Commission, established to review state reorganization, famously recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories.  Hence, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, neglecting one or more correctly matched pairs. This question tests knowledge of the constitutional provisions and historical processes related to state formation in India, demonstrating an understanding of the interplay between the legislature, the executive, and the processes of state reorganization.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                          Key Feature
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 2005
2. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)      :   Headed by a Director appointed by a selection committee
3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)   :   Conducts the Civil Services Examination
4.  Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)       :   Deals primarily with corruption cases within the government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not 2005, making pair 1 incorrect.  The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) Director's appointment process involves a selection committee, as stated in pair 2, making it correct. The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) does indeed conduct the Civil Services Examination, making pair 3 correct. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) primarily deals with corruption within the government, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                     Provision
1. Article 75(1)                               :   Deals with the appointment of the Prime Minister and other Ministers
2. Article 93                                  :   Relates to the election of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha
3. Article 99                                  :   Concerns the oath of office for Members of Parliament
4. Article 104                                 :   Prescribes penalties for Members of Parliament who sit without taking the oath


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 75(1) of the Indian Constitution explicitly details the appointment of the Prime Minister and other ministers, making pair 1 correct. Article 93 correctly outlines the election process for the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  Article 99 accurately addresses the oaths of office for Members of Parliament. Finally, Article 104 correctly specifies the penalties for MPs who sit in the House without taking the prescribed oath. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following pairs:**

   ECI Function                                 Detail
1.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC) Enforcement:  Has statutory backing under the Representation of the People Act, 1951
2.  Election Schedule Determination          :  Decided by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs
3.  Resolution of Party Disputes             :  ECI resolves disputes related to splits/mergers of recognized political parties
4.  Appointment of Election Officials        :  The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) lacks statutory backing, making pair 1 incorrect.  The Election Commission of India (ECI), not the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, determines election schedules, making pair 2 incorrect. The ECI does resolve disputes related to party splits and mergers, making pair 3 correct. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision
1.  91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003    :   Limited the size of the Council of Ministers to 15% of the Lok Sabha
2.  97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011    :   Made the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right
3.  Citizenship Act, 1955                       :   Provides for dual citizenship
4. Disaster Management Act, 2005              :  Mandates the declaration of heatwaves as notified disasters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 91st Constitutional Amendment Act, 2003, correctly limited the size of the Council of Ministers to 15% of the Lok Sabha's total membership. The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, correctly made the right to form cooperative societies a fundamental right. The Citizenship Act of 1955 does *not* provide for dual citizenship; it only allows for single citizenship, making pair 3 incorrect. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, does not mandate the declaration of heatwaves as notified disasters; this is a matter of policy and state-level implementation, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

   NHRC Aspect                                   Detail
1.  Headquarters                               :   Mumbai
2.  Establishment                             :   Under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
3.  Appointment of Chairperson and Members   :  By the President, based on a committee's recommendation
4.  Tenure of Chairperson and Members          :   Five years or until age 70, whichever is earlier


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) Only two
(c) Only one
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC's headquarters is in New Delhi, not Mumbai, making pair 1 incorrect. The NHRC was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, making pair 2 correct. The President appoints the Chairperson and Members based on a committee's recommendation, making pair 3 correct. The tenure is three years or until age 70, not five years, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (b) is too broad, and options (c) and (d) include incorrect pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution     Subject Matter
1. Article 72                        :   Power of the Governor to grant pardons
2. Article 137                       :   Power of the Supreme Court to review its own judgments
3. Article 142                       :   Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice
4. Article 342A                      :   Power of the President to specify Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBCs)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution deals with the power of the President, not the Governor, to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Article 137 grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments.  This is accurate. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, which is also correct. Article 342A empowers the President to specify SEBCs, making pair 4 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 1, or exclude the correctly matched pairs 3 and 4.  The correct option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings of constitutional articles with their respective subject matters.  Understanding the specific powers vested in different constitutional bodies is crucial for comprehending the Indian political system's structure and functioning.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Doctrine             Description
1. Doctrine of Coverture             :   A legal doctrine that grants equal rights to married women.
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:   A principle used to resolve conflicts between laws by interpreting them in a way that maintains the spirit of both.
3. Zero FIR                           :   An FIR registered in a police station other than the one having jurisdiction over the crime scene.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Coverture, originating in English common law, did *not* grant equal rights to married women; rather, it treated a married woman as a legal extension of her husband, suspending her legal existence. Thus, pair 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction is accurately described as a principle for resolving legal conflicts by maintaining the essence of both conflicting laws.  Pair 2 is correct.  A Zero FIR is indeed registered regardless of the police station's jurisdiction and is later transferred to the appropriate station for investigation; pair 3 is correct. Option (b) is the only option that reflects the correct matching of the legal concepts with their descriptions.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain the incorrectly matched pair 1, demonstrating the importance of understanding nuances in legal terminology and doctrines.


**3. With reference to the Indian Legal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Petition              Court/Authority
1. Mercy Petition                  :   Supreme Court
2. Curative Petition                :   High Court
3. Review Petition                  :   President

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mercy petitions are addressed to the President (Article 72) or Governor (Article 161), not the Supreme Court.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Curative petitions are filed in the Supreme Court, not the High Court, as a last resort after a review petition is dismissed. Pair 2 is incorrect. Review petitions are filed in the Supreme Court (Article 137) to review its own judgments, not the President. Pair 3 is incorrect. All three pairs are incorrectly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  This question highlights the importance of knowing the correct court or authority for different types of legal remedies in India. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the hierarchy of courts and their jurisdictions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                      Key Feature
1.  Indian Telegraph Act, 1885                   :   Regulates postal services
2.  Post Office Act, 2023                        :   Repeals the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933
3.  The Citizenship Act, 1955                    :   Provides for dual citizenship

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, deals with telegraphs, not postal services. The Post Office Act, 1898, regulates postal services. Thus, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Post Office Act, 2023, aims to modernize postal services and does indeed repeal the Indian Wireless Telegraph Act, 1933, along with the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 as a part of its consolidation effort. Therefore, pair 2 is correct. The Citizenship Act, 1955, *does not* provide for dual citizenship; it outlines ways to acquire Indian citizenship.  Pair 3 is incorrect. Only pair 2 is correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.  This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and their key provisions, crucial for understanding the legal framework of India.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates who may have a superficial understanding of these Acts.


**5. With reference to the functioning of Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

   Position/Role                         Responsibility
1. Pro-tem Speaker                     :   Administering oaths to newly elected MPs
2. Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha         :   Elected by the Rajya Sabha
3. President of India                   :   Addresses both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Pro-tem Speaker's primary duty is indeed administering oaths to newly elected MPs.  Pair 1 is correct. The Deputy Speaker of Lok Sabha is elected by the Lok Sabha itself, not the Rajya Sabha. Pair 2 is incorrect.  The President's addressing of both Houses at the commencement of every session is no longer mandatory due to the First Amendment Act, 1951, to Article 87(1). Pair 3 is incorrect.  Only pair 1 is correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.  This question assesses understanding of parliamentary procedures and the roles of various constitutional functionaries. The incorrect options highlight common misconceptions about the roles of the Deputy Speaker and the President in parliamentary proceedings.


**1. With reference to the Indian Parliament's Secretariats, consider the following pairs:**

    Secretariat Feature                                       Specific Detail
1. Lok Sabha Secretariat's Recruitment                      : Governed by Lok Sabha Secretariat (Recruitment and Conditions of Service) Rules, 1955
2. Rajya Sabha Secretariat's Administrative Head           :  Speaker of the Rajya Sabha
3.  Post creation in Class I or Class II of either Secretariat: Requires prior consultation with the Union Ministry of Finance
4.  Secretary-Generals of both Houses' Rank Equivalence : Equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the facts about the Indian Parliament's secretariats.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the rules governing recruitment in the Lok Sabha Secretariat. Statement 3 accurately states the requirement of prior consultation with the Union Ministry of Finance for creating Class I or Class II posts in either secretariat.  Statement 4 correctly points out the rank equivalence of the Secretary-Generals of both houses to the Cabinet Secretary.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The administrative head of the Rajya Sabha Secretariat is the Secretary General, not the Speaker of the Rajya Sabha. The Speaker is the head of the Lok Sabha, while the Chairman presides over the Rajya Sabha.  This is a common point of confusion, as both Houses have similar structures but distinct leadership.  The inclusion of this incorrect pairing serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of the organizational structure.  The other options are incorrect because they include statement 2, which is factually inaccurate.



**2. With reference to the President's Address to Parliament, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision                                  Specific Application
1. Article 86                                              :  The President addressing both Houses together
2. Article 87                                              :  The President addressing Parliament at the beginning of every session
3. Article 87, post First Amendment of the Constitution   :  The President addressing at the beginning of the first session after each general election


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Articles 86 and 87, as amended, accurately reflect the provisions regarding the President's address to Parliament. Article 86 allows the President to address either House or both Houses together, although this specific provision has not been used to date.  Article 87, as amended by the First Amendment, specifies two instances for the President's address to both Houses assembled together—at the beginning of the first session after each general election and at the beginning of the first session of each year.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Before the First Amendment, Article 87 mandated an address at the commencement of every session.  However, this was subsequently amended to the current practice. The inclusion of this incorrect statement serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the constitutional amendments and their impact on parliamentary procedure.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either omit correct statements or include the incorrect statement 2.



**3. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the electoral process, consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Provision                                     Specific Application
1. Article 324                                          :  ECI's power of superintendence, direction, and control of elections
2. Article 329(b)                                       :  Limiting judicial intervention in the electoral process post-notification by ECI
3. Section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951:  Challenging the validity of an election exclusively through an election petition


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Article 324 of the Constitution vests the Election Commission of India (ECI) with the power of superintendence, direction, and control of all elections to Parliament and State Legislatures.  Article 329(b) of the Constitution restricts judicial intervention in the electoral process, particularly after the ECI officially notifies the election process. Section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, reinforces this by specifying that the validity of any election can only be challenged through an election petition.  There are no incorrect pairings in this question; therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the legal framework governing elections in India.  The inclusion of all three correct pairings ensures that the candidate demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.


**4. With reference to the Cabinet Committees of the Union Government, consider the following pairs:**

    Cabinet Committee                                    Characteristic
1.  Political Affairs Committee                           : Chaired by the Prime Minister
2.  Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC)          : Appoints the Cabinet Secretary on seniority-cum-merit basis
3.  Economic Affairs Committee                           : Chaired by the Home Minister
4.  Parliamentary Affairs Committee                      :  Extra-constitutional in nature


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The Political Affairs Committee is indeed chaired by the Prime Minister.  The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) is responsible for appointing the Cabinet Secretary based on seniority and merit.  Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The Economic Affairs Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Home Minister.  Cabinet committees are extra-constitutional bodies, meaning they are not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but are established through the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.  The other options are incorrect because they include statements 3 and/or 4, which are factually inaccurate. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure and functioning of the Union Government.  The incorrect options act as effective distractors.


**5. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following pairs:**

    Parliamentary Committee                              Specific Detail
1. Public Accounts Committee                           :  Consists of members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
2. Estimates Committee                                  :  Examines whether money is well-laid out within policy limits
3. Committee on Official Languages (PCOL)               :  Submits recommendations to the President
4.  Committee of Privileges of Rajya Sabha             : Consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the characteristics of the respective parliamentary committees. The Public Accounts Committee does indeed include members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The Estimates Committee's function includes examining the efficient allocation of funds within the framework of existing policies. The Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) submits its recommendations to the President.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha consists of 10 members, not 15, nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement acts as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the composition of parliamentary committees.  The other options are incorrect because they include the false statement 4.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of various parliamentary committees.



**6. With reference to the Lok Sabha, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Lok Sabha                                    Specific Detail
1.  System of Election                                    : Single-member constituencies
2.  Normal Term Duration                                 : Five years
3.  Dissolution of Lok Sabha                           : Can be dissolved by the President before five years
4. Constitutional Provisions related to Lok Sabha Elections : Articles 324 to 329


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of the Lok Sabha. The Lok Sabha employs a system of territorial representation with single-member constituencies.  Its normal term is five years. The President has the constitutional power to dissolve the Lok Sabha before the completion of its five-year term. Articles 324 to 329 of the Constitution deal with provisions related to elections, encompassing the Lok Sabha elections.  Therefore, all pairings are correct, making option (c) the only viable choice. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the Lok Sabha's structure and function within the constitutional framework.  There are no incorrect pairings to act as distractors in this particular question.


**7. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of the MCC                                      Specific Detail
1.  Authority for MCC                                      : Election Commission of India (ECI)
2.  Scope of Applicability                               : All political parties, candidates, polling agents, the government in power, and government employees.
3.  Legal Basis for MCC                                  : Explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of the Model Code of Conduct (MCC). The Election Commission of India (ECI) lays down the MCC in consultation with political parties.  The MCC applies broadly to all political parties, candidates, polling agents, the ruling government, and government employees.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MCC is a set of guidelines, not a statutory provision explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.  This serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the difference between constitutional provisions and guidelines established by the ECI.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct statements or include the incorrect statement 3. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the MCC's nature, scope, and enforcement.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity in Sixth Schedule                                 Specific Detail
1.  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)                   :  Have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management
2.  Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)                 :  Covers a specific tribe within an autonomous district
3.  Governor's Role in Sixth Schedule Areas                :  Creating ADCs and ARCs
4.  Number of ADCs currently in existence                 :  10


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe aspects of the Sixth Schedule. Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) have legislative powers over various matters, including forest management.  Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) are established to cater to the needs of specific tribes within autonomous districts.  The Governor plays a crucial role in the creation of both ADCs and ARCs.  Currently, there are 10 ADCs in four states.  Therefore, all pairings are accurate, making option (c) the correct answer. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and its implementation in specific regions.  There are no incorrect pairings to act as distractors.


**9. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision or Process                     Specific Detail
1.  Article 3                                             :  Parliament's power to form new states
2.  Presidential Recommendation                         :  Required for introducing a bill for the formation of a new state
3.  Bardoloi Committee                                  :  Recommendations led to the Fifth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Constitution explicitly grants Parliament the power to form new states by altering existing state boundaries or uniting territories.  A bill for the formation of a new state requires the President's recommendation before it can be introduced in Parliament.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations led to the Sixth Schedule, not the Fifth Schedule. The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas in states other than those covered by the Sixth Schedule.  This serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the different Schedules and their respective purposes.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct statements or include the incorrect statement 3.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions related to the formation of new states in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                     Feature related to Protected/Restricted Areas
1. Arunachal Pradesh                         : Declared entirely as a Protected Area
2. Sikkim                                      : Partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area
3. Andaman & Nicobar Islands                 : Declared entirely as a Restricted Area
4. Jammu & Kashmir                           : Declared partly as a Protected Area
5. Rajasthan                                  : Declared partly as a Protected Area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that Arunachal Pradesh is wholly designated as a Protected Area, Sikkim is partly Protected and partly Restricted, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely Restricted under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  The text also mentions that parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are designated as Protected Areas. Therefore, options 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are all correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits Sikkim and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Option (b) excludes Rajasthan and Jammu & Kashmir. Option (d) omits Sikkim and the crucial information regarding the partial designation of Jammu & Kashmir and Rajasthan.  The correct answer comprehensively reflects the information presented about the geographical distribution of Protected and Restricted areas across different Indian states and Union Territories.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                     Subject Matter related to Fiscal Federalism
1. Article 246                               : Defines tax bases between Union and States
2. Article 269                               : Taxes levied and collected by the Centre but wholly assigned to Panchayats
3. Article 270                               : Taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between Union and States based on the Finance Commission's recommendations
4. Article 280                               : Establishes the Finance Commission
5. Article 293                               : Grants the Union Government the power to borrow money both within and outside the country


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 246 correctly defines the division of tax bases between the Union and States, forming a cornerstone of India's fiscal federalism. Article 270 accurately describes the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, a key aspect of revenue sharing. Article 280 correctly establishes the Finance Commission, responsible for recommending the distribution of resources.  However, Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but wholly assigned to *States*, not Panchayats.  Article 293 correctly grants power to state governments to borrow money within India, not the Union government borrowing both domestically and internationally.  Therefore, options including 2 and 5 are incorrect. Option (a) accurately reflects the correct pairings based on the provided information.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Provision related to Citizenship
1. Citizenship Act, 1955                         : Amended by the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019
2. Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964           : Establishes Quasi-judicial Foreigners Tribunals with powers to declare a person a foreigner
3. Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024          : Enforces the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019
4. Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920        :  Allows the Central Government to exempt certain individuals from passport requirements
5.  The Sixth Schedule to the Constitution      : Defines certain tribal areas where CAA, 2019 provisions do not apply


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched based on the information provided. The Citizenship Act, 1955, was indeed amended by the CAA, 2019. The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, established the quasi-judicial bodies with the power to declare individuals foreigners. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were explicitly designed to implement the CAA, 2019. The Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, grants the Central Government the authority to exempt individuals from passport requirements under certain conditions.  The Sixth Schedule to the Constitution correctly specifies certain tribal areas excluded from the CAA, 2019's application.  Therefore, option (b) is the only option that accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                      Function/Characteristic
1. Cantonment Boards                          : Administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.
2.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3. Common Service Centres (CSCs)             :  One of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), providing services to rural citizens.
4.  Finance Commission                         : Adjudicates the sharing of resources between the Union and States.
5.  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)       : Established under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and fall under the Ministry of Defence. iCAL aims to establish global standards for local governance audits. CSCs are a crucial part of the NeGP, delivering services to rural areas. The Finance Commission's role in resource allocation between the Union and States is well-established. ADCs are created under the provisions of the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution.  Therefore, all pairs are accurately matched, making option (b) the correct answer.  The other options incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                  Relevant Constitutional Provision/Article
1.  Telangana                                  : Formed under Article 3 of the Constitution.
2.  States with Special Category Status (SCS) :  Categorization is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution but special provisions are available under Articles 371-A to 371-J.
3.  Areas under the Sixth Schedule             :  Empowered to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) under Article 244(2).
4.  States receiving special financial packages:  No specific constitutional provision mandates special packages; they are discretionary grants under Article 282.
5.  Assam                                     :  Was granted Special Category Status in 1969


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The formation of Telangana is explicitly addressed under Article 3 of the Constitution. The constitutional basis for SCS is not explicitly defined, but special provisions under Articles 371-A to 371-J exist. The Sixth Schedule's authority to establish ADCs and ARCs is explicitly mentioned in Article 244(2). Special financial packages are discretionary grants under Article 282.  Assam was indeed granted SCS in 1969. Therefore, option (b) is the only option that accurately reflects the correct pairings for all five points.  The other options incorrectly omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State/Union Territory                     Status
1. Arunachal Pradesh                      :   Partly Protected Area
2. Jammu & Kashmir                        :   Partly Restricted Area
3. Sikkim                                  :   Entirely Protected Area
4. Andaman & Nicobar Islands              :   Entirely Restricted Area

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  Jammu & Kashmir has parts designated as Protected Areas, but not entirely. Sikkim is partially a Protected Area and partially a Restricted Area, not entirely a Protected Area. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as a Restricted Area. Therefore, only the pair relating to Sikkim's partial Protected Area status and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands' entirely Restricted Area status are accurately matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings due to misrepresentation of the actual status of these regions. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the geographical distribution of protected and restricted areas in India.  Understanding the nuances of the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, is crucial for correctly answering this question.


**2. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision                 Feature
1. Article 246                             :   Defines tax bases between Union and States
2. Article 269                             :   Taxes levied and collected by states but assigned to the Union
3. Article 270                             :   Distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union among states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations
4. Article 275                             :   Specifies the Union's power to borrow money outside India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 246 of the Indian Constitution clearly delineates the powers of the Union and the States regarding taxation. Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States, not the other way around. Article 270 correctly describes the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union among the States based on the Finance Commission's recommendations. Article 275 pertains to grants-in-aid from the Union to States, not borrowing powers outside India. The Union's power to borrow within and outside India is detailed in Article 292. Option (a) is the only one correctly matching the constitutional provisions with their features. Options (b), (c), and (d) include mismatched pairs, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the intricate details of India's fiscal federalism framework as enshrined in the Constitution.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional articles related to fiscal federalism.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                  Detail
1. Establishment Date                     :   1757 (post Battle of Plassey)
2. Administrative Control                 :   Ministry of Home Affairs
3. First Cantonment                         :   Madras
4. Number of Cantonments (approx.)       :   50

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Cantonments were established by the East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, making statement 1 correct.  However, the administrative control of Cantonment Boards rests with the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, making statement 2 incorrect. Barrackpore (near Calcutta), not Madras, was the first Cantonment established in 1765. The approximate number of cantonments in India is 61, not 50.  Only statement 1 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect information regarding the administrative control, the first cantonment, and the total number of cantonments. This question tests factual knowledge about Cantonment Boards, highlighting the importance of precise details in understanding their historical context and current administrative structure.  The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the subject matter.


**4. With reference to the Supreme Court's pronouncements on fundamental rights, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                   Interpretation in a recent Judgement
1. Article 14                               :   Right to be free from adverse effects of climate change
2. Article 19                               :   Right to clean air
3. Article 21                               :   Right to a healthy environment
4. Article 32                               :   Right to constitutional remedies related to environmental issues

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), thus making statement 1 correct. While the court has expanded the scope of Article 21 to include environmental rights, a specific right to clean air is not explicitly stated under Article 19, which deals with freedom of speech, etc.  Article 32 provides a remedy for violations of fundamental rights but doesn’t specifically mention environmental issues. Hence, only statement 1 is directly and accurately linked to the recent SC judgment concerning environmental rights and fundamental rights. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect interpretations or mismatched pairings of Articles with their interpretations in recent Supreme Court judgments related to environmental rights. The question tests not only factual recall but also the ability to analyze how the Supreme Court interprets and expands the scope of fundamental rights in the context of environmental protection.


**5. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Provision                                 Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                 :   Excludes all North-Eastern States
2. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                 :   Applies fully to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings
3. Principles of Natural Justice               :   Guides dispute resolution in Gram Nyayalayas
4. Court of Judicial Magistrate of First Class :   Status of Gram Nyayalayas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, exempts certain states and tribal areas, including some North-Eastern states, but not all.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, does not fully apply to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings; they are guided by principles of natural justice. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect information regarding the applicability of the Indian Evidence Act and the exclusion of states under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about this judicial system. The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of the Gram Nyayalaya system, including its legal framework and operational features. The inclusion of plausible distractors makes this question challenging and assesses analytical skills.


**1. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature
1. CSS Funding Pattern (North Eastern States) : 60:40 Centre:State
2. CSS Monitoring Jurisdiction                 :  Exclusively Ministry of Finance
3. CSS Implementation                         : Primarily through State Governments
4. CSS Funding Transfer Mechanism             : Through Consolidated Fund of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are implemented primarily through State Governments, leveraging their on-the-ground expertise and understanding of local contexts. The other statements are incorrect.  The funding pattern for North Eastern States is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 60:40.  NITI Aayog, along with the relevant ministries, has concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSSs, not solely the Ministry of Finance.  Finally, all transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.  This ensures that the state government has direct control over the funds allocated for the scheme's implementation within their respective jurisdictions.


**2. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Characteristic
1. Aadhaar Metadata Storage Limit            :  Indefinitely
2. Aadhaar's Proof of Citizenship Status     :  Yes
3.  Targeted Delivery of Benefits               :  Mandatory Aadhaar for all schemes
4.  Constitutional Validity                    :  Upheld by the Supreme Court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The Supreme Court, in its 2018 judgment, upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, while also setting important limitations on its use.  The other statements are incorrect. Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. Aadhaar is not a proof of citizenship or domicile; it only serves as proof of identity and address for residents of India.  While Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.


**3. With reference to the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan), consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                   Characteristic
1.  Thematic Approach                          : Based solely on the needs of Gram Sabhas
2.  Inclusive Participation                     :  Excludes youth below 18 years
3.  Implementation Level                      :  Only at the Gram Panchayat level
4.  Approved Panchayat Development Plan (PDP) : Published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct.  The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) is published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal to ensure transparency and accountability. The other statements are incorrect. The thematic approach is based on the localization of SDGs, utilizing a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach," not solely on Gram Sabha needs.  Inclusive participation actively engages youth and the elderly, not excluding those below 18.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is implemented at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District), not only at the Gram Panchayat level.


**4. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following pairs:**

   Characteristic                                 Detail
1.  Location                                    :  New Delhi
2.  Primary Aim                                 :  To promote the use of traditional auditing methods
3.  Collaborative Platform                       :  Exclusively for Indian Auditors
4.  Capacity Building                           :  Focuses solely on financial auditing

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not New Delhi.  Its primary aim is to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies and serve as a centre of excellence for capacity building, encompassing a broader range of auditing practices than just traditional methods. It's a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors globally, not exclusively for Indian auditors.  Finally, its capacity building initiatives extend beyond financial auditing to encompass improved financial performance assessment and service delivery.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                         Characteristic
1.  Bihar                                       :  Currently holds SCS
2.  Andhra Pradesh                             :  Historically held SCS
3.  Nagaland                                    :  Granted SCS in 1969
4.  SCS Funding                                  :  Based solely on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. Andhra Pradesh historically held SCS, and Nagaland was granted SCS in 1969.  Bihar does not currently hold SCS. The funding for SCS states is no longer based solely on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula; the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the cessation of SCS, and current special funding patterns are based on different criteria.


**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision                     Specific Provision
    1. Article 270                               :  Taxes levied and collected by the Union, distributed between Union and States.
    2. Article 275                               :  Grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to States.
    3. Article 292                               :  State governments can borrow money from outside India.
    4. Article 280                               :  Establishes the Finance Commission to adjudicate the sharing of resources.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Articles 270 and 280 accurately reflect their descriptions in the provided text.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States, a key aspect of fiscal federalism. Article 280 correctly describes the establishment and role of the Finance Commission.  Article 275 correctly states that the Centre provides grants-in-aid to states. However, Article 292 incorrectly states that state governments can borrow money from outside India; the text explicitly states that state governments can borrow only *within* India. This makes option (a) the only correct choice. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies regarding Article 292 and/or incomplete representation of the relevant articles.  The question tests factual recall of constitutional provisions related to India's fiscal federalism and the ability to identify inconsistencies in paired statements, showcasing a deep understanding of the subject matter.


**2. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                         Feature
    1. Jammu & Kashmir (before 2019)           :   Received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
    2. Andhra Pradesh                             :   Demanded special financial packages instead of SCS.
    3. Nagaland                                   :   Granted SCS in 1969.
    4. Sikkim                                     :   Currently receives special funding as per recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jammu and Kashmir, before its reorganization in 2019, was a special category state and received funds based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Nagaland was granted SCS in 1969, as mentioned in the text. Andhra Pradesh's demand for special financial packages instead of SCS is also correctly stated. However, Sikkim's current special funding is not based on the 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations regarding SCS, which were abolished. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect or incomplete information, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of historical context and current policies related to SCS. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring candidates to evaluate the accuracy of each pair based on their understanding of the nuances of SCS and its evolution.



**3. With reference to the  Indian Postal System, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Provision/Feature
    1.  DGPS                                      :   Power to make regulations on charges for services.
    2.  Government interception of postal articles :   Permitted only during wartime.
    3.  Liability of Post Office                  :   Absolutely no liability for any service provided.
    4.  First Indian Post Office                   :   Established in 1727 by the East India Company.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Director General of Posts (DGPS) does have the power to make regulations on charges for services. The establishment of the first post office in 1727 by the East India Company is also accurate. However, the other two pairs are incorrect. Government interception of postal articles is not limited to wartime; the text mentions several grounds, including national security and public order. The Post Office does have some liability for its services, although it may be limited.  Thus, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate a lack of complete understanding of the Indian Postal Act and its provisions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian postal system's historical context and current legal framework. The plausible distractors in options (b), (c), and (d) highlight the necessity for precise factual recall to answer correctly.


**4. With reference to the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Feature
    1.  Aim                                       :   To create a future-looking civil service focused solely on technological advancement.
    2.  Coverage                                  :   Includes all civil servants, including contractual employees.
    3.  Guiding Principle                         :   Shift from rule-based to role-based training.
    4.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)      :   Launched in 2020 as part of NPCSCB.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi's aim is to create a professional and future-ready civil service, encompassing a broader developmental vision than just technological advancement; therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The program's coverage includes all civil servants, including contractual employees, making pair 2 correct.  A shift from rule-based to role-based training is a guiding principle, making pair 3 correct.  However, the CBC was launched in 2021, not 2020, making pair 4 incorrect.  Thus, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) show incomplete or inaccurate understanding of Mission Karmayogi's objectives and implementation. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about a significant government initiative and differentiate between accurate and inaccurate statements, evaluating their knowledge of governance reforms. The distractors test the candidate's ability to critically analyze the information and identify the precise details.


**5. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Feature
    1.  Establishment                            :   Under the Ministry of Rural Development.
    2.  One of the three pillars of NeGP           :   National Data Bank/State Data Centres.
    3.  Services offered                          :   G2C services only.
    4.  Vision                                    :   To develop CSCs as a reliable and ubiquitous IT-enabled network.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CSCs are established under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development; therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  National Data Bank/State Data Centres are indeed one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), making pair 2 correct.  CSCs offer a wider range of services than just G2C (Government-to-Citizen), including B2C (Business-to-Citizen) and financial services, making pair 3 incorrect. The vision statement accurately reflects the goal of creating a widespread and reliable IT-enabled network, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) showcase an incomplete or inaccurate understanding of the CSC scheme and its functionalities. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of e-governance initiatives and their features, specifically focusing on CSCs.  The inclusion of plausible distractors emphasizes the need for precise factual recall and understanding of the program's scope.


**6.  With reference to the  Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Committee                                   Feature
    1.  Committee on Public Accounts (Lok Sabha):   Membership includes members from Rajya Sabha.
    2.  Committee on Estimates (Lok Sabha)     :   Examines the estimates included in the budget.
    3.  Department Related Parliamentary Standing Committees:   Scrutinize the working of government departments.
    4.  Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha)    :   Consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Committee on Public Accounts (Lok Sabha) consists only of Lok Sabha members; therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Committee on Estimates (Lok Sabha) does examine the estimates presented in the budget, making pair 2 correct. Department-Related Parliamentary Standing Committees scrutinize government departments, making pair 3 correct. The Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha) consists of 10 members, not 15, and they are nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman, making pair 4 incorrect. Hence, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) demonstrate a lack of precision in understanding the composition and functions of parliamentary committees. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Indian parliamentary system and its functioning.  The inclusion of plausible distractors emphasizes the need for precise factual recall and understanding of the committees' roles.


**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Feature
    1.  Current Framework                         :   Based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2016).
    2.  Funding                                   :   Transfers to states are routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.
    3.  Number of CSSs                           :   Currently, there are 70 CSSs.
    4.  Monitoring                                 :   Exclusively done by the NITI Aayog.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The current CSS framework is based on the 2015 report, not 2016, making pair 1 incorrect. Funding for CSSs is routed through the Consolidated Fund of *the State*, not India, making pair 2 incorrect.  The number of CSSs is mentioned as 75, not 70, making pair 3 incorrect.  NITI Aayog has concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring, not exclusive jurisdiction, making pair 4 incorrect. Only pair 1 is partially correct, as the report is from 2015.  Options (a), (b), and (c) demonstrate a lack of precise knowledge regarding CSSs' administrative aspects. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the administrative framework of centrally sponsored schemes in India.  The distractors highlight the need for precise knowledge of the facts and figures related to CSSs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                     Key Feature
1. Election Commission of India (ECI)       :   First introduced Model Code of Conduct in Kerala's state assembly elections in 1960
2. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)          :   Manufactures EVMs under the Ministry of Home Affairs
3. Electronic Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) :   Supplies VVPATs under the Department of Space


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) first introduced the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during Kerala's state assembly elections in 1960.  This is a well-established fact in Indian electoral history.  The MCC is a set of guidelines aimed at ensuring free and fair elections.

Option 2 is incorrect.  Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) manufactures EVMs, but it falls under the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Ministry of Home Affairs primarily deals with internal security, while the Ministry of Defence is responsible for the country's defence and armed forces. BEL's involvement in EVM production is a crucial aspect of India's electoral process, highlighting the technological advancements in election management.

Option 3 is also incorrect.  While ECIL is involved in supplying VVPATs, it operates under the Department of Atomic Energy, not the Department of Space. The Department of Atomic Energy focuses on nuclear energy and related technologies, whereas the Department of Space deals with space exploration and research.  The distinction between these departments is important to understand the organizational structure of government agencies in India.


**2. With reference to the Indian Financial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                   Function/Characteristic
1. Finance Commission                       :   Recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the union between the union and states based on Article 270.
2. 15th Finance Commission                 :   Allocated 41% of the divisible pool to states based on  criteria including Income Distance, Area, Population (2011), Demographic performance, Forest and Ecology, and Tax and fiscal efforts.
3. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution :   Grants state governments the power to borrow money both within and outside India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. The Finance Commission plays a pivotal role in the Indian federal system by recommending the vertical and horizontal devolution of resources between the Union and State governments.  Article 270 of the Constitution provides the constitutional basis for this crucial function.  The recommendations of the Finance Commission significantly influence the fiscal balance between the Centre and the States.

Pair 2 is also correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission indeed allocated 41% of the divisible pool to the states.  It employed a multi-faceted approach, considering various factors to ensure a more equitable distribution of resources among the states. The weighting assigned to different criteria reflects the Commission's attempt to balance various developmental needs and fiscal capacities of the states.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money *within* India, not outside. The restriction on borrowing from foreign sources is a crucial aspect of India's fiscal management, aimed at maintaining macroeconomic stability and preventing excessive external debt.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State/Union Territory                    Relevant Feature
1. Andhra Pradesh                           :   Demanded special financial packages recently.
2. Bihar                                    :   Demanded Special Category Status (SCS) recently.
3. 14th Finance Commission                  :   Recommended the continuation of SCS for states.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have recently demanded special financial assistance from the central government.  These demands highlight the ongoing debates about regional disparities and the need for equitable development in India.  The rationale behind these demands often involves arguments about historical disadvantages or specific developmental challenges faced by these states.

The 14th Finance Commission's recommendation was actually to discontinue the Special Category Status (SCS).  This decision marked a significant shift in the approach to providing financial assistance to states, moving towards a more performance-based and needs-based allocation of resources. The discontinuation of SCS does not mean that these states do not receive special funding, but the funding is provided based on other criteria and recommendations.



**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                Feature
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                       :   Declared Aadhaar mandatory for accessing all social welfare schemes
2. Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI judgment :   Affirmed the constitutionality of Aadhaar Act, 2016, but limited its mandatory use.
3. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Explicitly includes the "right to be forgotten".


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the Aadhaar Act allows for the use of Aadhaar in accessing social welfare schemes, the Supreme Court's judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI* clarified that it cannot be made *mandatory* for all schemes. The judgment emphasized the importance of balancing the government's interest in using Aadhaar for efficient service delivery with the fundamental right to privacy.

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The Supreme Court's judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI* upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but also imposed significant limitations on its use, notably concerning data protection and the right to privacy.  This decision underscores the importance of judicial review in safeguarding fundamental rights in the context of technological advancements.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 does not include the "right to be forgotten," a concept found in the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The absence of this right in Indian law reflects ongoing debates about data privacy and the balance between individual rights and the needs of the government and businesses.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                  Feature
1. NITI Aayog                             :   Initiated a process for revamping CSSs as part of expenditure reforms.
2. 14th Finance Commission                 :   Led to the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, making CSSs the primary mode of specific purpose transfers.
3. Funding Pattern for Core Schemes (North Eastern States) :   Centre:State ratio of 60:40


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched. NITI Aayog, the government's policy think tank, has played a key role in reviewing and reforming Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs). This reflects the government's ongoing efforts to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public spending.  The reforms aim to streamline the process, reduce overlap, and ensure better alignment with national priorities.

Pair 2 is also correctly matched. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish the Plan-Non Plan distinction in the budget had a profound impact on the structure of central government transfers to states.  The shift towards CSSs as the primary mode of specific purpose transfers reflects a move towards greater flexibility and efficiency in resource allocation.

Pair 3 is incorrect.  The funding pattern for core schemes in the eight North Eastern States and three Himalayan states is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 60:40. This differential funding pattern reflects the government's commitment to addressing the unique developmental challenges faced by these regions.  The higher central share underscores the need for greater support to bridge the development gap in these areas.


**6. With reference to the Indian Postal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Feature
1. Indian Post Office Act, 1898                 :   Established the Directorate General of Posts
2.  Department of Posts' Geographical areas      :   Divided into postal circles and sub-circles.
3.  Powers of Director General of Posts (DGPS)   :   Includes the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services, supply and sale of postage stamps, and intercepting postal articles on specified grounds


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. While the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, significantly shaped the Indian postal system, it did not establish the Directorate General of Posts. The Directorate General of Posts evolved over time as the postal system expanded and its functions became more complex.

Pair 2 is correctly matched. The Department of Posts is indeed divided into postal circles and sub-circles for efficient management and service delivery.  This geographical division facilitates better coordination and monitoring of postal operations across the country.

Pair 3 is correctly matched. The Director General of Posts (DGPS) does have the powers mentioned. These powers are essential for regulating the postal system, ensuring fair pricing, and maintaining the security of postal articles.  The power to intercept postal articles, however, is subject to specific legal grounds and safeguards to protect fundamental rights.


**7. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Feature
1. NHRC                                        :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and headquartered in Mumbai.
2. Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) :   Accredits National Human Rights Institutions based on their compliance with the Paris Principles.
3.  NHRC's Accreditation Status                :  Currently holds an 'A' status accreditation from GANHRI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, but its headquarters is in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  The location of the headquarters is a crucial piece of information for understanding the organization's administrative structure and reach.

Pair 2 is correctly matched. GANHRI, a UN-linked alliance, indeed accredits National Human Rights Institutions (NHRIs) based on their adherence to the Paris Principles, a set of international standards for NHRIs.  This accreditation process aims to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of NHRIs worldwide.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The NHRC's accreditation from GANHRI has been deferred, not an 'A' status. This highlights the ongoing concerns about the NHRC's performance and compliance with international standards. The deferral underscores the importance of continuous evaluation and improvement in the work of human rights institutions.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                           Key Feature
1. Mission Karmayogi                         :   Aims to create a professional, well-trained civil service based on a role-based approach to training.
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                        :   Focuses on accelerating people’s participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)
3.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)       :   Launched as part of National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) in 2022.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correctly matched.  Mission Karmayogi is a significant initiative aimed at modernizing the Indian civil service by shifting from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building.  This approach emphasizes competency development and aligning the civil service with the country's developmental goals.

Pair 2 is also correctly matched. Jan Yojana Abhiyan is designed to enhance the participation of citizens in the planning and implementation of local development programs at the Panchayat level.  This participatory approach aims to ensure that development plans are more responsive to local needs and priorities.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was launched in 2021, not 2022, as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), which is a key component of Mission Karmayogi.  The CBC plays a crucial role in designing and implementing capacity-building programs for civil servants.


**1. With reference to the President's powers regarding mercy petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Power Granted
1. Article 72                               :  Grant pardons for offences under state laws only
2. Article 72                               :  Commute death sentences
3. Article 142                              :  Oversee the President's pardon power
4. Article 280                              :  Adjudicate on mercy petitions in cases of national security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense. This includes offences against Union laws and death sentences.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  Article 142 deals with the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, it doesn't oversee presidential pardon powers. Article 280 deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission, not mercy petitions.  Pair 1 is incorrect as Article 72 encompasses offences under both Union and State laws. Pair 4 is completely unrelated.  Option (b) is the only correct choice because it accurately reflects the power granted to the President under Article 72 concerning the commutation of death sentences.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                  Description
1. Review Petition (Article 137)              :  Filed after a curative petition is dismissed.
2. Curative Petition                           :  Last available constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal.
3. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction        :  Used to interpret conflicting provisions in the Limitation Act, in relation to curative petitions.
4. Principles of Natural Justice               :  Violation can be a ground for a curative petition.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after their review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  This makes pair 2 correct.  A violation of principles of natural justice, such as a judge failing to disclose a conflict of interest, can be grounds for a curative petition, making pair 4 correct.  Pair 1 is incorrect because a review petition is filed *before* a curative petition, not after.  While the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction might be relevant in legal interpretation generally, its direct connection to curative petitions is not established in the provided context. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (d) incorrectly includes pairs 1 and 3.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

   Court Type                                 Characteristic
1. FTSC                                      :  Exclusively handles cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. ePOCSO Courts                            :  A type of FTSC.
3. FTSCs                                     :  Funded entirely by state governments.
4. National Judicial Data Grid                :  FTSCs are not linked to this system.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While FTSCs handle cases under the POCSO Act, they are not exclusively limited to these cases; they also address rape cases.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  ePOCSO Courts are indeed a type of FTSC, making pair 2 correct.  FTSCs are centrally sponsored schemes, funded from the Nirbhaya Fund, not solely by state governments.  Thus, pair 3 is incorrect.  FTSCs are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid, contradicting pair 4. Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**4.  With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Detail
1. Spectrum Allocation                          : Primarily through auction, with some administrative allocation for specified purposes.
2. Right of Way (RoW) framework               :  Granted on a discriminatory and exclusive basis.
3. Digital Bharat Nidhi                         :  Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund.
4. Regulation of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms :  Regulated under the Telecommunications Act, 2023.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, does indeed primarily allocate spectrum through auctions, with administrative allocation for specific purposes like national security.  This makes pair 1 correct.  The Universal Service Obligation Fund is replaced by the Digital Bharat Nidhi under the Act, making pair 3 correct.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the RoW framework is explicitly stated to be granted on a *non-discriminatory* and *non-exclusive* basis.  The Act does *not* regulate OTT platforms, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1. Aim                                        : To decrease people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. Launch Year                               : 2018
3. Implementation                             : Involves elected representatives, government workers, and community organizations.
4. Panchayat Development Index (PDI)          :  Used to identify thematic developmental gaps.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to *increase* people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans, making pair 1 incorrect. The Abhiyan was launched in 2018, making pair 2 correct. Its implementation does involve various stakeholders including elected representatives, government workers, and community organizations, making pair 3 correct.  The PDI is used to identify thematic developmental gaps to be addressed in the plans, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Characteristic
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): First of its kind in India.
2. iCAL                                         : Aims to set global standards for auditing central government bodies.
3. Ministry of Panchayati Raj                    :  Directly oversees the functioning of iCAL.
4.  iCAL                                        : Located in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is indeed the first of its kind in India, making pair 1 correct.  However, iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing *local governance* bodies, not central government bodies, making pair 2 incorrect.  While the Ministry of Panchayati Raj might be involved, direct oversight is not explicitly stated, making pair 3 uncertain and therefore incorrect.  iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                    Description
1. Vertical Devolution                         :  Distribution among states from their allocated share.
2. Horizontal Devolution                      :  States' share from the divisible pool of taxes.
3. Article 270                               :  Recommendation of Finance Commission for tax distribution between Union and States.
4. Grants-in-Aid                              : Provided to states under Article 275.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes, making pair 2 incorrect. Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution among states from their allocated share, making pair 1 incorrect. Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union between the Union and the States, based on Finance Commission recommendations, making pair 3 correct. Grants-in-aid are provided to states under Article 275, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Characteristic
1. Bihar                                      : Granted SCS in 1969.
2. Andhra Pradesh                             : Currently holds SCS.
3. Jammu & Kashmir                           : Granted SCS in 1969.
4. Nagaland                                   : Granted SCS after 1969.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have *demanded* SCS but are not currently granted it, making pairs 1 and 2 incorrect.  Jammu & Kashmir was granted SCS in 1969, making pair 3 correct. Nagaland was also granted SCS, but the exact year is not specified in the text; however, it was granted after 1969, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1. Administration                             : Under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. Cantonment Act, 2006                      :  Governs the administration of cantonments.
3. First Cantonment established                : Barrackpore in 1765.
4. Number of Cantonments in India             : 70

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cantonments are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, making pair 1 incorrect.  The Cantonment Act, 2006, does govern the administration of cantonments, making pair 2 correct.  The first cantonment was indeed established at Barrackpore in 1765, making pair 3 correct.  There are 61 cantonments in India, not 70, making pair 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change and fundamental rights, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Interpretation
1. Article 14                                :  Guarantees the right to a healthy environment.
2. Article 21                                :  Includes the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change.
3. Article 19                                :  Specifically mentions the right to protest against climate change policies.
4.  Writ Petition 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others'  : Related to protection of Great Indian Bustard.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While Article 14 guarantees equality, its direct connection to a right to a healthy environment is not explicitly stated in the given context, making pair 1 uncertain. Article 21, the right to life, was interpreted to include the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change, making pair 2 correct.  Article 19, while related to freedoms, doesn't specifically mention climate change protests, making pair 3 incorrect.  The writ petition 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' was indeed related to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                      Prominent Feature
1. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                 :   Replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023
2. CrPC 1973                                  :   Forensic investigation mandatory for offences punishable with at least seven years imprisonment
3. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, explicitly replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, modernizing the legal framework for evidence admissibility.  The CrPC 1973, a significant piece of legislation governing criminal procedure, mandates forensic investigation for serious crimes, reflecting a focus on scientific evidence in criminal justice. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI as a crucial regulatory body overseeing the processing of digital personal data, underscoring the growing importance of data protection in the digital age.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  A thorough understanding of Indian legal frameworks is crucial for answering this question accurately.


**2. With reference to the Indian legal system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Remedy                                 Description
1. Mercy Petition                               :   Granted by the Supreme Court under Article 137
2. Curative Petition                             :   Last constitutional remedy available after review petition dismissal
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)           :   Exclusively handle cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court, stemming from Article 142's power to ensure complete justice.  Pair 1 is incorrect because mercy petitions are granted by the President of India under Article 72, not the Supreme Court under Article 137.  Pair 3 is partially incorrect; while FTSCs significantly expedite rape and POCSO Act cases, they don't exclusively handle only POCSO cases;  they also handle rape cases.  Understanding the distinct roles and jurisdictions of different legal remedies within the Indian judicial system is essential for this question.


**3. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                        Detail
1. Governing Act                               :   The Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946
2. Selection of Director                       :   A panel comprising the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India
3. Constitutional Status                         :   A constitutional body established under the Indian Constitution

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The CBI is governed by the DSPE Act, 1946, and its director is selected by a panel consisting of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.  Pair 3 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body. It operates under the DSPE Act, not the Constitution.  Understanding the organizational structure and legal basis of the CBI is crucial to differentiate between its statutory and constitutional aspects.


**4. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                    Detail
1. Coordinating Agency                         :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2. Time Frame for Providing Information        :   Within 30 days, or 48 hours for life or liberty matters
3. Exemptions from Disclosure                   :   Specified in Section 8, including certain intelligence and security information

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The RTI Act mandates a 30-day timeframe for information requests, with a 48-hour deadline for matters concerning life or liberty.  Section 8 of the Act details specific exemptions from disclosure, primarily for national security and sensitive information.  Pair 1 is incorrect. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act is the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Understanding the nuances of the RTI Act's provisions, including its timelines and exemptions, is essential for a correct response.


**5.  With reference to the Aadhaar system, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1. Issuing Authority                           :   National Informatics Centre (NIC)
2. Uniqueness                                 :   12-digit unique identification number linked to individual biometrics
3. Deactivation/Omission                       :   Can be done by the individual only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Aadhaar numbers are indeed 12-digit unique identifiers linked to individual biometric data.  Pair 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), not the NIC.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; while individuals can request deactivation or omission, UIDAI also retains the authority to do so.  The question tests knowledge about the Aadhaar system's architecture and operational aspects.


**6. With reference to data protection in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Concept                                 Feature
1. Right to be Forgotten                       :   Explicitly mentioned in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
2. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Applies to processing of digital personal data within India only
3. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)       :   Appeals against its decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Appeals against the DPBI's decisions indeed go to TDSAT. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Right to be Forgotten is not explicitly mentioned in the DPDP Act, 2023. Pair 2 is incorrect; the DPDP Act applies to data processed within India and also outside if it's for offering goods or services in India.  This question tests the understanding of data protection laws in India and their scope.


**7. With reference to the Indian legal system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                 Description
1.  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996     :   Governs only international commercial arbitrations
2.  New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019 :   Facilitates institutional arbitration
3.  Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)       :   Established by the UNCITRAL Model Law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, does indeed facilitate institutional arbitration in India. Pair 1 is incorrect; the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, covers both domestic and international commercial arbitrations. Pair 3 is incorrect; the PCA was established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes in 1899, not by the UNCITRAL Model Law.  The question assesses the knowledge of different legal frameworks related to dispute resolution.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                           Feature
1.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan                         :   Launched by the Ministry of Rural Development
2.  People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)              :   Aims to accelerate people’s participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Second such center in India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The People’s Plan Campaign (PPC), also known as Jan Yojana Abhiyan, aims to enhance participation in creating Panchayat Development Plans.  Pair 1 is incorrect; it's launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Pair 3 is incorrect; iCAL is the first such center in India.  This question tests knowledge of governance initiatives at the local level.  Understanding the objectives and implementing ministries of various schemes is crucial for answering this correctly.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 72                      :   President's power to grant pardons
2. Article 137                     :   Review petitions in Supreme Court
3. Article 142                     :   Supreme Court's power to do complete justice
4. Article 280                     :   Establishment of Finance Commission
5. Article 282                     :   Discretionary grants by Centre and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 explicitly grants the President of India the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences, including death sentences.  Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments.  Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, a crucial provision allowing for broader equitable actions. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States.  Finally, Article 282 permits the central and state governments to make grants for any public purpose, providing flexibility in financial assistance.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                       Key Feature
1.  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Requires Aadhaar submission from NGO office-bearers
2.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)     :   Funded by Nirbhaya Fund
3.  Post Office Act, 2023               :   Repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998
4.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The FCRA, post-2020 amendments, mandates Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers.  FTSCs are indeed centrally sponsored schemes funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.  The Post Office Act, 2023, explicitly repeals the 1998 Act. Finally, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI to oversee data protection.  Option (d) is therefore the correct answer, correctly matching all four pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Commission                  Characteristic
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):  Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Appoints officers to various central government posts
3.  Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)     :  Deals with corruption in government
4.  Law Commission of India             :   Advises the government on legal reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. The UPSC is responsible for recruiting and appointing officers to various central government services. The CVC is tasked with combating corruption within the government. The Law Commission of India provides crucial advice to the government on legal reforms and law-related matters. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Act/Legislation                         Key Provision
1. Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1973 :   Mandates forensic investigation for certain offenses
2. Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 :   Allows oral evidence to be given electronically
3. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005 :   Provides citizens access to information from public authorities
4. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :  Grants data principals the right to data erasure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The CrPC, 1973, includes provisions mandating forensic investigation for offenses with a minimum sentence of seven years. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, modernizes evidence admissibility, including allowing electronic oral evidence. The RTI Act, 2005, gives citizens the right to access information held by public authorities.  Finally, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly grants data principals the right to have their personal data erased under certain conditions. Option (d), therefore, is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Policy                     Description
1.  Mercy Petition                     :   President's power under Article 72
2.  Curative Petition                  :   Last constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal
3.  Special Category Status (SCS)     :   No constitutional basis, ceased to exist after 14th Finance Commission
4.  Sixth Schedule                      :   Provides for autonomous district councils in certain states
5.  Special Financial Packages       :   Discretionary grants under Article 282


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Mercy petitions are handled by the President under Article 72 of the Constitution. Curative petitions are the final legal recourse available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.  Special Category Status, while previously used, has no constitutional basis and was discontinued after the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations. The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states. Finally, special financial packages are indeed discretionary grants that fall under Article 282's provision for miscellaneous financial provisions. Option (c), therefore, is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**1. With reference to Constitutional Provisions related to the President's Powers, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                       Power Granted
    1. Article 72                                : Power to grant pardons in cases of offences against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union
    2. Article 142                               : Power to issue curative petitions
    3. Article 137                               : Power to review a Supreme Court judgment
    4. Article 22                                : Power to make laws on preventive detention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense. This power extends to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial, for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a death sentence.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, which includes the power to pass curative petitions as a last resort.  However, the power is inherent in the Supreme Court's jurisdiction, not explicitly mentioned in Article 142 itself. Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power of review of its own judgments, not directly related to the President's powers.  Article 22 allows for the Parliament and State Legislatures to create laws regarding preventive detention, a separate subject from the President's pardoning power. Therefore, only pair 1 and 4 are accurately matched.  Pairs 2 and 3 represent a misunderstanding of the constitutional provisions.


**2. With reference to the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                     Detail
    1. Type of Scheme                           : Centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019
    2. Funding Source                            : Nirbhaya Fund
    3. Implementing Ministry                    : Ministry of Home Affairs
    4. Primary Objective                         : Swift disposal of POCSO Act cases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs are indeed a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 and extended until 2026 (pair 1).  The funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund (pair 2).  Their primary objective is the swift disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act (pair 4). However, the implementing ministry is the Department of Justice, under the Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs (pair 3).  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair 3. Only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Internet Shutdowns in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                      Detail
    1. Governing Legislation                     : Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
    2. Rules for Suspension                      : Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017
    3. Authority for Issuing Orders              :  District Magistrates
    4. Supreme Court Ruling (Anuradha Bhasin): Indefinite suspension is permissible

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Internet shutdowns in India are primarily governed by the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 (pairs 1 and 2).  The Supreme Court ruling in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India explicitly stated that indefinite suspension of internet services is impermissible.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrect.  Orders for temporary suspension are issued by the Union/State Home Secretary, not District Magistrates (pair 3).  Consequently, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.



**4. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                       Detail
    1. Establishment Year                         : 2006
    2. Overseeing Body                           : CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)
    3. Parent Ministry                            : Ministry of Electronics & IT
    4. One of the Pillars of NeGP                 : National Data Bank/State Data Centres

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CSC SPV oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme (pair 2), and the Ministry of Electronics & IT set up the CSC SPV (pair 3). However, CSCs are one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) approved in 2006, not established in 2006 itself (pair 1).  The other two pillars include Connectivity and National Data Bank/State Data Centres (pair 4).  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 4 are incorrect due to a misunderstanding of the timeline and components of NeGP.


**5. With reference to Affirmative Action in India and the US, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                      India                                  US
    1. Constitutional Basis                     : Explicitly provided for                  Not explicitly enshrined but permitted under 14th Amendment
    2. Primary Targeted Groups                  : Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes   African Americans, Hispanics, Asian Americans
    3. System                                     : Quota System                           Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) programs
    4. Legal Upper Ceiling on Reservations     : 50%                                     No legal upper limit

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution explicitly provides for affirmative action through Articles 15(4) and 16(4), while the US Constitution doesn't explicitly mention it but allows for it through interpretations of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment (pair 1).  In India, affirmative action primarily targets Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, along with other Backward Classes, while in the US, it focuses on historically disadvantaged groups like African Americans, Hispanics, and Asian Americans (pair 2). India primarily uses a quota system, while the US employs DEI programs (pair 3).  The Supreme Court of India has set a 50% upper limit on reservations, while there's no such legal limit in the US (pair 4). All the pairs are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 72                     :   Power of the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences
2. Article 137                    :   Review petitions in the Supreme Court
3. Article 142                    :   Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice
4. Article 215                    :   Power of High Courts to punish for contempt of court
5. Article 282                    :   Power of the Centre and states to make grants for any public purpose

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute sentences, including death sentences. Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments, forming the basis for review petitions.  Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice, a power often invoked in curative petitions. Article 215 bestows upon High Courts the power to punish for contempt. Finally, Article 282 provides the constitutional basis for discretionary grants by both the central and state governments for public purposes, often seen in special financial packages for states.  There is no mismatch or inaccuracy in any of the provided pairs.


**2. With reference to the Indian judicial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Petition                Court/Remedy
1. Mercy Petition                  :   High Court
2. Curative Petition               :   Supreme Court
3. Contempt Petition              :   Supreme Court or High Court
4. Review Petition                 :   Supreme Court
5. Appeal against CAT order        :   High Court only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mercy petitions are addressed to the President of India, not the High Court. Curative petitions are a final remedy available in the Supreme Court. Contempt petitions can be filed in either the Supreme Court or High Courts, depending on the nature of the contempt. Review petitions are indeed filed in the Supreme Court. Appeals against Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) orders primarily lie with the Supreme Court, not High Courts, as clarified by a Supreme Court judgment. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Key Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                      :   Establishes courts at the intermediate panchayat headquarters
2. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                   :   Defines civil and criminal contempt
3. Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act :   Deals with sexual offences against children
4. Cantonments Act, 2006                         :   Governs the administration of cantonment boards
5. Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985             :   Establishes the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes village-level courts. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines various types of contempt of court. The POCSO Act deals specifically with sexual offenses against children. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonment areas.  The Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985,  established the CAT.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to special provisions for states in the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Scheme                         Characteristic
1. Special Category Status (SCS)         :   Continues to be granted to states based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
2. Sixth Schedule Areas                    :   Covers specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
3. Article 371(A) to 371(J)               :   Provides special provisions for several states, including Nagaland and Sikkim
4. Special Financial Packages              :   Granted only to states facing geographical and socio-economic challenges
5. Fifth Schedule Areas                    :   Administered by Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that SCS continues to be granted based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS.  The Sixth Schedule correctly identifies the areas it covers.  Articles 371(A) to 371(J) indeed provide special provisions for various states. Special financial packages are not restricted to states with geographical and socio-economic challenges but are discretionary and may be granted for various reasons. The Fifth Schedule areas are indeed administered by TACs. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Initiative                     Objective/Feature
1. Mission Karmayogi                      :   Focuses solely on technical skill development for government officials
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                      :   Aims to reduce people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation
3. Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM)  :   Includes a Citizen’s Charter and Capability Building for Service Delivery
4. Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) Karmayogi Platform :  Monitors and evaluates performance of users on key performance indicators
5. Auditing of Local Bodies                :   Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi is a broader initiative focusing on capacity building and not limited to technical skills. Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to *increase* people's participation. The GRM includes the elements mentioned. The iGOT platform does monitor and evaluate performance.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to set global standards. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                     Status under Foreigners Act, 1963
1. Arunachal Pradesh                       : Entirely a Protected Area
2. Sikkim                                  : Partly Restricted Area, Partly Protected Area
3. Jammu & Kashmir                         : Entirely a Protected Area
4. Andaman & Nicobar Islands               : Entirely a Restricted Area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, and the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, delineate specific areas within India where the entry and stay of foreigners are regulated.  Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands fall under these regulations.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area,  Sikkim has a portion designated as a Restricted Area and another as a Protected Area, and the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely a Restricted Area.  Jammu & Kashmir, while having protected areas, isn't entirely designated as such under these specific orders.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is partially correct but misses the entirely restricted status of the Andaman & Nicobar Islands. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits Arunachal Pradesh’s entirely protected status. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes Jammu & Kashmir incorrectly as entirely designated under the Foreigners Act.  The question tests factual recall regarding the specific legal designations of different Indian states concerning foreign entry restrictions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision              Aspect of Fiscal Federalism Addressed
1. Article 246                             :  Distribution of revenue between Union and States based on 15th FC recommendations
2. Article 269-A                           :  Levy and Collection of GST in Inter-State Trade
3. Article 280                             : Establishes the Finance Commission
4. Article 275                             :  Grants-in-Aid to States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 246 of the Indian Constitution deals with the legislative powers of the Union and the States, defining the tax bases for each. While revenue distribution is a consequence, it is not directly addressed in this article.  Article 269-A explicitly deals with the levy and collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in inter-state trade or commerce. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and the States. Finally, Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid from the Union to the States.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is partially correct but omits the crucial role of Article 280. Option (b) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the inaccurate pairing of Article 246 with revenue distribution based on 15th FC recommendations. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the mismatched pair of Article 246.  This question tests knowledge of specific constitutional provisions related to fiscal federalism in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                                   Special Status/Provision
1. Bihar                                      : Special Category Status (SCS)
2. Andhra Pradesh                           : Special Financial Package
3. Nagaland                                  : Special Category Status (SCS)
4. Ladakh                                    : Sixth Schedule inclusion


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The demand for special status or financial packages from states like Bihar and Andhra Pradesh highlights the complexities of Centre-State relations in India.  Andhra Pradesh has indeed sought a special financial package, while Nagaland previously held Special Category Status (SCS), which no longer exists after the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations. Ladakh’s inclusion in the Sixth Schedule is a currently debated issue. Bihar's demand for SCS is outdated since the 14th Finance Commission abolished the SCS categorization. Therefore, only Andhra Pradesh’s demand for a special financial package and Ladakh’s potential inclusion in the Sixth Schedule remain accurate. Option (b) incorrectly includes Nagaland. Option (c) incorrectly includes Bihar. Option (d) is entirely incorrect. The question assesses understanding of the political and administrative realities related to special status provisions and financial assistance to states.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Order                                   Key Feature/Provision
1. Cantonments Act, 2006                     : Administered by Cantonment Boards under Ministry of Defence
2. Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958 :  Regulates entry of foreigners in areas between the inner line and international borders
3. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts : Provisions on local self-governance
4.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 : Includes the ‘right to be forgotten’


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments in India, with Cantonment Boards responsible for civic duties under the Ministry of Defence.  The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, regulates foreign entry into specific regions. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts introduced provisions for local self-governance in India. However, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, notably does *not* include the "right to be forgotten," a provision found in other jurisdictions like the European Union's GDPR.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (b) omits the correct pairing of the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts. Option (c) omits the correct pairing of the Cantonments Act. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, with the ‘right to be forgotten’. This question tests knowledge of various Indian laws and constitutional provisions concerning governance, administration, and data protection.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 72                       :   Power of the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences
2. Article 137                      :   Review petitions in the Supreme Court
3. Article 142                      :   Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice
4. Article 244(2)                   :   Establishment of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
5. Article 282                      :   Discretionary grants by the Centre and states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense, including those sentenced to death.  This power is a crucial aspect of executive clemency. Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments, allowing for reconsideration of decisions.  Article 142 provides the Supreme Court with the power to ensure complete justice, enabling it to issue orders necessary for the effective execution of its judgments. Article 244(2) forms the basis for the establishment and functioning of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in certain states, primarily in the Northeast.  Article 282 empowers both the central and state governments to make grants for any public purpose, even if it falls outside their legislative powers; this is often used for special financial packages. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Remedy                     Description
1. Mercy Petition                  :   A petition to the President for clemency in a death sentence case
2. Curative Petition                :   Last resort legal remedy after review petition dismissal in the Supreme Court
3. Contempt of Court                :   Wilful disobedience to court orders, defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
4. Review Petition                  :   A petition to review a Supreme Court judgment
5. Gram Nyayalaya                  :   A court established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, to settle petty disputes.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A mercy petition is a plea made to the President of India for pardon or commutation of a sentence, often in capital punishment cases.  A curative petition is a last resort for those whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court. Contempt of court is an offense against the authority of a court, encompassing both civil and criminal contempt, and is governed by the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Review petitions are a mechanism within the Supreme Court's system for reviewing its own judgments. Gram Nyayalayas are village-level courts established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, with jurisdiction over minor civil and criminal disputes.  All five pairs accurately reflect the legal remedies and their descriptions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Order/Regulation           Key Feature
1. Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873  :   Genesis of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system
2. Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958     :   Declaration of Protected Areas in certain states
3. Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963    :   Declaration of Restricted Areas, including Andaman & Nicobar Islands
4. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                 :   Establishment of village-level courts
5. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Includes the "right to be forgotten"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 laid the foundation for the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in certain regions of Northeast India. The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, established the framework for designating Protected Areas within various states, restricting access to certain regions. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, further defined Restricted Areas, notably including the entire Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, led to the creation of village-level courts to handle minor disputes. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* include the "right to be forgotten," a provision found in other jurisdictions like the European Union's GDPR.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct matches.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court                Jurisdiction
1. Supreme Court               :   Final appellate jurisdiction in civil and criminal matters
2. High Courts                   :   Appellate jurisdiction over subordinate courts within their respective states
3. Gram Nyayalayas              :   Jurisdiction over petty civil and criminal disputes at the village level
4. Fast-Track Special Courts     :   Primarily handle rape and POCSO Act cases
5. Court of Session              :   Jurisdiction over appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court of India serves as the apex court with final appellate jurisdiction in both civil and criminal cases. High Courts have appellate jurisdiction over lower courts within their respective states or union territories. Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, deal with petty civil and criminal matters at the village level. Fast-Track Special Courts are specifically designed to expedite the handling of rape cases and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Courts of Session hear appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases. Consequently, all the pairs are accurately matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/Union Territory          Special Constitutional Provision
1. Nagaland                        :   Sixth Schedule
2. Jammu & Kashmir                :   Article 370 (previously)
3. Telangana                       :   Article 3
4. Sikkim                           :   Article 371F
5. Arunachal Pradesh               :   Sixth Schedule


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nagaland falls under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which grants it special autonomous status. Jammu and Kashmir previously operated under Article 370, which granted it special autonomy (now repealed).  Telangana was formed under the provisions of Article 3 of the Constitution, which deals with the formation of new states and alteration of boundaries. Sikkim has special provisions under Article 371F. Arunachal Pradesh also falls under the Sixth Schedule. Therefore, all the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Provision/Feature
1. Post Office Act, 2023                         :   Repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998
2. Post Office Act, 2023                         :   Establishes the office of Director General of Postal Services
3. Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993 :   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
4. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Requires Aadhaar submission from NGO office-bearers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Post Office Act, 2023, indeed repeals the 1998 Act and establishes the position of Director General of Postal Services (DGPS).  The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is the foundational legislation for the NHRC.  Finally, post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers.  All four pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the act/amendment and its key provision or feature. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of Indian legislation related to postal services, human rights, and foreign contributions is necessary to correctly answer this question.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of the interlinkages between legislation and institutional structures.


**2. With reference to Indian Governance, consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                          Key Function/Power
1.  Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) :   Can intercept postal articles on grounds of national security
2.  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)  :   Directly reports to the Parliament
3.  Finance Commission                          :   Recommends the distribution of taxes between the Union and States
4.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)     :   Appoints judges to the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The DGPS, as per the Post Office Act, 2023, has the power to make regulations, including on charges for services and the sale of stamps, and indirectly the power to intercept mail under specific circumstances related to national security. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in the vertical and horizontal devolution of resources between the Union and States. Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair related to DGPS. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect because the NHRC is a statutory body, not directly reporting to Parliament, and the UPSC does not appoint Supreme Court judges (that's the President's prerogative, advised by the Collegium).  This question assesses understanding of the roles and functions of various key governance bodies in India and demands precise knowledge of their powers.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Characteristic Feature
1.  Right to Information Act, 2005              :   Exempts all personal information from disclosure
2.  Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 :   Amended Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act
3.  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Prohibits receipt of foreign funds under certain conditions
4.  Post Office Act, 2023                        :   Prescribes penal provisions for violating its regulations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The DPDP Act, 2023, did indeed amend Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act to further restrict the disclosure of personal information. The FCRA does have provisions that prohibit the receipt of foreign funds under specific circumstances. Option (b) is incorrect because the Post Office Act, 2023, doesn't include penal provisions. Option (c) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair related to FCRA. Option (d) is incorrect because the RTI Act does not exempt *all* personal information from disclosure; there are specific provisions and exemptions. This question requires a detailed understanding of specific provisions within various acts, highlighting the complexity of Indian legislation and the evolving landscape of data protection and transparency.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitutional Framework, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                         Provision/Subject Matter
1. Article 72                                    :   Deals with the power of the President to grant pardons
2. Article 280                                   :   Relates to the establishment of the National Human Rights Commission
3. Article 244(2)                               :   Concerns the Sixth Schedule
4. Article 282                                   :   Empowers the Centre to make discretionary grants to States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution correctly outlines the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences. Article 244(2) correctly deals with the Sixth Schedule, which provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states. Article 282 correctly empowers both the Union and State governments to make grants for any public purpose. Option (b) is incorrect as it excludes the correctly matched pair related to Article 244(2). Option (c) is incorrect because Article 280 relates to the Finance Commission, not the NHRC. Option (d) is incorrect because Article 280 is incorrectly paired. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific articles within the Indian Constitution and their corresponding provisions.  The ability to accurately recall and associate articles with their subject matter is crucial for success in the UPSC examination.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Institution                     Specific Power/Function
1.  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)          :   Appoints judges to the Supreme Court
2.  Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) :   Hears appeals against DPBI decisions
3.  Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) :   Issues Aadhaar cards
4.  Ministry of Electronics & IT                   :   Oversees the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The TDSAT indeed hears appeals against DPBI decisions. UIDAI is responsible for issuing Aadhaar cards. The Ministry of Electronics & IT oversees the CSC scheme.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair related to the Ministry of Electronics & IT. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes the pair related to DPBI and incorrectly excludes the Ministry of Electronics & IT. Option (d) is incorrect because the DPBI does not appoint Supreme Court judges. This question tests knowledge of the roles and functions of various government bodies and institutions involved in data protection, digital identity, and service delivery.  It assesses the ability to connect specific institutions with their mandated responsibilities.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2020 Amendment :  Prior permission for foreign funds with mandatory Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers.
2. Post Office Act, 2023                              :   Repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998.
3. Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023    :  Establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI).
4. Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024 :  Specifies penalties for various offences related to data breaches.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The 2020 amendment to the FCRA introduced mandatory Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers and requires prior permission for receiving foreign funds.  The Post Office Act, 2023, explicitly repealed the 1998 Act, signifying a significant change in postal regulations. The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, indeed establishes the DPBI to oversee data protection and compliance.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, deal with preventing cheating in public exams, not data breaches; penalties for data breaches are specified under the DPDP Act. Options (a) and (c) are partially correct but incomplete, missing crucial elements of the correct pairings.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are accurately matched.


**2. With reference to the Indian financial framework, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision/Entity                         Feature
1. Article 270                                          :  Distribution of taxes between Union and States
2. 15th Finance Commission                             :   41% share of divisible pool allocated to states.
3. Article 293                                          :  States can borrow money from foreign sources.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  The 15th Finance Commission's recommendation of a 41% share of the divisible pool for states is a well-established fact.  However, Article 293 allows state governments to borrow *within* India, not from foreign sources. This makes option (d) incorrect.  Options (b) and (c) are incomplete as they omit one of the correctly matched pairs. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Policy                                          Governing Body/Ministry
1. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005                 :   Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions
2. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA)         :   Ministry of Home Affairs
3. National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)                   :   Ministry of Electronics & IT


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act. The Ministry of Home Affairs implements the FCRA.  The Ministry of Electronics & IT played a key role in the development and implementation of the NeGP. All three pairs are correctly matched, thus making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to governance bodies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Body                                              Key Function/Characteristic
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)           :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
2. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)                :   Oversees the implementation of the Right to Information Act.
3. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)            :   Conducts examinations for recruitment to civil services.
4. State Finance Commission                          :   Deals with auditing of local governance bodies.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The NHRC is indeed established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. The UPSC conducts civil services examinations.  However, the CVC's role is not related to implementing the RTI Act; that's primarily the responsibility of the Department of Personnel and Training.  Further, State Finance Commissions primarily deal with resource allocation between the state government and local bodies, not auditing (though they might indirectly influence it). Thus only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                                 Primary Focus/Objective
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Capacity building for auditors of local governance.
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                                   :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
3. Common Service Centres (CSC) SPV                    :   Oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme.
4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)                        :  Sets global standards for auditing local governance bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The iCAL aims to build capacity among local governance auditors. Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on preparing PDPs. The CSC SPV oversees the CSC scheme's implementation.  The UPU is a global organization related to postal services, not directly involved in setting auditing standards for local governance. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 4. Options (b) and (c) are incomplete and therefore also incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Court Ruling (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI)
1. Aadhaar metadata storage duration          :   More than six months
2. Violation of fundamental rights (Articles 14, 15, 19, 21) :   Affirmed
3. Aadhaar mandatory for bank accounts        :   Mandatory
4. Private corporation data sharing           :   Permitted

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, but with crucial stipulations.  Option 2 correctly reflects that the court found the Act did not violate fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21. However, the court imposed significant limitations.  Option 1 is incorrect; the court ruled that Aadhaar metadata could not be stored for more than six months. Option 3 is incorrect because the court explicitly stated that Aadhaar could not be forced for opening bank accounts or mobile/internet connections.  Option 4 is also incorrect; the court prohibited the state from entering into contracts with private corporations for Aadhaar data sharing, emphasizing the right to privacy.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects a single correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                         Characteristic
1. Funding Source                               :   Solely Central Government
2. Constitutional Basis                          :   Union List only
3. Implementation Agency                       :   Central Government Ministries
4. Current Framework Basis                     :   Report by Sub-Group of Chief Ministers (2015)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Centrally Sponsored Schemes are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.  They are implemented through states in sectors falling under both State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, making option 2 incorrect. Implementation is done through state governments, not solely central ministries, making option 3 incorrect. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Detail
1. Illegal Migrants Exempted                    :   Those from Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and China
2. Naturalization Period Reduction             :   From 11 years to 5 years for specified groups
3. Exempted from Adverse Penal Consequences   :   Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and Foreigners Act, 1946
4. Grounds for OCI Registration Cancellation  :   Ten grounds specified

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CAA, 2019, exempts specific groups of illegal migrants, but these are from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, not Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and China. Thus, option 1 is incorrect.  The Act did reduce the naturalization period for specified migrants from 11 years to 5 years, making option 2 correct.  The CAA exempts specified migrants from the penal consequences of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 and the Foreigners Act, 1946, making option 3 correct.  The Act lists five, not ten, grounds for OCI registration cancellation, thus making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                         Application
1. Article 72                                  :   Pardon for offences against state laws only
2.  Article 72                                  :   Commutation of death sentences
3.  Article 142                               :   Granting mercy petitions
4. Article 142                               :   Power to do complete justice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, including death sentences. Therefore, option 2 is correct. Option 1 is incorrect as Article 72 covers a broader range of offenses. Article 142 is not directly related to granting mercy petitions; its primary focus is the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, as correctly stated in option 4.  Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Contempt of Court Act, 1971, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Contempt                                 Description
1. Civil Contempt                               :   Publication of scandalous matter about a court
2. Criminal Contempt                             :   Wilful disobedience of a court order
3. Civil Contempt                               :   Interference with the administration of justice
4. Criminal Contempt                             :   Wilful breach of an undertaking given to a court

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders or breach of undertakings given to the court.  Therefore, option 2 is incorrect, and option 4 is correct. Criminal contempt involves publishing matter that scandalizes or lowers the authority of any court or interferes with the administration of justice.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect, and option 3 is correct.  Hence, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Characteristic
1.  Statutory Backing                             :   Panchayat Raj Act, 1996
2.  Seat of Gram Nyayalayas                    :   Village level
3.  Status                                        :   Court of Judicial Magistrate of First Class
4.  Jurisdiction                                  :   Civil cases only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.  While they aim to settle disputes at the village level, they are located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters, not necessarily in every village. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect. They are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, making option 3 correct.  Their jurisdiction includes both civil and criminal cases, thus making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, only option 3 is correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Detail
1.  Exemptions from Disclosure                 :   Cabinet papers only
2.  Time Frame for Providing Information       :   Within 15 days of request
3.  Appeals                                      :   To the Central Information Commission only
4.  Amendments                                   :   Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act exempts various types of information, including intelligence and security information, cabinet papers, and personal information, making option 1 incorrect. The time frame for providing information is generally within 30 days, and for matters concerning life or liberty, within 48 hours, making option 2 incorrect. Appeals can be made to both the Central Information Commission and State Information Commissions, making option 3 incorrect. The DPDP Act, 2023, did amend Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act to exempt personal information, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                        Detail
1.  EVM Manufacturer                            :   Only Public Sector Undertakings
2.  VVPAT Introduction                          :   2014 General Elections
3.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC) Genesis        :   1970
4.  Supreme Court Ruling on EVM-VVPAT Verification:   Full cross-verification mandated

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

EVMs are manufactured by both Bharat Electronics Limited and Electronics Corporation of India Limited, not solely by public sector undertakings.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. VVPATs were fully deployed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, not 2014, making option 2 incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960, not 1970, making option 3 incorrect. The Supreme Court dismissed requests for full cross-verification of EVM data with VVPAT records, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                         Detail
1.  Financial Assistance Basis                   :   Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (currently)
2.  Constitutional Provision                      :   Explicitly mentioned in the Constitution
3.  Post-14th Finance Commission Status         :   Continue to receive special funding
4.  Examples of SCS States (historically)         :   Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Post-14th Finance Commission, SCS ceased to exist.  The current funding pattern to Northeastern and Himalayan states is not based on SCS status. Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. Historically, Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted SCS status, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only option 4 is correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                       Detail
1.  Administrative Control                       :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2.  First Cantonment Established                  :   1765
3.  Legal Framework                             :   Cantonments Act, 2006
4.  Number of Cantonments in India (currently) :   51

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Cantonments are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, making option 1 incorrect. Barrackpore (Calcutta) was the first cantonment, established in 1765, making option 2 correct.  Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, making option 3 correct. There are currently 61 cantonments in India, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                  Key Feature
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                           :   Metadata retention limited to six months
2. Citizenship Act, 1955                        :   Acquisition of citizenship through naturalization
3. Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024        :   Reduced naturalization period for specified migrants
4. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                :   Defines civil and criminal contempt
5. Telecommunications Act, 2023               :   Spectrum allocation through auction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, notably limits the storage of Aadhaar metadata to a maximum of six months, a crucial aspect of privacy protection affirmed by the Supreme Court. The Citizenship Act, 1955, outlines the various ways an individual can acquire Indian citizenship, including naturalization, a process involving fulfilling specific residency and other requirements. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, implemented the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, significantly reducing the naturalization period for certain categories of migrants. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a legal framework defining and addressing civil and criminal contempt of court.  Finally, the Telecommunications Act, 2023, introduces a significant shift in spectrum allocation, primarily through auctions, aiming for greater transparency and efficiency.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all five correctly matched pairs is the accurate response.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution and related laws, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Act                                   Key Aspect
1. Article 72                                     :   President's power to grant pardons
2. Article 137                                    :   Supreme Court's power of review
3. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                     :   Establishment of village courts
4. Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964            :   Establishment of Foreigners Tribunals
5. Section 6A of Citizenship Act, 1955          :   Special provision related to Assam Accord


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, established a system of village courts to facilitate the speedy resolution of minor disputes.  The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, established the legal framework for Foreigners Tribunals, which play a critical role in determining the citizenship status of individuals. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, is a special provision directly linked to the Assam Accord, addressing citizenship issues stemming from the accord.  Therefore, option (c), including all five pairs, is the correct answer.


**3. With reference to governance and administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Act/Body                                  Characteristic Feature
1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)           :   Joint funding by the Centre and States
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                             :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
3. Model Code of Conduct (MCC)                    :   Guidelines for free and fair elections
4. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Setting global standards for auditing local governance
5.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)           :  Swift disposal of rape and POCSO cases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are characterized by joint funding and implementation between the central and state governments. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on participatory planning at the panchayat level, leading to the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs). The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is a crucial framework ensuring free and fair elections by regulating the conduct of political parties and candidates. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are designed to expedite the processing of rape and POCSO Act cases.  Therefore, option (c), indicating that all pairs are correctly matched, is the correct answer.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

     Institution/Body                                  Primary Function/Responsibility
1.  NITI Aayog                                     :   Revamping of Centrally Sponsored Schemes
2.  Election Commission of India (ECI)            :   Enforcement of Model Code of Conduct
3.  Supreme Court of India                         :   Final arbiter on constitutional matters
4.  Parliamentary Committees (PCs)                 :   Scrutiny of government expenditure and policies
5.  District Level Committee (under CAA,2019)    :   Processing of Citizenship Applications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. NITI Aayog plays a key role in the reform and restructuring of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct during elections. The Supreme Court of India serves as the final arbiter on matters related to the constitution. Parliamentary Committees engage in the critical scrutiny of government expenditure and policies.  The District Level Committee, established under the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, plays a crucial role in processing citizenship applications. Therefore, option (c), which includes all five correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer.




**1. With reference to the Indian Judicial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Court Order                                  Legal Provision/Concept
1. Mercy Petition Rejection                     : Article 142
2. Curative Petition                             : Article 72
3. Contempt of Court Punishment                : Articles 129 and 215
4. Gram Nyayalaya Jurisdiction                  : Indian Evidence Act, 1872

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences, including death sentences, is enshrined in **Article 72** of the Indian Constitution.  Therefore, the rejection of a mercy petition falls under this article.  A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court has dismissed their review petition.  This remedy is rooted in the Supreme Court's inherent power under **Article 142** to do complete justice. The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from **Articles 129 and 215**, respectively.  Gram Nyayalayas, while not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, operate under principles of natural justice.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct pairing. Option (a) is incorrect because Article 142 relates to the curative petition, not the mercy petition. Option (b) is incorrect as Article 72 deals with mercy petitions, not contempt of court. Option (c) is incorrect because both pairs 2 and 4 are incorrectly matched; Article 72 is concerned with the President’s power of pardon and Gram Nyayalayas are not directly governed by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.


**2. With reference to the Indian Election System, consider the following pairs:**

   Election-Related Entity/Process                 Characteristic/Feature
1. EVM                                             : Manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited only
2. VVPAT                                          : First fully deployed in the 2017 Goa Assembly Elections
3. Model Code of Conduct                         : First introduced in 1960 during Kerala Assembly Elections
4. Association for Democratic Reforms vs ECI       : Ruled in favor of full cross-verification of EVM data with VVPAT records.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

EVMs are manufactured by both Bharat Electronics Limited and Electronics Corporation of India Limited.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. VVPATs were first fully deployed in the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections, not the 2017 Goa Assembly Elections, making statement 2 incorrect. The Model Code of Conduct was indeed first introduced in 1960 during Kerala Assembly Elections; thus, statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court, in Association for Democratic Reforms vs ECI, dismissed requests for full cross-verification of EVM data with VVPAT records, rendering statement 4 incorrect. Consequently, only statement 3 is correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**3. With reference to Governance Mechanisms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Governance Entity/Mechanism                  Key Feature/Role
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes     :  Deals with matters related to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution
2. NITI Aayog                                  :  Initiated a process for revamping Centrally Sponsored Schemes
3.  Right to Information Act, 2005              :  Exempts all personal information from disclosure under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
4.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)            : Established under the POCSO Act

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes deals with issues related to the welfare and rights of Scheduled Castes, not the Sixth Schedule, which concerns the administration of tribal areas in certain states.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The NITI Aayog did indeed initiate a process for revamping Centrally Sponsored Schemes, making statement 2 correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, did amend the RTI Act to exempt certain personal information from disclosure, thus statement 3 is correct. FTSCs are indeed used to handle cases under the POCSO Act, but their establishment is not solely limited to this act.  Therefore, statement 4 is partially correct but not fully accurate in the given context.  Hence, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

   Panchayati Raj Initiative/Concept              Characteristic/Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                            : Launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018
2. Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)          : Prepared exclusively at the Gram Panchayat level
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies
4.  Gram Nyayalayas                              :  Exempt from the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan was indeed launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018, making statement 1 correct. While PDPs are primarily prepared at the Gram Panchayat level, they also involve participation from Block and District levels, making statement 2 partially incorrect.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, making statement 3 correct. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed exempt from the strict rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, options 1, 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Financial Institutions and Policies, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Entity/Policy                        Characteristic/Feature
1. Cooperative Banks                             : Operate solely on the principle of "one person, one vote"
2. Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs)    : Income from InvITs is always tax-free for investors
3.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)          : Funding is exclusively provided by the central government.
4.  Special Financial Packages for States        : Granted based on a pre-defined, objective formula

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cooperative banks may use "one person, one vote" but other decision-making models may also exist, making statement 1 incorrect.  Income from InvITs is not always tax-free; it depends on various factors and regulations, making statement 2 incorrect. CSSs involve joint funding from the centre and states, making statement 3 incorrect. Special financial packages are discretionary and not granted based on a fixed formula, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 270                        :   Taxes levied and collected by the Union, wholly assigned to States
2. Article 275                        :   Grants-in-aid provided by the Union to States
3. Article 280                        :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 292                        :   Union government's power to borrow money within or outside India
5. Article 293                        :   State government's power to borrow money only within India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States. Article 275 outlines the Union's power to provide grants-in-aid to states. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of financial resources. Article 292 grants the Union government the power to borrow both domestically and internationally, while Article 293 restricts state governments to borrowing only within India.  These articles are fundamental to understanding India's fiscal federalism and the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the constitutional provisions related to fiscal federalism.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Finance Commission Recommendation    Feature
1. 15th Finance Commission             :   Vertical Devolution of 41% to States
2. 14th Finance Commission             :   Abolition of Special Category Status
3. 5th Finance Commission              :   Introduction of Special Category Status
4. Gadgil-Mukherjee Formula           :   Used for grants to Special Category States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a vertical devolution of 41% of the divisible pool to the states.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the abolition of the Special Category Status (SCS) for states. The 5th Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the basis for providing grants to states with SCS. These points are crucial for understanding the evolution of fiscal federalism in India and the changing mechanisms for resource allocation between the Union and States. Any option that omits one or more of these correctly matched pairs shows an incomplete grasp of the subject matter.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Area              State
1.  Whole of Arunachal Pradesh   :   Arunachal Pradesh
2. Parts of Himachal Pradesh     :   Himachal Pradesh
3. Parts of Jammu & Kashmir      :   Jammu & Kashmir
4. Parts of Rajasthan            :   Rajasthan
5. Parts of Uttarakhand          :   Uttarakhand

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a scheduled area.  Parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are also designated as scheduled areas under the Sixth Schedule.  Therefore, each pair accurately reflects the relationship between the scheduled area and the respective state.  Options (a), (c), and (d) demonstrate a partial or incomplete understanding of the geographical extent of scheduled areas under the Sixth Schedule.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Borrowing              Entity Allowed To Borrow
1. Borrowing within India         :   Union Government
2. Borrowing within India         :   State Government
3. Borrowing outside India        :   Union Government
4. Borrowing outside India        :   State Government
5. Borrowing without Union Consent:   State Government already indebted to Union


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Union Government can borrow both within and outside India (Articles 292). State Governments are allowed to borrow only within India (Article 293).  A state already indebted to the Union needs its consent for further borrowing (Article 293).  Pair 4 is incorrect as state governments cannot borrow outside India.  Therefore, only options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include one or more of the mismatched pairs, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the constitutional restrictions on borrowing powers of the Union and State governments.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Tax Type                           Levied and Collected By
1. Corporation Tax                     :   Union Government
2. Personal Income Tax                 :   Union Government
3. Central Goods and Services Tax (CGST):   Union Government
4. State Goods and Services Tax (SGST):   State Government
5. Integrated Goods and Services Tax (IGST):  Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Corporation tax, personal income tax, and CGST are levied and collected by the Union Government. SGST is levied and collected by the State Governments.  IGST, applicable on inter-state trade, is levied and collected by the Union Government. These are key components of India's tax structure and understanding their allocation is crucial for comprehending the fiscal relationship between the Union and the States.  Any option that omits one or more of the correctly matched pairs indicates an incomplete understanding of the Indian tax system.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                  Subject Matter
1. Article 270                               :  Taxes levied and collected by the Union, wholly assigned to States
2. Article 292                               :  Borrowing powers of State Governments outside India
3. Article 275                               :  Grants-in-aid provided by the Union to States
4. Article 280                               :  Establishment of a body to adjudicate disputes between the Union and States regarding the distribution of financial resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  While the Union levies and collects these taxes, a portion is allocated to the States.  Option 1 is thus correct. Article 292 empowers the Union government to borrow money both within and outside India, while State governments are only permitted to borrow within India. This makes option 2 incorrect.  Article 275 mandates that the Union shall provide grants-in-aid to States to ensure that they can meet their financial responsibilities and provide essential services.  Option 3 is therefore correct.  Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, a constitutional body responsible for recommending the principles governing the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes and the grants-in-aid to the States. This makes option 4 correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Parameter                      Value (as of March 2023 or as stated)
1.  States’ revenue expenditure met from their own revenue sources     : 73%
2.  Share of states from divisible pool (based on 15th FC recommendations) : 51%
3. Debt-GDP ratio of states                     : 27.5%
4. Weight assigned to Income Distance by 15th FC in horizontal devolution : 55%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that states only meet 58% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources. This makes option 1 incorrect. The share of states from the divisible pool, according to the 15th Finance Commission, is 41%, not 51%. Option 2 is therefore incorrect. The debt-GDP ratio of states as of March 2023 is correctly stated as 27.5% in the text, making option 3 correct. The 15th Finance Commission assigned a weight of 45%, not 55%, to Income Distance in horizontal devolution. This makes option 4 incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                  Special Status/Demand
1. Bihar                     : Granted Special Category Status in 1969
2. Andhra Pradesh          : Demanded Special Category Status
3. Jammu & Kashmir        : Granted Special Category Status in 1969


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bihar was not granted Special Category Status (SCS) in 1969.  The states granted SCS in 1969 were Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect.  Andhra Pradesh did indeed demand Special Category Status, making option 2 correct. Jammu & Kashmir was correctly identified as receiving SCS in 1969, making option 3 correct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                    Provision Related To
1. Article 244(2)                            :  Fifth Schedule provisions
2. Article 3                                   : Formation of new states
3. Article 282                               :  Discretionary grants
4. Article 371                               :  Special provisions for certain states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 244(2) relates to the Sixth Schedule, not the Fifth Schedule, which deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas. Option 1 is incorrect. Article 3 deals with the formation of new states and alteration of boundaries, making option 2 correct. Article 282 allows the Union and State governments to make grants for any public purpose, which is the basis for discretionary grants. This makes option 3 correct.  Article 371 contains special provisions for certain states, making option 4 correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                          Key Feature/Objective
1. Mission Karmayogi                        : Focuses solely on contractual employees
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                       : Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
3. Common Service Centres (CSCs)            : Primarily serves urban populations
4.  National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)       : Excludes CSCs as a pillar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, including contractual employees, but is not solely focused on them. Option 1 is therefore incorrect. Jan Yojana Abhiyan is indeed aimed at preparing Panchayat Development Plans.  Option 2 is correct.  CSCs are primarily designed to serve rural populations.  Option 3 is incorrect. CSCs are one of the three pillars of the NeGP.  Option 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.



**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Cantonment Feature                                  Fact
1. First Cantonment established                 :   Barrackpore in 1765
2. Number of Cantonments post-independence establishment :   6
3. Governing Act                                   :   Cantonments Act, 2006
4. Administrative Control                       :   Ministry of Home Affairs
5. Ex-officio President of Cantonment Board    :   Local MLA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The first cantonment, Barrackpore, was indeed established in 1765 by the East India Company.  Six new cantonments were established in India after independence, adding to the existing number. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments.  However, the administrative control of cantonments rests with the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The Station Commander of the cantonment serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board, not a locally elected MLA. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of administrative control and the President of the Cantonment Board. Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate matching of pairs 1, 2, and 3.


**2. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

    NHRC Feature                                        Fact
1. Establishment Act                               :   Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Appointment of Chairperson and Members        :   Parliamentary Committee
3. Tenure of Chairperson and Members               :   Five years, or until age 70, whichever is earlier
4. Removal from Office                            :   By the President after consultation with the Lok Sabha
5. Powers of NHRC                                :   Powers equivalent to a High Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC was indeed established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (as amended).  The Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister, not a parliamentary committee. The tenure is three years or until age 70, not five years. Removal is by Presidential order after consultation with the Supreme Court, not the Lok Sabha. The NHRC possesses powers similar to a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, not equivalent to a High Court.  Only pair 1 is correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Act Feature                                    Fact
1.  Regulatory Body                             :   Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)
2.  Appeal Mechanism                            :   Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT)
3.  Penalty for violation of Data Principal's duties:   Up to ₹50,000
4.  Data Fiduciary Obligation                    :  Appoint a data protection officer
5.  Exemption from Data Principal's rights        :  Notified agencies in the interest of national security


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is the regulatory body as per the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).  The penalty for violation of a data principal's duties is up to ₹10,000, not ₹50,000. Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) are required to appoint a data protection officer.  Exemptions from data principal rights apply to notified agencies for national security reasons.  Thus, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to Presidential Powers in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Presidential Power                                   Legal Basis
1.  Granting Pardons                               :   Article 72
2.  Proclaiming Emergency                           :   Article 352
3.  Appointing the Chief Justice of India           :   Article 124
4.  Addressing Joint Sessions of Parliament         :   Article 87
5.  Dissolving the Lok Sabha                         :   Article 85


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. Article 352 deals with the power of the President to proclaim an Emergency. Article 124 outlines the appointment of the Chief Justice of India by the President.  Article 87 allows the President to address joint sittings of Parliament. Finally, Article 85 grants the President the power to dissolve the Lok Sabha.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option.  Other options incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following pairs:**

    Finance Commission Feature                        Fact
1.  Constitutional Provision                         :   Article 280
2.  Vertical Devolution Basis                       :   Recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission
3.  Horizontal Devolution Criteria                  :   Population (2011 Census) is a criterion
4.  Grants-in-Aid                                 :   Provided under Article 275
5.  State Borrowing from abroad                    :   Allowed without Union Government consent


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission's establishment is mandated by Article 280 of the Constitution.  Population (2011 Census) is one of several criteria used for horizontal devolution.  Grants-in-aid are indeed provided under Article 275. However, the vertical devolution basis is not solely based on the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations; it evolves with each commission's report. States are not permitted to borrow from abroad without the Union Government's consent. Hence, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct option.  The other options include incorrectly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    SCS Feature                                      Fact
1.  First introduction of SCS                       :   1969
2.  Basis for granting SCS                         :   Geographical and socio-economic disadvantages
3.  Constitutional Provision for SCS                 :   Article 370
4.  Funding mechanism for SCS states               :   Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (currently)
5.  Current Status of SCS                          :   No longer granted to any state


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Special Category Status (SCS) was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission. The basis for granting SCS was indeed geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  There is no specific constitutional provision dedicated solely to SCS; however,  various provisions under Articles 371 and related articles provide special provisions to certain states. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for funding SCS states, but this is no longer applicable as the concept of SCS, as officially designated, no longer exists, and  no state currently holds the official designation of SCS. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer.  The other options contain incorrectly matched pairs.


**7. With reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, consider the following pairs:**

    CrPC Feature                                      Fact
1.  Forensic Investigation                           :   Mandatory for offences punishable with at least 3 years of imprisonment
2.  Specimen Collection                             :   Magistrate can order any person to provide specimen signatures
3.  Joint Trials                                   :   Allowed only when all accused are present
4.  Timelines for Procedures                       :   Specified for submission of medical reports
5.  Replacing Act                                  :   Indian Evidence Act, 1872


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CrPC, 1973, mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with at least seven years, not three years, of imprisonment.  Magistrates can order specimen collection (signatures, handwriting, etc.).  Joint trials can proceed even if some accused are absent.  Timelines are indeed specified for various procedures, including medical report submission.  The CrPC, 1973, did not replace the Indian Evidence Act, 1872;  the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, replaced the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer. Other options include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**8. With reference to Articles 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                          Interpretation by Supreme Court
1.  Article 14                                      :   Right to Equality includes right to be free from adverse effects of climate change.
2.  Article 21                                      :   Right to Life includes right to a healthy environment
3.  Article 14                                      :   Guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws
4.  Article 21                                      :   Right to Life encompasses right to livelihood
5.  Article 21                                      :   Right to Life includes the right to privacy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has interpreted Article 14 to include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. Article 21's right to life has been expanded to include the right to a healthy environment and the right to livelihood.  Article 21 also encompasses the right to privacy. Article 14 does guarantee equality before the law and equal protection of the laws. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer. Other options incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The core issue here is the understanding of the expansive interpretation of fundamental rights by the Supreme Court.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body                      Key Function/Characteristic
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :  Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)  :  Oversees the recruitment of civil servants
3. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)     :  Deals with corruption complaints within the government
4. Law Commission of India                :  Advises the government on legal reforms
5. NITI Aayog                              :  Formulates national development plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, tasked with investigating human rights violations. The UPSC is responsible for recruiting civil servants to the Indian Administrative Service, Indian Police Service, and other central services. The CVC is an independent body that investigates corruption complaints within the government. The Law Commission of India provides advice on legal reforms and the modernization of laws. NITI Aayog, a policy think tank, plays a pivotal role in formulating national development plans and strategies.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings; each accurately reflects the key function or characteristic of the respective constitutional or statutory body.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Legislation                                       Principal Area of Focus
1. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005             :   Regulates the functioning of the postal service
2. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA)     :   Governs the receipt of foreign funds by NGOs
3. Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024 : Deals with data protection and privacy
4. Post Office Act 2023                               :  Aims to prevent cheating in public examinations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The FCRA regulates the acceptance of foreign funds by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in India, ensuring transparency and accountability. The Post Office Act 2023 governs the functioning of the Indian postal service.  Pair 1 is incorrect because the RTI Act focuses on citizen's right to information, not postal service regulation. Pair 3 is incorrect because the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, aim to prevent cheating in public examinations, not data protection.  The distractors are carefully selected to represent areas related to governance but are ultimately mismatched with the respective acts/legislation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governing Body/Commission                Jurisdiction/Responsibility
1. State Finance Commission                 :   Oversees the allocation of funds between the central and state governments
2. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Deals with matters related to the welfare of scheduled castes
3. Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) :  Handles disputes related to the digital personal data protection
4. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)    :   Resolves disputes related to telecommunications services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. State Finance Commissions are responsible for recommending the distribution of financial resources between the state government and local bodies. The NCSC addresses issues related to the welfare and protection of rights of Scheduled Castes. The DPBI is responsible for overseeing data protection and privacy in India, handling complaints and enforcing regulations.  Pair 3 is incorrect. TDSAT handles disputes related to the telecommunications sector, not digital personal data protection. This question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between closely related but distinct governing bodies. The distractor, TDSAT, is cleverly chosen to test the candidate's in-depth understanding of the regulatory framework.


**4. With reference to special provisions for states in the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Provision                       Characteristic/Example
1. Special Category States (SCS)          :   Grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (historical)
2. Sixth Schedule                          :   Applies to specific tribal areas in Northeastern states
3. Article 282 (Discretionary Grants)      :   Provides for special financial packages to states
4. Article 371 (and subsequent Articles)  :   Grants special provisions to certain states based on socio-economic needs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Special Category States (SCS) historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, although this is no longer the case. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain Northeastern states. Article 282 allows the central government to provide discretionary grants to states for various purposes, including special financial packages.  Articles 371 and subsequent articles grant special provisions to certain states to address unique regional circumstances.  This question tests knowledge of constitutional provisions related to state-specific arrangements and the ability to recall historical information.  The inclusion of historical details like the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula makes the question more challenging.


**5. With reference to the Indian judicial system, consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Remedy/Petition                    Description
1. Mercy Petition                             :   Filed with the Supreme Court to address errors in a lower court's judgment
2. Curative Petition                          :   Filed with the President seeking clemency for a death sentence
3. Review Petition                            :   Filed after a curative petition is rejected by the Supreme Court
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)       :   Dedicated courts to expedite the handling of specific types of cases (rape, POCSO)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. A curative petition is the final legal recourse available to a convict seeking to overturn a Supreme Court decision.  FTSCs are specialized courts designed to expedite the resolution of rape and POCSO cases.  Pair 1 is incorrect; mercy petitions are filed with the President, not the Supreme Court. Pair 3 is incorrect; a review petition is filed with the Supreme Court to review its own judgment, not after a curative petition is rejected. The question tests the understanding of different legal remedies and their appropriate applications within the Indian judicial system.  The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, demanding a strong grasp of legal procedures.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Cantonment Feature                                   Fact
1. First Cantonment established                  :   Barrackpore in 1775
2. Number of Cantonments post-independence establishment :   6
3. Governing Act                                    :   Cantonments Act, 2006
4. Administrative Control                         :   Ministry of Home Affairs
5. Cantonment Station Commander's Role          :   Vice-President of the Cantonment Board


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** The text clearly states that 6 cantonments were established after independence.  This is a factual statement.
* **Pair 3:** The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments in India. This is accurate.
* **Pair 5:** The Cantonment Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board, making this a correct pairing.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** While Barrackpore was indeed an early cantonment, the year mentioned is incorrect. The text states it was established in 1765.
* **Pair 4:** Cantonment Boards fall under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This is a crucial distinction reflecting the military nature of cantonments.


**2. With reference to Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article            Specific Application in Recent Judgement
1. Article 14                       :   Right to clean air
2. Article 21                       :   Right to a healthy environment
3. Article 19                       :   Right to protest against environmental degradation
4. Writ Petition Name                 :   'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' related to the protection of Asiatic Lion.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:**  Article 21, guaranteeing the right to life, has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to encompass the right to a healthy environment. The recent judgment explicitly mentions Articles 14 and 21 in relation to the adverse effects of climate change.
* **Pair 4:** The mentioned writ petition is correctly linked to the landmark judgement.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** While Article 14 deals with equality before the law,  the specific application of the right to clean air is not directly stated in the given context.  The case primarily focuses on the broader right to a healthy environment.
* **Pair 3:** Article 19 relates to freedom of speech and expression, which might indirectly relate to environmental protests, but the direct linkage in the specific judgement is not explicitly mentioned in the text. The judgement primarily focuses on the right to life and equality, not directly on the right to protest, though it could be argued indirectly.  The question demands a precise and direct match.
* The case in the text was related to Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, not the Asiatic Lion.


**3. With reference to the Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision          Specific Function
1. Article 246                       :   Defines tax bases between Union and States
2. Article 270                       :   Distribution of taxes levied and collected by states
3. Article 275                       :   Grants-in-aid to states
4. Article 292                       :   Union government borrowing powers only within India
5. Article 280                       :   Establishes the GST Council


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** Article 246 correctly defines the division of tax powers between the Union and States.
* **Pair 3:** Article 275 accurately describes the constitutional provision for grants-in-aid.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 2:** Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, not the states.
* **Pair 4:** Article 292 allows the Union government to borrow both within and outside India.
* **Pair 5:** The GST Council is not a constitutional body established under Article 280.  Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission.


**4. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State Feature                                   Fact
1. First States granted SCS in 1969          :   Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland
2. Constitutional basis for SCS                 :   Article 370
3. Funding formula for SCS states prior to 14th FC:   Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
4. Recommendation body for ending SCS         :   15th Finance Commission
5. Current special funding pattern for Northeast: Based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** The text correctly identifies the first states to receive SCS in 1969.
* **Pair 3:** The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for funding SCS states before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.
* **Pair 5:** The text explicitly states that the current special funding pattern for the Northeast is based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 2:** There is no constitutional basis specifically designated as "Special Category Status." The text emphasizes that the Constitution does not explicitly provide for SCS.  While Article 370 was relevant to Jammu and Kashmir's special status, it is not the general constitutional basis for all SCS.
* **Pair 4:** The 14th Finance Commission, not the 15th, is the one that recommended the cessation of SCS.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                       Feature
1. Article 244(2)                               :   Empowers the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs
2. Number of ADCs currently in India              :   12
3. Power to make laws on land revenue           :   Exclusive power of the Union Government
4. Bardoloi Committee                             :   Recommended the inclusion of Nagaland in the Sixth Schedule
5. Applicable to tribal areas in Arunachal Pradesh:  True


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because:

* **Pair 1:** Article 244(2) correctly empowers the Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in the Sixth Schedule areas.
* **Pair 5:** The Sixth Schedule does apply to tribal areas in Arunachal Pradesh.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 2:** The text states there are currently 10 ADCs, not 12.
* **Pair 3:** The ADCs and ARCs, not the Union Government, have the power to make laws on land revenue within their jurisdiction.
* **Pair 4:** While the Bardoloi Committee was instrumental in the formation of the Sixth Schedule, the text does not explicitly state that it recommended the inclusion of Nagaland specifically.  The committee's recommendations led to the inclusion of several states in the Sixth Schedule.


**6. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

   Gram Nyayalaya Feature                    Fact
1.  Statutory backing                           :   Panchayat Raj Act, 1996
2.  Jurisdiction                               :   Both civil and criminal cases in specified areas
3.  Seat of Gram Nyayalaya                     :   At the headquarters of the block panchayat
4.  Appeal process                              :   Appeals are heard by the district court
5.  Exemption from rules of evidence             :   Partially exempt; bound by principles of natural justice


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because:

* **Pair 2:** Gram Nyayalayas do indeed have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases within their specified area.
* **Pair 3:** They are typically located at block panchayat headquarters.
* **Pair 5:**  While not entirely exempt, Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but they are bound by principles of natural justice.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because:

* **Pair 1:** The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, provides the statutory backing, not the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996.
* **Pair 4:** Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the relevant higher court, often the District Court, as specified in the text.  The specific time frame for disposal is not the focus here.



**7. With reference to the Contempt of Court, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Contempt                          Description
1. Civil Contempt                           :   Disobedience of a court order related to the payment of a fine
2. Criminal Contempt                         :   Publishing false information about court proceedings
3.  Article 129                               :   Grants power to High Courts to punish for contempt
4.  Contempt of Courts Act, 1971               :   Defines contempt of court
5.  Punishment for Contempt                   :  Imprisonment and fines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is the correct answer because all pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the information provided in the text on contempt of court.

* Pair 1: Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, which includes non-payment of fines.
* Pair 2: Criminal contempt includes actions that scandalize or interfere with court proceedings, including publishing false information.
* Pair 4: The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the primary legislation that defines and outlines the legal framework for contempt of court in India.
* Pair 5: The text mentions imprisonment and fines as potential punishments for contempt.


Option (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  Pair 3 is incorrect because Article 215, not Article 129, grants High Courts the power to punish for contempt. Article 129 gives this power to the Supreme Court.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 131                      :   Original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in disputes between the Centre and States
2. Article 244(2)                  :   Establishment of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
3. Article 280                     :   Appointment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 282                     :   Power of the Centre and States to make grants for any public purpose
5. Article 292                     :   Union Government's power to borrow money


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 131 explicitly grants the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and one or more States.  Article 244(2) forms the basis for the establishment of the Autonomous District Councils and Autonomous Regional Councils in specific states. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Article 282 empowers both the Union and State governments to make grants for any public purpose, even beyond their legislative competence. Finally, Article 292 details the borrowing powers of the Union government.  There are no inaccuracies or mismatches in any of the provided pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Act/Institution          Associated Function/Characteristic
1. Cantonment Boards            :   Administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act :   Deals with local self-government of cantonments
3. Ministry of Defence           :   Exercises administrative control over cantonments
4. Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 :   Governs the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
5.  Santhanam Committee         :   Recommended the establishment of the CBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Cantonment Boards manage civic functions in cantonment areas and operate under the Cantonments Act, 2006. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with urban local bodies, encompassing cantonments' local self-governance.  The Ministry of Defence maintains administrative control over cantonments. The CBI's functioning is governed by the DSPE Act, 1946.  Finally, the Santhanam Committee's recommendations led to the establishment of the CBI.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**3. With reference to Centre-State relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Concept       Constitutional Article
1.  Vertical Devolution             :   Article 270
2.  Horizontal Devolution           :   Article 275
3.  Grants-in-Aid                   :   Article 275
4.  Union Government's Borrowing Power : Article 292
5.  Finance Commission              :   Article 280


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid from the Centre to States. Article 292 outlines the Union government's borrowing powers. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission.  Vertical devolution, the share of divisible pool to states,  is not specifically tied to a single article but is a consequence of the Finance Commission's recommendations guided by Article 280 and the distribution mentioned in Article 270. Similarly, horizontal devolution, the distribution among states, is also determined by the Finance Commission's recommendations based on various criteria. Thus, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to mismatched pairs.


**4. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) and Special Packages, consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                       Correctness
1.  SCS is constitutionally mandated         :   Correct
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for SCS grants :   Correct
3.  The 14th Finance Commission abolished SCS :   Correct
4.  Special Packages are granted under Article 275 :  Incorrect
5.  Special Packages are purely discretionary   :   Correct

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS, it has been a practice based on various Finance Commission recommendations. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for distributing funds to SCS states.  The 14th Finance Commission effectively ended the SCS categorization.  Special Packages are discretionary grants, not mandated by any specific article.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. Special packages are granted under Article 282, not Article 275, which deals with grants-in-aid. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Area Provision/Concept             Characteristic
1.  Sixth Schedule Areas                         :   Covers Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
2.  Fifth Schedule Areas                         :   Administered by Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)
3.  Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963 :   Applies to Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim
4.  Protected Areas                             :   Include whole of Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand
5.  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)       :   Have power to make laws on subjects like forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, social customs etc.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. The Sixth Schedule specifically covers the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Fifth Schedule areas are administered by Tribes Advisory Councils. The 1963 Order on restricted areas applies to the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim.  Protected areas include the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh and parts of several other states.  ADCs under the Sixth Schedule have extensive legislative and executive powers over a range of matters.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                  Specific Detail
1. Statutory Backing                     :   The Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996
2. Seat of Gram Nyayalayas               :   Headquarters of the Block Panchayat
3. Appeals in Civil Cases                 :   To the High Court
4. Jurisdiction                           :  Primarily handles family disputes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Incorrect:** Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996. The latter act deals with the extension of Panchayati Raj institutions to Scheduled Areas.

2. **Incorrect:** While Gram Nyayalayas are ideally located at the headquarters of an intermediate Panchayat, the exact location can vary depending on practical considerations and administrative decisions.  The question implies a rigid, universally applicable location.

3. **Incorrect:** Appeals in civil cases from Gram Nyayalayas go to the District Court, not directly to the High Court.  This is a crucial distinction in the judicial hierarchy.

4. **Incorrect:**  Gram Nyayalayas handle both civil and criminal cases, encompassing a broader range of petty disputes than just family matters.  The limitation to family disputes is an oversimplification.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Contempt                     Description
1. Civil Contempt                       :   Publicly criticizing a judge's personal life
2. Criminal Contempt                    :   Wilful disobedience of a court order
3. Civil Contempt                       :   Publishing material that scandalizes a court
4. Criminal Contempt                    :   Refusal to comply with a court summons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Publicly criticizing a judge's personal life doesn't directly fall under the definition of civil contempt. Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of court orders or processes.  While it might indirectly affect the court's authority, it's not the primary definition.

2. **Correct:** Wilful disobedience of a court order is a clear-cut case of civil contempt. This directly undermines the court's authority and its ability to enforce its decisions.

3. **Incorrect:** Publishing material that scandalizes a court is a form of *criminal* contempt, not civil contempt.  Criminal contempt focuses on actions that undermine the court's authority or interfere with the administration of justice.

4. **Correct:** Refusal to comply with a court summons is a form of civil contempt.  It's a direct act of disobedience to a court order or process.


**3. With reference to the President's Power on Mercy Petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                    Application
1. Article 72                               :   Applies only to cases involving offences against state laws
2. Article 72                               :   Empowers the President to pardon individuals convicted by court-martial
3. Article 142                              :   Provides the basis for the President's power of pardon
4. Article 72                               :  Covers offences against laws under the executive power of the Union


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Incorrect:** Article 72's scope extends beyond offences against state laws. It encompasses offences against both Union and State laws, where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.

2. **Correct:**  Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in cases involving court-martial convictions.

3. **Incorrect:** Article 142 deals with the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, not the President's pardon power.  The President's power is derived from Article 72.

4. **Correct:** Article 72 covers offences against laws that fall under the executive power of the Union. This is a significant part of the President's power in granting pardons.


**4. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Grounds for Filing                     Specific Condition
1. Violation of principles of natural justice :  Requires demonstration of prejudice to the petitioner
2. Judge's undisclosed connection to the case:  Can be filed only after dismissal of a review petition
3. Apprehension of bias                  :   Needs evidence of actual bias demonstrated by the judge
4. Procedural irregularities in the lower court :  Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is the final remedy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The explanation follows:

1. **Incorrect:** While a violation of the principles of natural justice is a ground for filing a curative petition, merely demonstrating a violation is insufficient. The petitioner must also show that this violation caused them prejudice or affected the outcome of the case.

2. **Correct:** A judge's undisclosed connection to the case is a valid ground for a curative petition.  Crucially, curative petitions are a final remedy, only available after other avenues like review petitions have been exhausted.

3. **Incorrect:**  An apprehension of bias, while a valid ground, requires more than just suspicion. The petitioner must present evidence suggesting actual bias on the part of the judge that influenced the judgment.  Mere apprehension isn't enough.

4. **Correct:**  Curative petitions are indeed the final constitutional remedy available to a petitioner whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  This signifies the extraordinary nature of this legal recourse.


**5.  With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                   Specific Detail
1. Funding Source                          :   State budgets
2. Type of Court                           :   State-level courts
3. Cases Handled                          :   Cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act
4. Implementing Ministry                  :   Ministry of Home Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's break down why:

1. **Incorrect:** FTSCs are centrally sponsored schemes, and their expenditure is primarily borne by the Centre from the Nirbhaya Fund, not from state budgets. This highlights the central government's commitment to tackling these crimes swiftly.

2. **Incorrect:** While FTSCs function at the state level, they are not strictly state-level courts. They are special courts established under a centrally sponsored scheme, emphasizing the collaborative nature of justice delivery.

3. **Correct:** FTSCs are specifically designed to handle rape cases and those falling under the POCSO Act, highlighting the government's focus on protecting vulnerable populations.

4. **Incorrect:** The implementing ministry for FTSCs is the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This underscores the judicial, rather than purely executive, nature of the initiative.


**6. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                    Specific Detail
1. Administrative Control                  :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2. Establishment of First Cantonment       :   1765
3. Legal Framework                         :   Cantonments Act, 2006
4. Number of Cantonments in India (currently):   70


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Cantonment Boards are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This reflects the military nature of cantonments and their strategic importance.

2. **Correct:** The first cantonment in India, Barrackpore (Calcutta), was established in 1765 by the East India Company. This marks a significant point in the history of British military presence in India.

3. **Correct:** Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006. This Act provides the legal framework for their governance and administration.

4. **Incorrect:**  There are currently 61 cantonments in India, not 70. The number has remained relatively stable for several years.


**7. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                    Application in Recent SC Judgement
1. Article 14                               :   Guarantees the right to a healthy environment
2. Article 21                               :   Includes the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change
3. Article 19                               :   Protects the right to protest against environmental degradation
4. Article 48A                             :   Directs the state to protect and improve the environment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched in relation to the Supreme Court's recent judgment on environmental issues.  Let's analyze:

1. **Incorrect:** While Article 14 guarantees equality before the law, the recent SC judgment primarily focused on Articles 21 (right to life) and the interpretation of this right to include freedom from adverse effects of climate change, rather than explicitly establishing a separate "right to a healthy environment" under Article 14.

2. **Correct:**  The Supreme Court's judgment directly linked Article 21 (right to life) with the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change, expanding the interpretation of this fundamental right.

3. **Incorrect:** Article 19 deals with freedom of speech and expression, etc. While protests related to environmental issues are protected under this article, the SC judgment did not explicitly link Article 19 to the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.

4. **Correct:** Article 48A, a Directive Principle of State Policy, directs the state to protect and improve the environment.  The SC judgment indirectly aligns with this directive principle by broadening the interpretation of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.


**8. With reference to Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                  Specific Feature
1. Structured Ward Sabhas                  :   Focus on urban areas only
2. Preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans:   Based on Panchayat Development Index (PDI)
3. Thematic Approach                       :  Excludes participation from youth and elderly
4.  Publication of GPDP                     :   On the e-Gram Swaraj portal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Structured Ward Sabhas, Gram Sabhas, Block Sabhas, and District Sabhas are all components of Jan Yojana Abhiyan, encompassing both rural and urban areas. The statement incorrectly limits it to urban areas.

2. **Correct:** The preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) under Jan Yojana Abhiyan is explicitly based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI), using data-driven insights to guide planning.

3. **Incorrect:**  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan emphasizes inclusive participation, actively engaging youth and the elderly (over 75 years) in the planning process.  The statement contradicts this inclusive approach.

4. **Correct:**  Approved GPDPs are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, promoting transparency and accessibility of development plans.


**9. With reference to Auditing of Local Bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Specific Feature
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : First centre of its kind globally
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) : Audits only state governments
3. Local Fund Audit                        :  Focuses solely on financial aspects of local bodies
4.  iCAL                                    : Located in Mumbai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Correct:** The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is indeed the first such centre in India, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  This is a significant development in improving local governance accountability.

2. **Incorrect:** The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audits both the Union and State governments, as well as other entities as per its mandate. The statement incorrectly limits its scope to state governments alone.

3. **Incorrect:** Local Fund Audits encompass a broader range of aspects beyond just financial matters. They also cover administrative, operational, and compliance aspects of local bodies, providing a more holistic assessment.

4. **Incorrect:**  iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai. This detail is crucial for accurate identification of the institution's location.


**10. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Framework                                 Specific Feature
1. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996      :   Exclusively deals with international commercial disputes
2. UNCITRAL Model Law                         :   Forms the basis of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
3. New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019:  Facilitates institutional arbitration
4. Indian Council of Arbitration                :   A government department


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, applies to all kinds of arbitrations, including domestic commercial disputes, not just international ones.  The statement incorrectly restricts its scope.

2. **Correct:** The UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration serves as the foundation for the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, demonstrating India's adoption of international best practices in dispute resolution.

3. **Correct:** The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, is specifically designed to facilitate institutional arbitration, providing a structured framework for resolving disputes through designated institutions.

4. **Incorrect:** The Indian Council of Arbitration is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, not a government department.  This indicates its independent, non-governmental nature.


**11. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

   Component                                    Specific Feature
1. Guiding Principles                          :   Emphasis on traditional hierarchical training methods
2. 70-20-10 Mandate                           :   Allocates 70% of learning to classroom training
3. Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) Karmayogi Platform :  A centralized online learning portal
4.  Performance Evaluation                     : Based solely on individual learner performance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles explicitly advocate a shift *away* from traditional, rule-based training towards a role-based and competency-driven approach. The statement contradicts this core principle.

2. **Incorrect:** The 70-20-10 mandate allocates 70% of learning to on-the-job experiences and reflections, 20% to learning through interactions with others, and only 10% to formal, planned training. The statement misrepresents the allocation of learning resources.

3. **Correct:** The Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT) Karmayogi Platform is indeed a comprehensive online portal designed to support the capacity-building goals of Mission Karmayogi.  It serves as a central hub for various learning resources and programs.

4. **Incorrect:**  Performance evaluation on the iGOT-Karmayogi platform is multi-faceted, encompassing not only individual learners but also supervisors, content providers, and creators.  The statement incorrectly limits the evaluation criteria.


**12. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                     Specific Detail
1. Nodal Officers                             :   Appointed only at the central government level
2. Timelines for redressal                     :   Increased to 45 days
3. Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI):   Ranks Ministries/Departments based on grievance redressal efficiency
4. Dedicated Grievance Cells                  :   Not mandatory in all Ministries/Departments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Incorrect:** Nodal Officers for Public Grievances are appointed across all Ministries/Departments, not just at the central government level. This ensures a decentralized approach to grievance handling.

2. **Incorrect:** Timelines for effective grievance redressal have been *reduced* to 21 days, demonstrating a commitment to quicker resolution of grievances. The statement incorrectly states an increase in timelines.

3. **Correct:** The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is designed to rank Ministries/Departments based on their performance in grievance redressal.  This promotes accountability and encourages improvement in grievance handling processes.

4. **Incorrect:** Dedicated Grievance Cells are mandated to be set up in every Ministry/Department, ensuring adequate resources are allocated to address public grievances effectively. The statement incorrectly suggests they are not mandatory.


**13. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas, consider the following pairs:**

   Area                                     Specific Feature
1. Protected Areas                          :   Include parts of all states in India
2. Restricted Areas                         :   Encompass the entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands
3. Foreigner Entry to Protected Areas      :   Requires special permit for all foreigners
4.  Sikkim                                  :   Entire state is a Protected Area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Protected Areas are not located in all parts of all states in India.  Their distribution is concentrated in specific regions known for their ecological significance.

2. **Correct:** The entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands is indeed designated as a Restricted Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.

3. **Correct:** Foreigners, except citizens of Bhutan, require special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas. This highlights the stringent regulations governing access to these sensitive areas.

4. **Incorrect:** Sikkim is partly in a Protected Area and partly in a Restricted Area, not entirely a Protected Area.  This reflects the nuanced designation of areas based on their specific characteristics.



**14. With reference to Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Concept                          Specific Detail
1. Seventh Schedule                           :   Defines the distribution of taxes between Union and States
2. Vertical Devolution                         :   Refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes
3. Horizontal Devolution                       :   Based solely on population data
4. Finance Commission                          :   Recommends distribution of only direct taxes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **Correct:** The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of powers, including the allocation of tax bases, between the Union and State governments, forming the foundation of fiscal federalism in India.

2. **Correct:** Vertical devolution accurately describes the share allocated to states from the divisible pool of taxes collected by the central government. This represents the vertical flow of funds from the center to the states.

3. **Incorrect:** Horizontal devolution considers several factors beyond just population data, including income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts. The statement oversimplifies the criteria.

4. **Incorrect:** The Finance Commission's recommendations encompass the distribution of both direct and indirect taxes, playing a crucial role in determining the allocation of resources between the Union and State governments.


**15. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Specific Feature
1. Andhra Pradesh                            : Currently holds Special Category Status
2. Jammu & Kashmir                           : Was granted SCS in 1969
3.  SCS criteria                              :  Based solely on geographical factors
4.  Granting of SCS                           :  Automatic for all North Eastern states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Let's analyze:

1. **Incorrect:** Andhra Pradesh does *not* currently hold Special Category Status.  The granting of SCS is a complex process based on various factors, and Andhra Pradesh's request for SCS has been a subject of ongoing discussion.

2. **Correct:** Jammu & Kashmir was indeed granted Special Category Status in 1969, reflecting its unique geographical and socio-economic circumstances at the time.

3. **Incorrect:** The criteria for granting Special Category Status are multifaceted, encompassing geographical factors, socio-economic indicators, and other relevant considerations.  The statement oversimplifies the criteria.

4. **Incorrect:**  The granting of SCS is not automatic for all North Eastern states.  Each state's case is evaluated individually based on its specific circumstances and needs.


**16. With reference to the Tribunal System in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Tribunal/Concept                          Specific Feature
1. Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)     :   Appeals lie with the High Courts
2. Article 323A                              :   Provides for the establishment of CAT
3. Tribunals                                 :   Always have original jurisdiction only
4.  Jurisdiction of Tribunals                 :   Limited to specific subject matters


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Let's examine each:

1. **Incorrect:** Appeals from the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) primarily lie with the Supreme Court, not the High Courts, as clarified by the Supreme Court in 2010.  This highlights the hierarchical structure of the judicial system.

2. **Correct:** Article 323A of the Constitution explicitly provides for the establishment of Administrative Tribunals, including the CAT, to address disputes related to public services.

3. **Incorrect:** Tribunals can have both original and appellate jurisdiction, depending on the specific legislation establishing them.  The statement incorrectly restricts their jurisdiction to original cases only.

4. **Correct:** Each tribunal is given a specific jurisdiction to hear and decide cases within its designated area of expertise.  This ensures specialized knowledge and efficient handling of specific types of disputes.


**17. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                   Specific Detail
1. Appointment of Board Members            :   For a term of five years
2. Appeals against DPBI decisions          :   Lie with the Supreme Court
3. Data Principal's Rights                  :   Includes the right to seek correction of personal data
4.  Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDF)      :   Designation is automatic for all large corporations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** Board members are appointed for a term of two years, not five years, allowing for periodic review and potential changes in membership.

2. **Incorrect:** Appeals against DPBI decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not directly with the Supreme Court. This reflects the specialized nature of telecom-related disputes.

3. **Correct:** Data principals have the right to obtain information about the processing of their personal data, seek correction and erasure of their data, and have access to grievance redressal mechanisms. The right to seek correction is a key aspect of data protection.

4. **Incorrect:**  The designation of Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDF) is not automatic for all large corporations. It's based on factors such as volume and sensitivity of data, potential risks, and impact on national security and public order, making it a case-by-case determination.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

   Campaign Component                          Specific Detail
1. Structured Ward Sabha/Gram Sabha          :   Held for preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for FY 2025-26
2. Thematic developmental gaps identification :   Based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI)
3. Inclusive participation                     :   Exclusively targets youth below 18 years of age
4. Approved GPDP publication                 :   On the e-Gram Swaraj portal
5.  Implementation methodology               :   Focuses solely on Gram Panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People's Plan Campaign, aims to enhance people's participation in creating Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  Statement 1 is correct as structured Ward Sabhas and Gram Sabhas are integral to this process for the fiscal year 2025-26. Statement 2 is accurate because the identification of thematic developmental gaps relies on the data provided by the Panchayat Development Index (PDI). Statement 4 is also correct as the approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; while the Abhiyan encourages inclusive participation, it specifically mentions engaging youth and the elderly (over 75), not exclusively those under 18.  Statement 5 is incorrect because implementation involves all three tiers of Panchayats—Gram, Block, and District. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM), consider the following pairs:**

   GRM Aspect                                     Specific Feature
1. Nodal Officers for Public Grievances        :   Appointed only in State-level Ministries
2. Dedicated Grievance Cells                    :   Established in every Ministry/Department with unlimited resources
3. Timelines for grievance redressal             :   Reduced to 14 days from the existing 30 days
4. Grievance redressal assessment index (GRAI) :   Used for ranking Ministries/Departments on a monthly basis
5.  CPGRAMS online platform                   :   Exclusively for central government grievances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text highlights several aspects of the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM). Statement 1 is incorrect as Nodal Officers are appointed across all Ministries/Departments, not just at the State level.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while dedicated cells are established, the text doesn't specify unlimited resources. Statement 3 is incorrect; the timeline reduction is to 21 days, not 14. However, statement 4 is correct: the Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is used for monthly ranking of Ministries/Departments.  Statement 5 is incorrect; CPGRAMS connects with both central and state-level ministries. Therefore, only statement 4 is correctly matched.


**3.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

   Mission Karmayogi Aspect                    Specific Detail
1.  Training and Capacity Building Approach     :   Exclusively rule-based
2.  70-20-10 Mandate                          :   70% classroom learning, 20% online modules, 10% self-study
3.  iGOT-Karmayogi Platform                   :   Does not monitor the performance of users
4.  Target Civil Servants                      :   Excludes contractual employees
5.  Guiding Principle                         :   Maintaining departmental silos


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi focuses on creating a future-ready civil service. Statement 1 is incorrect; the mission shifts from rule-based to role-based training. Statement 2 is incorrect; the 70-20-10 mandate emphasizes on-the-job experience (70%), learning from others (20%), and planned training (10%), not the distribution mentioned in the option. Statement 3 is incorrect; the iGOT-Karmayogi platform actively monitors user performance. Statement 4 is incorrect; it explicitly includes all civil servants, including contractual employees. Statement 5 is incorrect; it aims to move beyond departmental silos. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following pairs:**

   CSS Aspect                                  Specific Detail
1. Funding Mechanism                          :   Union Government provides complete funding
2.  Defining Report                             :   The Baijal Committee Report of 1987
3.  Current Framework Basis                   :   Report by Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015)
4.  Funding Pattern for Core Schemes (NE States):   Centre: State ratio of 50:50
5.  Monitoring Body                            :   Solely the Ministry of Finance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) involve joint funding and implementation. Statement 1 is incorrect; CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Baijal Committee is not mentioned in the context of CSS definitions. Statement 3 is correct; the current framework is based on the 2015 report. Statement 4 is incorrect; the funding ratio for core schemes in Northeast states is 90:10 (Centre:State). Statement 5 is incorrect; NITI Aayog also plays a role in monitoring, along with the Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to the Auditing of Local Bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   Auditing Aspect                               Specific Detail
1. iCAL (International Centre for Audit of Local Governance):   Second such centre in India
2. AuditOnline application                       :   Developed by the Ministry of Rural Development
3. CAG's mandate for audit of Local Bodies      :   Derived from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971
4.  Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)     :   Operates independently of the CAG
5.  Implementation of AuditOnline              :   Awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage discusses the auditing mechanisms for local bodies. Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is the first such center in India. Statement 2 is correct; AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. Statement 3 is correct; the CAG's mandate originates from the 1971 Act. Statement 4 is incorrect; ELFAs work under the CAG's supervision. Statement 5 is correct; AuditOnline received the award. Therefore, only statements 3 and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Implementing Agency/Ministry
1. Project PARI (Public Art of India)     :    Ministry of External Affairs
2. Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana        :    Ministry of Road Transport and Highways
3. Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana:    Ministry of Women and Child Development
4.  Jiyo Parsi Scheme                   :    Ministry of Minority Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because only the Jiyo Parsi Scheme is correctly matched with its implementing ministry. The Jiyo Parsi Scheme, aimed at addressing the declining Parsi population, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Minority Affairs.

Option (a) is incorrect because Project PARI (Public Art of India) is implemented by the Ministry of Culture, not the Ministry of External Affairs.  The Ministry of External Affairs focuses on international relations.

Option (b) is incorrect because the Pradhan Mantri JI-VAN Yojana, focused on biofuels, is implemented by the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas, not the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.  The latter ministry's focus is on roads and transportation.

Option (c) is incorrect because while the Mukhyamantri Majhi Ladki Bahin Yojana is indeed a women-centric scheme, it is implemented by the Maharashtra state government, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development at the central level.  State governments have their own schemes and implementation mechanisms.  The central ministry sets broad guidelines and policies but doesn't directly implement state-level schemes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                           Key Feature
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                    :   Makes Aadhaar mandatory for all government services
2. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008           :   Establishes village courts in all states and union territories
3.  Contempt of Courts Act, 1971       :   Defines civil and criminal contempt of court
4.  SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 :  Allows anticipatory bail in all cases under the Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, accurately defines civil and criminal contempt of court.

Option (a) is incorrect because while the Aadhaar Act exists, it does *not* make Aadhaar mandatory for *all* government services. The Supreme Court ruling clarified its use for welfare schemes but not for all services.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, while establishing village courts, does not mandate their establishment in *every* state and union territory; certain exceptions exist.

Option (c) is incorrect for the reasons stated above regarding the Aadhaar Act and the Gram Nyayalayas Act.

Option (d) is incorrect because the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, *does not* allow anticipatory bail in all cases under the Act.  Section 18 specifically restricts the applicability of anticipatory bail under certain conditions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Yojana/Scheme                         Primary Objective
1.  National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) :  Promote tourism along the Ganga river
2.  Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban)   :  Construct 1 crore houses with focus on equity
3.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)     :  Exclusive funding by the Centre to states
4.  Ladki Bahin Yojana                     :  Provide financial assistance to women aged 21-65


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (Urban) aims to construct 1 crore houses with an emphasis on equitable distribution.  The Ladki Bahin Yojana aims to provide financial assistance to eligible women within a specified age group.

Option (a) is incorrect. The National Mission for Clean Ganga's primary objective is to clean the Ganga river, not to promote tourism, though tourism may be a secondary benefit of a clean river.

Option (c) is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) involve *shared* funding between the Centre and States, not exclusive funding by the Centre.

Option (d) is incorrect because while the statement about the Ladki Bahin Yojana is correct, the question asks for *all* correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                        Function/Characteristic
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :  Sets global standards for auditing central government bodies
2.  National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF)          : Ranks higher education institutions based on 18 parameters
3.  Election Commission of India (ECI)                      :  Sets Model Code of Conduct for panchayat elections only
4.  Cantonment Boards                                     :  Administer civic services in military areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The NIRF ranks higher education institutions using a multi-parameter system.  Cantonment Boards are responsible for civic administration in designated military areas.

Option (b) is incorrect. The iCAL sets standards for auditing *local* governance bodies, not central government bodies.  The ECI sets the Model Code of Conduct for *all* elections, not just panchayat elections.

Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes one correctly matched pair.

Option (d) is incorrect because of the inaccuracies concerning iCAL and the ECI's role in the Model Code of Conduct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision/Act                     Description/Application
1. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution:   Governs the President's power to pardon convicts in state-level cases only
2.  Curative Petition                       :   A final legal remedy after a review petition is rejected by the Supreme Court
3.  Mercy Petition                         :  Can only be filed in cases involving offenses against the state
4.  Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:  Provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is the correct answer.  A curative petition is the last legal recourse after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.  A mercy petition is a plea for pardon or commutation of sentence. The Sixth Schedule addresses the administration of tribal areas.

Option (a) is incorrect because Article 72 extends to pardons for offenses against Union laws, not solely state-level cases.  The description of a mercy petition is also oversimplified.

Option (b) is incorrect. While the descriptions of a curative petition and the Sixth Schedule are correct, the question asks for *all* correctly matched pairs.

Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Ministry/Department
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                    Ministry of Rural Development
2. Mission Karmayogi                   Capacity Building Commission
3. National Quantum Mission             Department of Science & Technology
4. PM-WANI Scheme                     Department of Telecommunications

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People’s Plan Campaign, is an initiative of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi is indeed driven by the Capacity Building Commission, making pair 2 correct. The National Quantum Mission falls under the Department of Science & Technology, making pair 3 correct.  Finally, the PM-WANI (Prime Minister's WiFi Access Network Interface) scheme is a project of the Department of Telecommunications, making pair 4 correct. Hence, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                          Key Provision
1. Prohibition of Child Marriage (Himachal Pradesh Amendment) Bill, 2024 : Raised the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 years
2. Telecommunication Tariff (70th Amendment) Order, 2024 : Regulatory framework for PM-WANI scheme
3. The Uttar Pradesh Digital Media Policy 2024 : Offers up to Rs 8 lakh per month to influencers promoting government initiatives

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Himachal Pradesh Amendment Bill raised the minimum marriage age for girls to 21, not 18 years, making pair 1 incorrect. The Telecommunication Tariff (70th Amendment) Order, 2024, does indeed focus on the regulatory framework for the PM-WANI scheme, making pair 2 correct. The Uttar Pradesh Digital Media Policy 2024 correctly describes the financial incentives for influencers, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                      Key Feature/Benefit
1. Subhadra Scheme                       Provides ₹50,000 over five years to one crore poor men aged between 21 and 60
2. Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF)  Provides grants by the central government for post-harvest management infrastructure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Subhadra scheme targets poor women, not men, and the age range is also specified incorrectly, making pair 1 incorrect. The Agricultural Infrastructure Fund (AIF) provides interest subvention on loans, not direct grants from the central government, making pair 2 incorrect. The RESET Programme is designed for retired sportspersons who have participated in both national and international events, not exclusively those with international medals, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Institution              Characteristic/Function
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing central government bodies
2. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) :  Appeals against its decisions lie with the Supreme Court
3.  Common Service Centre (CSC) e-Governance India Limited : Involved in implementing Project NAMAN

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, not central government bodies, making pair 1 incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court, making pair 2 incorrect. The CSC e-Governance India Limited is indeed a key partner in the implementation of Project NAMAN, making pair 3 correct. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                     Participating Countries
1. Exercise Tarang Shakti                India and its neighboring countries only
2. Exercise Pitch Black                  Hosted by the Indian Air Force
3. Exercise Udara Shakti                 India and Thailand
4. MITRA SHAKTI                         India and Sri Lanka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Tarang Shakti involved participants from major Asian nations, not just India's neighbors, making pair 1 incorrect. Exercise Pitch Black is hosted by Australia, not the Indian Air Force, making pair 2 incorrect. Exercise Udara Shakti is indeed a joint exercise between India and Thailand, making pair 3 correct.  MITRA SHAKTI is a joint military exercise between India and Thailand, not Sri Lanka, making pair 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Missile/Weapon System                Feature
1. GAURAV                               Surface-to-air supersonic cruise missile
2. INS Arighaat                          Aircraft Carrier
3. INS Arihant                           Submarine


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GAURAV is a surface-to-surface, not surface-to-air, supersonic cruise missile, making pair 1 partially correct in terms of its type and speed. INS Arighaat is a frigate, not an aircraft carrier, making pair 2 incorrect. INS Arihant is correctly identified as a submarine, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are partially correct, but only 3 is fully correct.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                Provision Related To
1. Article 72                         Powers of the President regarding pardons
2. Article 137                        Review petitions in the Supreme Court
3. Article 280                        Establishment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 282                        Discretionary Grants

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(c) 1, 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 correctly outlines the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc. Article 137 correctly refers to the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments. Article 280 correctly mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission. Article 282 accurately describes the provision for discretionary grants. Therefore, all pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                    Role/Function
1. Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) : Handles grievances through CPGRAMS
2. Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat :  A designated nodal agency for handling grievances
3.  CAG                                 Audits of Local Bodies through ELFA/DLFA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

DARPG plays a crucial role in grievance redressal through the CPGRAMS portal, making pair 1 correct. The Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat is indeed a designated nodal agency for handling grievances, making pair 2 correct.  The CAG's role in auditing local bodies through ELFA/DLFA is also accurate, making pair 3 correct.  Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.


**1. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

     Scheme Feature
1. CSSs Funding Pattern for Core Schemes in 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States : Centre:State is 50:50
2. CSSs Funding Pattern for Core Schemes in Other States                         : Centre:State is 70:30
3. CSSs Current framework                                                          : Based on the report by Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015)
4. CSSs Monitoring                                                                : Solely under the jurisdiction of NITI Aayog

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).  The funding patterns for core schemes are incorrectly represented in pairs 1 and 2.  The actual funding pattern for the 8 Northeastern states and 3 Himalayan states is 90:10 (Centre:State), and for other states it's 60:40 (Centre:State). Pair 4 is also incorrect; while NITI Aayog plays a significant role in monitoring CSSs, it doesn't have sole jurisdiction.  The Ministry of Finance also has a crucial role in budgetary allocation and oversight.  The incorrect options highlight common misconceptions about the financial distribution and governance structure of CSSs.  Understanding the nuances of Centre-State fiscal relations is crucial for comprehending India's federal structure and developmental policies.  The question tests the examinee's ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information related to CSSs, thereby assessing their analytical and evaluative skills.


**2. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

    Campaign Element                    Specific Detail
1.  Aim                                   : To increase government control over panchayat development
2.  Implementation Tier                 : Only at the Gram Panchayat level
3.  Components                            : Includes only Ward Sabhas and Gram Sabhas
4.  Preparation of GPDP                  :  Based solely on data from the Panchayat Development Index (PDI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's aim is to accelerate *people's participation* in Panchayat Development Plan preparation, not to increase government control (pair 1).  The Abhiyan is implemented at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District) – not just at the Gram Panchayat level (pair 2).  Its components include various types of Sabhas (Ward, Mahila, Gram, Block, District) (pair 3).  Finally, while PDI informs the identification of thematic developmental gaps, the preparation of GPDP involves a broader approach using a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach', incorporating various other inputs besides PDI data (pair 4).  The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately inaccurate details about the Abhiyan's objectives and implementation, testing the candidate's knowledge of grassroots governance initiatives and their understanding of participatory development. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.



**3. With reference to the Auditing of Local Bodies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Act                              Characteristic
1.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL)  : Established under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts
2.  AuditOnline application                                  : Awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023
3.  CAG’s mandate for audit of Local Bodies                :  Derived from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971
4.  Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)                 : Operates independently of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The AuditOnline application did indeed receive the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies originates from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971. Pair 1 is incorrect because iCAL is a collaborative platform inaugurated recently, not established under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, which provide the framework for local self-governance. Pair 4 is incorrect as ELFAs/DLFAs work *under* the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not independently. The incorrect options test the candidate's understanding of the institutional framework for auditing local bodies in India, requiring them to discern between the roles and functions of various entities involved in the process.  The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills related to India's governance structure.


**4. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Organization                         Feature
1.  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 :  Based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration
2.  Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC)  : Constituted by the Ministry of Law and Justice
3.  New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019 :  Facilitates institutional arbitration
4.  Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA)              :  Established by the United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is indeed based on the UNCITRAL Model Law. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, aims to facilitate institutional arbitration.  Pair 2 is incorrect because the MCPC was constituted by the Supreme Court of India, not the Ministry of Law and Justice.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the PCA was established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes (1899), not the United Nations.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate information about the legal framework and institutions related to ADR, testing the candidate's knowledge of both domestic and international dispute resolution mechanisms. This question assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**5. With reference to the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) - Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Mission Karmayogi                Detail
1.  NPCSCB's Aim                              : To exclusively train IAS officers
2.  NPCSCB's Coverage                          : Includes all civil servants, including contractual employees
3.  Guiding Principles                         :  Focuses solely on rule-based training
4.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)          : Launched in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  NPCSCB does indeed cover all civil servants, including contractual employees. Pair 1 is incorrect; NPCSCB's aim is broader than just training IAS officers; it encompasses all civil servants.  Pair 3 is incorrect as a key guiding principle is a *shift* from rule-based to role-based training.  Pair 4 is incorrect; the CBC was launched in 2021, not 2022. The incorrect options offer plausible yet inaccurate details about Mission Karmayogi, testing the candidate's knowledge of civil service reforms and capacity-building initiatives in India.  The question evaluates factual recall and assesses the ability to distinguish accurate from inaccurate information regarding a significant government program.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                       Characteristic
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) : Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Capacity Building Commission (CBC)       :  Launched in 2021 as part of Mission Karmayogi
3. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies in India
4.  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)     :  Has powers to impose penalties for data breaches.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is indeed a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (as amended). The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was launched in 2021 as a key component of Mission Karmayogi, a national program for civil services capacity building. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies within India.  Finally, the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) possesses the authority to levy penalties on entities that violate data protection regulations, specifically in cases of data breaches.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect, omitting crucial and factually accurate pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Provision
1. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :  Developed AuditOnline application for online audit of panchayat accounts.
2.  The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885                 : Repealed by the Telecommunications Act, 2023
3.  The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933          : Repealed by the Telecommunications Act, 2023
4.  Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993     : Established the NHRC


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 established the framework for local self-governance, the development of the AuditOnline application was a later initiative by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrectly matched.  However, the Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933 were indeed repealed by the Telecommunications Act, 2023, making pairs 2 and 3 correct.  The Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, is correctly linked to the establishment of the NHRC, making pair 4 accurate.  Thus, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                           Key Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                         : Aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans.
2. Mission Karmayogi                         : Focuses on a competency-driven approach to capacity development.
3. Sevottam Model                             : Includes a module on Grievance Redressal Mechanism.
4.  People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)               : Rolled out as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective schemes and initiatives. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as the People’s Plan Campaign) explicitly aims to enhance public participation in the development of Panchayat Development Plans.  Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a competency-driven approach to civil service capacity building. The Sevottam Model, designed to improve public service delivery, incorporates a module focused on grievance redressal mechanisms.  Finally, the People’s Plan Campaign was indeed launched under the name ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018.  Therefore, option (d) is the only option that accurately matches all four pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Indian Fiscal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                     Description
1. Article 270                               :  Taxes levied and collected by the Union are distributed between the Union and States.
2. Article 275                               :  Centre provides grants-in-aid to states.
3. Article 280                               :  Provides for a Finance Commission to adjudicate resource sharing.
4. Article 293                               : States can borrow money from outside India.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Articles 270, 275, and 280 correctly describe the distribution of taxes between the Union and States, the provision of grants-in-aid by the Centre, and the establishment of the Finance Commission, respectively.  However, Article 293 permits states to borrow within India, not outside.  Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) either incorrectly include or exclude the correctly matched pairs.  Option (b) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs, making it the correct answer.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                           Location/Jurisdiction
1.  International Seabed Authority (ISA)       : Kingston, Jamaica
2.  BIMSTEC Permanent Secretariat           : Dhaka, Bangladesh
3.  NHRC                                      : New Delhi
4.  iCAL                                      : Rajkot, Gujarat


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The International Seabed Authority (ISA) is headquartered in Kingston, Jamaica.  The BIMSTEC Permanent Secretariat is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is based in New Delhi.  Finally, the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, leading to option (d) as the correct answer.  The other options are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article             Provision Related To
1. Article 72                        :   President's power to grant pardons in cases involving court-martial sentences
2. Article 137                       :   Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments
3. Article 142                       :   Supreme Court's power to do complete justice
4. Article 280                       :   Establishment of the Finance Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This explicitly includes sentences awarded by court-martials, making pair 1 correct. Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments,  a crucial aspect of judicial review, making pair 2 incorrect.  Article 142 grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice, which is a broad power allowing the court to issue orders necessary for achieving justice in specific cases; this makes pair 3 correct.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States, making pair 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                      Key Feature
1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) :   Established under the Nirbhaya Fund
2. Consumer Protection Act (CPA) 2019 :   Includes online transactions in the definition of 'consumer'
3. Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 :   Replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
4. Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 :   Regulates processing of digital personal data

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are indeed funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at speedy disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases, making pair 1 correct. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, significantly broadened the definition of 'consumer' to include those who buy goods or services online or through electronic means, making pair 2 correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, focuses on regulating digital personal data, not replacing the Indian Evidence Act; that was done by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, making pair 3 incorrect. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, replaced the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Area Provision           Characteristic
1. Fifth Schedule                       :   Applicability to specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram
2. Sixth Schedule                       :   Establishment of Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)
3. Article 244(2)                     :   Empowers the Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
4. PESA Act 1996                      :  Applicable to Fifth Schedule areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Schedule deals with the administration of Scheduled Areas in several states, but the Sixth Schedule specifically applies to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, making pair 1 incorrect and pair 5 correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs, making pair 3 correct.  Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) are associated with the Fifth Schedule, not the Sixth, making pair 2 incorrect. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) applies to Fifth Schedule areas, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                   Key Provision
1. Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1973 :   Mandatory forensic investigation for offences punishable with at least seven years imprisonment
2. Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 :   Provision for Zero FIR
3. Limitation Act, 1963                    :   Doctrine of harmonious construction applied to Sections 3 and 5
4. Indian Passport Act, 1920                :   Three classes of passports issued (Ordinary, Diplomatic, Official)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CrPC 1973 indeed mandates forensic investigation for offences with at least seven years imprisonment, making pair 1 correct. The Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, introduced the provision for Zero FIRs, making pair 2 correct. The Supreme Court's application of the doctrine of harmonious construction to Sections 3 and 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, is a well-established legal principle, making pair 3 correct.  The Indian Passport Act, 1920, does indeed outline three classes of passports: Ordinary, Diplomatic, and Official, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                       Characteristic
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :   Deals with complaints related to Scheduled Castes
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Conducts civil services examinations
3. State Finance Commission                 :   Adjudicates sharing of resources between Union and States
4. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)       :   Deals with corruption complaints against government officials
5. NITI Aayog                              :   Replaced the Planning Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NCSC deals with complaints related to Scheduled Castes, making pair 1 correct. The UPSC conducts the civil services examination, making pair 2 correct. The State Finance Commission advises on the distribution of state finances, not the Union and State distribution, making pair 3 incorrect. The CVC deals with corruption complaints against government officials, making pair 4 correct. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, making pair 5 correct. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                    Related Subject
1. Article 72                               :   Presidential Pardon
2. Article 137                              :   Review Petition in Supreme Court
3. Article 142                              :   Curative Petition in Supreme Court
4. Article 280                              :   Finance Commission
5. Article 244(2)                           :   Fifth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and the States.  The statement regarding Article 142 being related to curative petitions is incorrect; Article 142 deals with the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice.  Article 244(2) pertains to the Sixth Schedule, not the Fifth Schedule, which deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                     Function/Characteristic
1. Department of Personnel and Training  :   Coordinating agency for RTI Act implementation
2. Central Information Commission          :   Appoints Central Public Information Officers (PIOs)
3. Madras High Court                       :   Ruled that cooperative societies are Public Authorities under RTI Act
4. Supreme Court                          :   Declared the Office of Chief Justice of India a Public Authority
5.  Universal Declaration of Human Rights:  Articulates RTI as a fundamental right


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is indeed the coordinating agency for the RTI Act. The Supreme Court has ruled that the Office of the Chief Justice of India is a Public Authority under the RTI Act.  However, the Central Information Commission (CIC) does not appoint PIOs; it oversees their functioning and handles appeals. The Madras High Court ruled that cooperative societies are *not* Public Authorities under the RTI Act. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights articulates the right to information, but not specifically as a *fundamental* right in the Indian context.  Thus, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Cantonment Related Entity                 Characteristic/Fact
1. Cantonment Act, 2006                    :   Administered under the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act
2. Barrackpore                               :   First Cantonment established in 1765
3. Ministry of Defence                       :   Under administrative control of Cantonment Boards
4. Station Commander                        :   Ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board
5.  East India Company                     :   Established Cantonments after the Battle of Plassey


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Barrackpore was indeed the first cantonment established in 1765. The Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board. The East India Company established cantonments after the Battle of Plassey.  However, the Cantonment Act, 2006, is administered in accordance with the 74th, not the 73rd, Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies.  The Ministry of Defence is responsible for the *overall* administration, not the Cantonment Boards themselves. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.



**4. With reference to the  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

   Statement                                 Correctness
1. It replaces the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 :   True
2. It regulates the processing of digital personal data:  True
3. It provides for measures to protect users from specified messages: True
4. It brings OTT platforms under its regulatory purview: False
5. It establishes a new fund called Digital Bharat Nidhi: False


Which of the statements given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, primarily aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data and includes provisions for user protection, such as mechanisms to deal with unwanted messages. However, it does *not* replace the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 (that is done by the Telecommunications Act, 2023), nor does it regulate OTT platforms or establish a new fund called Digital Bharat Nidhi (that is done by the Telecommunications Act, 2023). Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision                              Description
1. Mercy Petition                               :  Governed by Article 72
2. Curative Petition                           :  Last constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)          :  Exclusively handle POCSO Act cases
4.  Nirbhaya Fund                             :  Funds FTSCs under a centrally sponsored scheme
5.  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:  Cases handled by FTSCs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 correctly governs the President's power regarding mercy petitions. Curative petitions are indeed the last resort after review petitions are dismissed. The Nirbhaya Fund finances the FTSCs, which handle cases under the POCSO Act. While many FTSCs handle POCSO Act cases, it is not *exclusive* to them.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.





**1. With reference to the functioning of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Act                                 Feature
1. Santhanam Committee                     :   Established the CBI in 1963
2. Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946 :  Governs the CBI's operations
3. Ministry of Home Affairs                  :   Oversees the CBI's activities
4. Article 131 of the Constitution          :   Deals with disputes between the Centre and States involving the CBI


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Santhanam Committee on Prevention of Corruption (1962-64) recommended the establishment of the CBI, which was subsequently formed in 1963.  The Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, provides the legal framework for the CBI's functioning as a premier investigating agency.  While the CBI falls under the Ministry of Personnel, Pension & Public Grievances,  the Ministry of Home Affairs is not directly involved in its daily operations. Article 131 of the Constitution is relevant because the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction extends to disputes between the Union and States, including cases where the CBI's actions are challenged, as seen in the West Bengal vs. Union of India case.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete or inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

   Program/Initiative                        Characteristic
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                       :   Launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas'
2. Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)     :   Prepared for the fiscal year 2025-26 under the Abhiyan
3.  Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) :   Published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal after approval
4.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI)       :   Used to identify thematic developmental gaps at the block level only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas', aims to enhance people's participation in creating Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  These PDPs, specifically for 2025-26, are prepared at various levels, including the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP), which is published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal after receiving approval. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to identify thematic developmental gaps at all levels of Panchayats, not just the block level. Thus, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act                              Role/Function
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Established in Rajkot, Gujarat
2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)           :   Mandate for auditing local bodies comes from the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts
3. AuditOnline application                         :   Developed by the Ministry of Rural Development
4. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) / Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA): Works under the technical guidance of the Union Ministry of Finance


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, not the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, which deal with local self-governance. AuditOnline is a panchayat account auditing application developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. ELFA/DLFA work under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not the Union Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to fiscal federalism in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision/Body            Function/Responsibility
1. Article 246                               :   Divides tax powers between the Union and States
2. Article 270                               :   Deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union
3. Article 275                               :   Relates to grants-in-aid from the Centre to States
4. 15th Finance Commission                   :   Recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states based on income distance, area, and population only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 246 of the Indian Constitution outlines the division of powers to levy and collect taxes between the Union and the States. Article 270 deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain Union taxes between the Union and the States. Article 275 concerns grants-in-aid from the Union to States. However, the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations for the distribution of the divisible pool among states included factors beyond income distance, area, and population; it also considered demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State/Union Territory                    Characteristic
1. Andhra Pradesh                           :   Demanded SCS recently
2. Bihar                                   :   Demanded SCS recently
3. Fifth Finance Commission                  :   First introduced the concept of SCS in 1969
4. Jammu & Kashmir (pre-2019)             :   Granted SCS in 1969


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Andhra Pradesh and Bihar have both recently demanded Special Category Status. The Fifth Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS in 1969. Jammu and Kashmir was among the states granted SCS in 1969.  All the pairs are correctly matched.


**6. Consider the following pairs related to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

   Entity/Provision                            Function/Feature
1. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)    :   Imposes penalties for non-compliance with the Act
2. Data Principal                              :   Has the right to seek correction and erasure of personal data
3. Data Fiduciary                             :   Must ensure data accuracy and build reasonable security safeguards
4. Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)       :   Are exempted from all obligations under the Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) has the power to impose penalties for violations of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.  Data principals have the right to seek corrections and erasure of their personal data. Data fiduciaries have the responsibility to maintain data accuracy and implement security measures.  However, Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) are not exempted from all obligations; they have additional obligations, including appointing a data protection officer and an independent data auditor.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Provision                               Feature/Responsibility
1. Public Information Officer (PIO)           :   Responsible for providing information under the Act
2. Central Information Commission (CIC)       :   Hears appeals against decisions of PIOs
3. Section 8 of the RTI Act                    :   Specifies exemptions from information disclosure
4.  RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019                :   Established the office of Chief Information Commissioner


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Information Officer (PIO) is the designated individual responsible for handling requests under the RTI Act. The Central Information Commission (CIC) hears appeals when requests are denied or inadequately addressed. Section 8 of the RTI Act outlines exemptions from disclosure.  The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, modified the terms and conditions of employment for Information Commissioners, but it did not establish the office of Chief Information Commissioner; that office was created under the original RTI Act. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Entity                             Characteristic
1.  Spectrum Allocation                          :   Primarily through auction, with some administrative allocation for specified uses
2. Right of Way (RoW) framework              :   Grants RoW on a discriminatory and exclusive basis for telecom infrastructure
3. Digital Bharat Nidhi                         :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund
4.  Over-the-top (OTT) platforms               :   Regulated under the Telecommunications Act, 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, primarily allocates spectrum through auctions, though administrative allocation is permitted for certain purposes like national security and disaster management.  The RoW framework aims for non-discriminatory and non-exclusive access.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund.  Importantly, OTT platforms are *not* regulated under this Act.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**9. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Area/Territory                                  Status/Regulation
1.  Arunachal Pradesh                            :   Entirely designated as a Protected Area
2.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands                    :   Entirely designated as a Restricted Area
3.  Sikkim                                      :   Partly Protected, partly Restricted Area
4.  Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963    :   Governs access to Protected Areas only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area. Sikkim has a dual status, with parts designated as Protected and Restricted areas.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs access to both Protected and Restricted Areas.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Feature                                 Characteristic
1. Aadhaar Card                                  :   Authoritative proof of date of birth
2. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) :   Issues Aadhaar cards
3. 12-digit unique identification number           :   Can be deactivated or omitted by UIDAI
4.  Supreme Court of India                        :   Ruled Aadhaar is authoritative proof of date of birth


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UIDAI issues Aadhaar cards, and the 12-digit unique identification number can be deactivated or omitted by the UIDAI. However, the Supreme Court has explicitly stated that Aadhaar is *not* an authoritative proof of date of birth.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision                    Related Power/Application
1. Article 72                               :   Granting pardons to individuals convicted by a court-martial
2. Article 137                               :   Review of a curative petition by the Supreme Court
3. Article 142                               :   Power to do complete justice in specific cases
4. Article 280                               :   Appointment of the President of India
5. Article 292                               :   Union government's power to borrow money internationally

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 explicitly grants the President of India the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or remit sentences, including those given by court-martials.  Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, which is a broader power than just reviewing curative petitions; the review of a curative petition falls under its inherent powers but is not the sole definition of Article 142. Article 292 deals with the borrowing powers of the Union government, explicitly mentioning borrowing within and outside India. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, not the appointment of the President. Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments, not curative petitions directly.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court/Institution                        Type of Petition/Remedy
1. Supreme Court                           :   Zero FIR
2.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)      :   Mercy Petition
3.  Gram Nyayalayas                        :   Curative Petition
4.  High Courts                             :   Civil Contempt
5.  Arbitral Tribunal                        :   Condonation of Delay


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

High Courts, under Article 215, possess the power to punish for contempt of court, including civil contempt.  The other pairings are incorrect: Zero FIRs are registered by police stations, not the Supreme Court; FTSCs deal with specific types of cases but don't inherently handle mercy petitions; Gram Nyayalayas focus on local dispute resolution, not curative petitions; and arbitral tribunals may deal with condonation of delay, but it's not their exclusive function. The Supreme Court is involved in hearing petitions related to various issues (Curative petition, Mercy petition, etc.)  but does not exclusively deal with them. Therefore, only pair 4 is accurately matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Institution             Description/Function
1.  Vertical Devolution                      :   Distribution of funds among states based on income distance
2.  Horizontal Devolution                    :   Share of states from the divisible pool
3.  Grants-in-Aid                            :   Provided under Article 292
4.  Finance Commission                       :   Adjudicates sharing of resources between Union and States
5.  Article 282                              :   Empowers states to borrow money abroad

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission, as established by Article 280, plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of resources between the Union and State governments.  The other options are mismatched: Vertical devolution involves the share from the divisible pool, not income distance-based distribution; Horizontal devolution is the distribution among states, not the share from the divisible pool; Grants-in-aid are given under Article 275, not Article 292; and Article 282 allows discretionary grants, not the power for states to borrow internationally. Thus, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   State Classification/Provision            Characteristic/Feature
1.  Special Category Status (SCS)           :   Based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
2.  Sixth Schedule Areas                    :   Governed by Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)
3.  Article 371                               :   Provides for special provisions for several states
4.  Article 244(2)                           :   Creation of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in specified areas
5.  Article 341(2)                           :   Empowers the President to specify castes as Scheduled Castes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Special Category Status (SCS) was historically associated with the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for grants. Article 371 provides for various special provisions for specific states. The other pairs are incorrect: Sixth Schedule areas are administered by ADCs and ARCs, not TACs; Article 244(2) is related to the Sixth Schedule, not the creation of ADCs; and Article 341(1), not 341(2), empowers the President to specify Scheduled Castes.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine/Principle                  Explanation/Application
1. Doctrine of Coverture                     :   Treats a married woman as a separate legal entity
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction     :   Provides for resolving conflicts between sections of an Act
3.  Contempt of Court                       :   Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
4.  Principles of Natural Justice            :   Bind Gram Nyayalayas in their proceedings
5.  Substantive Equality                    :   Ensures equal opportunities regardless of background

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The doctrine of harmonious construction is used to reconcile conflicting provisions within a statute. Contempt of Court is indeed defined by the 1971 Act. Gram Nyayalayas are guided by principles of natural justice.  Substantive equality aims to address historical injustices. The Doctrine of Coverture is the opposite of the statement given, it treats a married woman as one entity with her husband. Therefore, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Provision/Feature
1. Post Office Act, 2023                           :   Repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998
2.  Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993   :   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)
3.  Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023:   Established the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)
4. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA)     :  Regulates the acceptance of foreign funds by NGOs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Post Office Act, 2023, explicitly repeals the 1998 Act, streamlining postal services governance. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is the foundational legislation establishing the NHRC, a crucial institution for safeguarding human rights in India.  The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, created the DPBI to oversee the implementation and enforcement of data protection regulations.  Finally, the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) directly governs the acceptance and utilization of foreign funds by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) in India. Each Act listed has a direct and clearly defined relationship with the feature mentioned in the corresponding pair.  There are no discrepancies or alternative interpretations possible.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                          Key Feature/Provision
1.  Cantonments Act, 2006                          :  Administered by Cantonment Boards under the Ministry of Defence
2.  Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005           :   Replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002
3.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC)                     :   Enforceable through provisions in statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951
4.  Companies Act, 1956                           :  Used for setting up the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate pairings of Acts/Laws with their key features or provisions.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, indeed governs the administration of Cantonment Boards, which fall under the Ministry of Defence's purview.  The RTI Act, 2005, is correctly identified as the successor to the 2002 Freedom of Information Act. While the Model Code of Conduct lacks direct statutory backing, its violations can be addressed through existing laws such as the Representation of the People Act, 1951, which makes the third pair correct.  Finally, the Companies Act, 1956, provides the legal framework under which the CSC SPV was established, making the fourth pair accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Commission                                 Characteristic/Function
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)      :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)       :  Conducts the Civil Services Examination
3.  State Finance Commission                       :  Advises on the distribution of financial resources between state government and local bodies
4. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)            :  Deals with corruption cases within the central government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the four pairs accurately links a constitutional/statutory/executive body with its primary function or defining characteristic. The NHRC's establishment under the Protection of Human Rights Act is well-documented.  The UPSC's role in conducting the Civil Services Examination is a fundamental aspect of its mandate.  State Finance Commissions are specifically tasked with advising on the distribution of financial resources between state governments and local bodies.  Finally, the CVC's core function involves investigating and addressing corruption within the central government.  The options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Passport                                 Color
1. Ordinary Passport                              :   Blue
2. Diplomatic Passport                           :   White
3. Official Passport                              :   Maroon


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  In India, passports are categorized and color-coded to differentiate their usage and the holder's status.  Ordinary passports, issued to the general public, are blue. Diplomatic passports, for diplomats and high-ranking officials, are white.  Official passports, for government officials on official business, are maroon. The options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect, as they exclude correctly matched pairs. Option (d) is also incorrect because all three pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Area Type                                       Location Example
1. Protected Area                                 :   Arunachal Pradesh (entire state)
2. Restricted Area                                :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands (entire Union Territory)
3.  Cantonment                                    :   Barrackpore (established in 1765)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963,  limiting foreign access.  Similarly, the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands Union Territory is classified as a Restricted Area, requiring special permits for foreign entry.  Finally, Barrackpore is historically significant as the first cantonment established in India in 1765.  Options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect because they omit correctly matched pairs, and (d) is incorrect as all three are correct.


**1. With reference to the Indian legal framework concerning data protection and the right to be forgotten, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                      Legal Instrument/Provision
1. Right to be Forgotten                       :   Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
2. Regulation of Digital Personal Data        :    European GDPR law
3.  Origin of Right to be Forgotten           :   French jurisprudence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, a significant piece of legislation in India, notably does *not* explicitly include the "right to be forgotten."  This right, stemming from the broader concept of the "right to oblivion" in French jurisprudence, is a key feature of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect because the DPDP Act does not enshrine the right to be forgotten. Pair 2 is correct as the GDPR explicitly addresses the right to be forgotten, allowing individuals to request the deletion of their personal data under certain conditions. Pair 3 is also correct as the concept's origins trace back to French jurisprudence's "right to oblivion," which emphasizes an individual's control over their personal information and its dissemination.  Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate the right to be forgotten with the wrong legal instrument or misrepresent the origins of the concept.  Understanding the nuances of data protection laws across jurisdictions is crucial for the UPSC exam.


**2. With reference to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State/Territory                          ILP Status/Provision
1. Arunachal Pradesh                      :   Not eligible for ILP
2. Sikkim                                   : Partially in Protected Area, partially in Restricted Area
3.  Nagaland (Chumoukedima, Niuland, Dimapur): ILP implementation approved
4. Manipur                                 : Under ILP system
5.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands              : Declared as a Restricted Area


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is a state where the ILP system is in operation, making statement 1 incorrect. Sikkim is indeed partially in a Protected Area and partially in a Restricted Area, making statement 2 correct. The Nagaland government's approval for ILP implementation in the specified districts makes statement 3 correct. Manipur is also under the ILP system, making statement 4 correct. Finally, the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are correctly identified as a Restricted Area, making statement 5 correct.  Thus, only option (d) encompasses all the correctly matched pairs.  The other options incorrectly classify at least one state/territory's ILP status or area classification. A thorough understanding of the ILP system, its geographical application, and the legal frameworks governing it are vital for the UPSC examination, highlighting the importance of detailed knowledge of administrative and governance structures in India.


**3. With reference to the Indian fiscal federalism structure, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision/Concept              Feature/Description
1. Article 280                               :   Empowers the President to grant pardons
2.  15th Finance Commission Recommendations:  41% share of divisible pool to states
3. Article 275                               :   Deals with Grants-in-Aid to states
4. Seventh Schedule                           :  Delineates tax bases between Union and States
5. Article 292                               :  Governs state government borrowing from abroad


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 280 correctly establishes the Finance Commission's role in adjudicating resource sharing, not presidential pardons (which is covered by Article 72).  The 15th Finance Commission did indeed recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states. Article 275 accurately pertains to grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to states. The Seventh Schedule correctly outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and states. However, Article 292 deals with the Union government's borrowing powers, both domestically and internationally; state governments can only borrow within India, without prior consent of Union Government if indebted to it. Therefore, statement 5 is incorrect.  Option (d) accurately captures the correctly matched pairs. The other options incorrectly pair constitutional provisions or concepts with their functions.  The intricacies of fiscal federalism and constitutional provisions related to it are frequently tested in the UPSC exam, demanding a comprehensive understanding of the distribution of powers and resources within the Indian federal system.


**4.  With reference to the legal remedies available in the Indian judicial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Remedy                                     Description/Feature
1. Curative Petition                              :   First remedy available after review petition dismissal
2. Mercy Petition                                 :  Power vested in the President under Article 72
3. Contempt of Court                             :  Defined under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)          :   Primarily deal with cases under the IT Act
5. Gram Nyayalayas                               :  Jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal petty disputes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

A curative petition is the last resort after a review petition's dismissal, making statement 1 incorrect.  The President's power to grant pardons and commute sentences is correctly linked to Article 72 in statement 2. The definition of contempt of court falls under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, making statement 3 incorrect. FTSCs primarily handle rape and POCSO Act cases, not IT Act cases, making statement 4 incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas do indeed have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal petty disputes, making statement 5 correct.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 5 are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly classify at least one legal remedy or its feature.  A solid understanding of the various legal remedies and their processes is essential for the UPSC exam, requiring in-depth knowledge of the Indian judicial system and its procedures.


**5. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, and related amendments, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Provision/Feature
1. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019         :   Conferred citizenship to those who migrated from East Pakistan to Assam between 1950 and 1971
2. Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024          :   Enforces provisions of the Citizenship Act of 1955
3. Citizenship Act, 1955                          :   Established the Foreigners' Tribunal
4. Assam Accord, 1985                           :   Defined the cut-off date for determining citizenship in Assam as March 24, 1971
5. Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964            :   Established Foreigners' Tribunals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide citizenship to religious minorities who had migrated from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan, but the time frame mentioned in option 1 is incorrect. making statement 1 incorrect. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, indeed aim to implement the CAA, 2019, making statement 2 correct.  The Citizenship Act, 1955, does not establish Foreigners' Tribunals; that's done by the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, making statement 3 incorrect. The Assam Accord correctly established March 24, 1971, as the cut-off date for citizenship determination in Assam, making statement 4 correct.  The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, accurately established the Foreigners' Tribunals, making statement 5 correct. Therefore, only options 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair at least one act/amendment with its provision/feature.  A comprehensive understanding of the Citizenship Act, its amendments, and related legal instruments is crucial for the UPSC exam, requiring familiarity with the legislative history and the implications of these legal frameworks.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Data Protection Body (DPBI) Function                    :   Specific Responsibility
1. Monitoring compliance and imposing penalties         :   Hearing grievances made by affected persons
2. Directing data fiduciaries in data breaches           :   Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data
3. Hearing grievances made by affected persons          :   Appointing a data protection officer (for SDFs)
4. Ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data       :   Informing DPBI and affected persons of a breach

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The DPBI's functions are distinct and not interchangeable as presented in the options.  Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** While the DPBI *does* monitor compliance and impose penalties, this is separate from its grievance-hearing function.  These are distinct actions under its purview.

2. **Incorrect:**  Directing data fiduciaries in data breach situations is a key DPBI responsibility, but it's not directly linked to ensuring data accuracy.  Data accuracy is a responsibility of the data fiduciary itself, not the DPBI's primary role in breach response.

3. **Incorrect:**  The DPBI hears grievances, but appointing a data protection officer is an additional obligation specifically for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs), not a general DPBI function.

4. **Incorrect:**  The DPBI doesn't directly ensure data accuracy; that's the responsibility of the data fiduciary. The DPBI's role is more about oversight and enforcement.  Informing the DPBI and affected persons about a breach is a different responsibility of the data fiduciary.


The options are designed to test the understanding of the distinct roles and responsibilities of the DPBI and data fiduciaries, highlighting the crucial distinction between proactive data management (accuracy) and reactive breach response.  The correct answer emphasizes the independent nature of each function of the DPBI.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Jan Yojana Abhiyan Component                     :   Specific Objective
1. Structured Ward/Mahila/Gram Sabha               :   Publication of approved GPDPs on e-Gram Swaraj portal
2. Preparation of Gram Sabha-wise calendar        :   Engagement of youth and elderly in GPDP preparation
3. Identification of thematic developmental gaps    :   Accelerating people’s participation in PDP preparation
4. Inclusive participation (youth and elderly)      :   Assessment of Panchayat Development through PDI

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** Structured Sabhas are a key component of Jan Yojana Abhiyan, but their primary purpose isn't the publication of GPDPs on e-Gram Swaraj.  Publication is a later step in the process.

2. **Incorrect:** Preparing a Gram Sabha calendar is a step in planning, but it's not directly connected to the engagement of youth and elderly, though this engagement occurs within the framework of the calendar.

3. **Correct:** Identifying thematic developmental gaps based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is a core aim of the structured Sabhas to inform the development plans.  This directly relates to the overall objective of accelerating people's participation in plan preparation.

4. **Incorrect:** Inclusive participation (engaging youth and the elderly) is a component to improve the quality of planning, but the assessment of Panchayats' development is done through the PDI, which informs the identification of developmental gaps, not directly through participation.

The question tests understanding of the sequential steps and interconnected objectives within the Jan Yojana Abhiyan. The distractors highlight the close relationship between different components, making it challenging to differentiate the direct and indirect connections between components and their objectives.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Auditing of Local Bodies Entity              :   Specific Function/Responsibility
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Online audit of panchayat accounts
2. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)         :   Setting global standards for auditing local governance
3. AuditOnline application                       :   Exercises control and supervision over local body accounts
4. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)       :   Capacity building of auditors

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.

1. **Incorrect:** iCAL's role is to set global standards and serve as a center of excellence for capacity building, not to conduct online audits of panchayat accounts. That is the function of AuditOnline.

2. **Correct:** The CAG, through its established mechanisms, exercises control and supervision over the proper maintenance of accounts and auditing for all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

3. **Correct:** AuditOnline is specifically designed for conducting online audits of panchayat accounts, ensuring accountability in the utilization of funds at the ground level.

4. **Incorrect:** ELFA/DLFA audit the utilization of funds granted by the state government to local bodies, they don't directly engage in capacity building of auditors. That's the role of iCAL.

The question aims to assess the understanding of the different entities involved in auditing local bodies and their specific roles, testing knowledge of both established mechanisms (CAG, ELFA) and newer initiatives (iCAL, AuditOnline). Distractors are carefully chosen to reflect the interconnectedness of these entities, requiring a precise understanding of each entity's distinct responsibilities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   CBI Related Entity/Aspect                  :   Specific Detail
1. Santhanam Committee                        :   Established in 1963
2. Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 :   Governs the CBI
3. Article 131                               :   Deals with Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in Centre-State disputes
4. Ministry of Personnel, Pension & Public Grievances :   The CBI's motto: Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Santhanam Committee recommended the establishment of the CBI, but the CBI was established in 1963, not the committee itself.

2. **Correct:** The DSPE Act, 1946, is the legal framework governing the CBI's operations.

3. **Correct:** Article 131 of the Constitution outlines the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction in disputes between the Union and States, a context relevant to recent CBI-related Supreme Court cases.

4. **Incorrect:** The Ministry of Personnel, Pension & Public Grievances is the administrative ministry for the CBI, but the CBI's motto ("Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity") is not associated with the ministry itself.


The question tests the knowledge of the organizational structure, legal basis, and constitutional context of the CBI.  The distractors are carefully chosen to include closely related but incorrect information (the Santhanam Committee's role, the ministry's relationship to the CBI), requiring a precise understanding of the facts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative Related Entity            :   Specific Characteristic/Feature
1. Mission Karmayogi                           :   Focuses on rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)
2. Capacity Building Commission (CBC)           :   Part of National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB)
3. Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015) :   Launched in 2019
4. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)        :   Funding routed through Consolidated Fund of the State

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's examine each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** Mission Karmayogi focuses on capacity building for civil servants, not directly on the rationalization of CSSs.  While there might be indirect links, the primary focus is different.

2. **Correct:** The CBC was indeed launched as part of the NPCSCB, which is the umbrella initiative under Mission Karmayogi.

3. **Incorrect:** The Sub-Group of Chief Ministers' report on CSS rationalization was released in 2015.  It provided the basis for the current CSS framework, but the Sub-group itself wasn't "launched" in 2019.

4. **Correct:** All transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.

The question tests knowledge of different government initiatives and their interrelationships, requiring precise understanding of the characteristics of each scheme and the timeline of their implementation. The distractors are cleverly designed to include related concepts, making it challenging to differentiate the correct from the incorrect pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                 Provision Related To
1. Article 72                           :   President's power on mercy petitions for offences against Union laws
2. Article 137                          :   Supreme Court's review power over its own judgments
3. Article 142                          :   Supreme Court's power to do complete justice
4. Article 244(2)                       :   Provisions relating to the Sixth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 explicitly grants the President of India the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences, including death sentences, in cases where the sentence is given by a court-martial or for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments, a crucial aspect of judicial review. Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to pass orders necessary for doing complete justice, including issuing curative petitions as a last resort.  Finally, Article 244(2) deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states, as detailed in the Sixth Schedule. All four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme/Institution              Key Feature/Objective
1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) :   Launched in 2019 to expedite POCSO Act cases
2. Digital Personal Data Protection Act:   Regulates processing of digital personal data
3. Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023:   Replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
4. Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024:   Provides for venue-in-charge action on unfair means

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) were indeed launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data to protect individuals' rights. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, is a replacement for the antiquated Indian Evidence Act of 1872. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, outline procedures for dealing with unfair means in public examinations, including the role of venue-in-charge. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to governance mechanisms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Commission                     Mandate/Function
1. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):   Imposes penalties for data breaches
2. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):   Addresses grievances related to Scheduled Castes
3. Capacity Building Commission (CBC):   Part of Mission Karmayogi for civil service training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is responsible for monitoring compliance with data protection regulations and imposing penalties for violations, including data breaches. The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) is a constitutional body that investigates and addresses grievances related to the Scheduled Castes.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is integral to Mission Karmayogi, a significant initiative focused on improving the capacity and skills of Indian civil servants. All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Programme                     Key Characteristic
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                  :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
2. Special Category States (SCS)       :   Grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (historically)
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) :   Funding routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People's Plan Campaign, is primarily concerned with involving the public in preparing Panchayat Development Plans. Historically, Special Category States received central grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, although this has since changed.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) now route all transfers to states through the Consolidated Fund of the State. Thus, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. With reference to  Indian legal and administrative systems, consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Act                       Function/Provision
1.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):   Sets global standards for auditing local bodies
2.  Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:   Provides citizens with access to information held by public authorities
3.  Common Service Centres (CSCs)       :    A pan-India network for delivering government services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies. The Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities, promoting transparency and accountability. Common Service Centres (CSCs) form a nationwide network that delivers various government and private sector services to citizens, particularly in rural areas.  All three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                      Key Feature
1.  Public Accounts Committee :  Consists of 22 members from Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha
2. Estimates Committee        :  Consists of 30 members from Rajya Sabha
3. Committee on Official Languages:  Submits recommendations to the President regarding Hindi usage
4. Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha): Investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges in Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) indeed comprises a maximum of 22 members, with 15 from the Lok Sabha and 7 from the Rajya Sabha.  This makes option 1 correct.  The Estimates Committee consists of 30 members, all from the Lok Sabha, not Rajya Sabha as stated in option 2, making it incorrect. The Committee on Official Languages does submit recommendations to the President regarding the progress and implementation of Hindi for official purposes of the Union. This makes option 3 correct. Option 4 is incorrect because the Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges investigates breaches of privileges within the Rajya Sabha itself, not the Lok Sabha. Therefore, only options 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Election-Related Body/Concept       Characteristic
1. Model Code of Conduct (MCC)     :  Has statutory backing under the Representation of the People Act
2. Election Commission of India (ECI) :  Derives authority solely from Article 324 of the Constitution
3. Lok Sabha Elections              :  Employ a system of proportional representation
4. Gram Nyayalayas                  :  Handle both civil and criminal disputes at the village level


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) lacks statutory backing; its enforcement relies on conventions and the Election Commission's authority.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The Election Commission's authority stems primarily from Article 324, but also draws upon other constitutional provisions and legal frameworks for its functions, making option 2 incorrect. Lok Sabha elections utilize a first-past-the-post system, not proportional representation, making option 3 incorrect. Option 4 is correct as Gram Nyayalayas are indeed established to handle both civil and criminal disputes at the village level under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.


**3. With reference to the Indian Polity, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Committee                 Power or Function
1. Cabinet Committees                     :  Are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution
2.  Sixth Schedule of the Constitution   :  Empowers Governors to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)
3.  President's Address to Parliament      :  Mandated by Article 86 of the Constitution
4.  Parliamentary Committees              :  Derive authority solely from parliamentary conventions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cabinet Committees are extra-constitutional bodies, not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule empowers Governors to create ADCs and ARCs, making option 2 correct.  While the President can address Parliament, Article 87, not Article 86, specifies the occasions for this, making option 3 incorrect. Parliamentary Committees draw their authority from Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution, not solely from conventions, thus making option 4 incorrect.  Only option 2 accurately reflects the relationship between the institution and its power/function.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court-Related Concept/Procedure            Description
1. Contempt of Court                        : Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and punishes only civil contempt
2. Curative Petition                         :  The last resort for a litigant after review petition dismissal, based solely on Article 142
3. Mercy Petition                            :  Can be exercised by the President only for offences against Union laws
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)        :  Funded entirely by state governments


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Contempt of Court encompasses both civil and criminal contempt, as defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. Thus, option 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the last legal recourse after a review petition is rejected, and while Article 142 provides the foundation for the Supreme Court's power, other principles like natural justice also play a role. Therefore, option 2 is incorrect. The President's power to grant mercy extends to various offences, not solely those against Union laws, making option 3 incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, funded by the Centre from the Nirbhaya Fund, not solely by state governments, making option 4 incorrect.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                Feature/Objective
1.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan              :  Launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Rural Development
2.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI):  A multi-domain index assessing the financial performance of panchayats
3.  e-Gram Swaraj Portal             :  Used for publishing approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs)
4.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :  Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development, in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas'.  Therefore, option 1 is incorrect. The PDI is a multi-domain and multi-sectoral index assessing overall holistic development, not just financial performance, making option 2 incorrect.  e-Gram Swaraj is used to publish approved GPDPs, making option 3 correct.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, making option 4 correct.  Only options 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 3                        : Formation of new States
2. Article 72                       : Presidential powers on mercy petitions
3. Article 129 and Article 215     : Power of Supreme Court and High Courts to punish contempt
4. Article 137                      : Review petitions in Supreme Court
5. Article 244(2)                  : Sixth Schedule provisions for autonomous councils

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 3 of the Indian Constitution deals with the formation of new states and alteration of boundaries. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases, including death sentences. Articles 129 and 215 grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt of court. Article 137 allows for the review of judgments and orders of the Supreme Court. Finally, Article 244(2) forms the basis for the Sixth Schedule, which establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils in certain states.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Each pairing accurately reflects a direct and established constitutional provision.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                     Key Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008               :  Exempts Nagaland, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas
2. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971             : Defines civil and criminal contempt
3. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                :  Recently replaced by Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam
4. Official Languages Act, 1963             :  Established the Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages
5. PESA Act, 1996                           : Applicable to Fifth Schedule areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas from its jurisdiction. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework for dealing with contempt of court, defining both civil and criminal contempt.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has indeed been replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam. The Official Languages Act, 1963, led to the establishment of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages.  The PESA Act, 1996, is relevant to the Fifth Schedule areas, and not the sixth. Therefore, only the first four pairs are correctly matched.  Option (d) accurately reflects this.  The inclusion of the PESA Act as a correct match would be incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court/Petition                   Characteristic
1. Gram Nyayalaya                        : Mobile court with civil and criminal jurisdiction
2. Contempt Petition                      : Filed against delay in High Court Chief Justice appointment (Example: Jharkhand)
3. Curative Petition                       : Last constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)     :  Handle rape and POCSO Act cases
5. Foreigners Tribunal                     :  Power to declare a person a foreigner


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the provided pairs accurately describe the respective court or petition type. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed mobile courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction. Contempt petitions can be, and have been, filed to address delays in judicial appointments.  Curative petitions serve as the final avenue for legal redress in the Supreme Court after review petitions are dismissed. Fast-Track Special Courts are specifically designed to expedite the processing of rape and POCSO cases. Foreigners Tribunals possess the unique authority to declare individuals as foreigners. Each description is factual and directly reflects the function and nature of the entity described.  There is no ambiguity or room for misinterpretation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Parliamentary Committee                  Function/Characteristic
1. Public Accounts Committee               :  Auditing government revenue and expenditure
2. Estimates Committee                     : Suggests policy improvements for administrative efficiency
3. Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL): Reviews Hindi usage for official Union purposes
4. Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha) : Investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges
5. Cabinet Committees                       : Extra-constitutional, facilitating decision-making in specific areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the five pairs correctly links a parliamentary committee to its primary function or characteristic. The Public Accounts Committee scrutinizes government finances. The Estimates Committee assesses the efficiency of government spending and suggests improvements. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages focuses on the implementation and promotion of Hindi.  The Committee of Privileges investigates and addresses violations of parliamentary privileges. Cabinet Committees are indeed extra-constitutional bodies supporting the Cabinet's decision-making processes.  Therefore, all five pairs are accurate and correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer. There is no element of mismatching or inaccuracy in any pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Citizenship/Related Act        Provision/Feature
1. Citizenship by Naturalization          :  Requires adequate knowledge of a language from the 8th Schedule
2. Renunciation of Citizenship           :  Irrevocable declaration upon approval of Indian citizenship application
3. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019 :  Exempts specified illegal migrants from penal consequences
4. Overseas Citizen of India (OCI)        :  Central government can cancel OCI registration on specific grounds.
5. Foreigners Tribunal                     : Established under Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  Citizenship by naturalization includes a language proficiency requirement from the 8th Schedule. Renouncing foreign citizenship is a necessary step in the process of obtaining Indian citizenship.  The CAA, 2019, provides exemptions from penalties for certain categories of migrants.  The OCI scheme allows for the cancellation of OCI registration under specific circumstances. Finally, Foreigners Tribunals are indeed established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964.  Each statement accurately reflects a provision or feature of the respective type of citizenship or related Act.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheduled Areas/Provisions           Feature/Characteristic
1.  Fifth Schedule                       :  Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)
2. Sixth Schedule                        :  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
3. Special Category States (SCS)       :  Grants based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (Historically)
4. Special Financial Packages           : Discretionary grants under Article 282
5. PESA Act, 1996                       : Applicable to Fifth Schedule areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the characteristics of the mentioned scheduled areas or provisions. The Fifth Schedule is associated with Tribes Advisory Councils, while the Sixth Schedule deals with Autonomous District Councils and Autonomous Regional Councils.  Special Category States historically received funding based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Special financial packages are indeed discretionary grants allowed under Article 282 of the Constitution.  And the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), is specifically applicable to the Fifth Schedule areas. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct choice.  There is no inaccuracy or potential for misinterpretation in any pairing.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                     Specific Detail
1.  Statutory Backing                         :  Article 244(2) of the Constitution
2.  Seat of Gram Nyayalayas                 :  Headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat
3.  Jurisdiction                             :  Limited to civil disputes only
4.  Appeal Process                           : Appeals lie directly to the Supreme Court
5.  Dispute Resolution Mechanism           :  Strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, provides the statutory backing for the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas, not Article 244(2) which deals with the Sixth Schedule areas.  The Act's provisions clearly state that Gram Nyayalayas are located at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat.  Option 3 is incorrect; Gram Nyayalayas handle both civil and criminal cases, settling petty disputes at the village level. Option 4 is also incorrect; appeals in criminal cases go to the Court of Session, and in civil cases to the district court. Finally, Option 5 is incorrect because Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the strict rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but rather by principles of natural justice. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct legal provisions.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Contempt                       Specific Example
1.  Civil Contempt                         :  Publicly criticizing a judge's personal life
2.  Criminal Contempt                      :  Willful disobedience of a court order
3.  Civil Contempt                         :  Publishing an article that prejudices a pending case
4.  Criminal Contempt                      :  Refusal to comply with a court summons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize the court, prejudice judicial proceedings, or obstruct justice.  Option 1 is incorrect because publicly criticizing a judge's personal life is more aligned with criminal contempt, as it undermines the authority of the court. Option 2 is correctly matched as willful disobedience is a clear example of civil contempt. Option 3 is correctly matched as publishing an article that prejudices a pending case is criminal contempt. Option 4 is correctly matched as refusal to comply with a court summons is civil contempt. Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, showcasing understanding of the distinct nature of civil and criminal contempt.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                  Specific Detail
1.  Eligible Religious Groups               :  Includes Muslims
2.  Cut-off Date for Entry into India       :  December 31, 2014
3.  Exempted Areas                          :  Includes all of Arunachal Pradesh
4.  Naturalization Period Reduction         :  From 11 years to 5 years for specified migrants
5.  Legal Status of Exempted Migrants      :  Treated as illegal immigrants under the Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CAA, 2019, specifically excludes Muslims from its purview. The cut-off date for entry into India for the benefit of the Act is indeed December 31, 2014.  The Act exempts certain tribal areas and areas under Inner Line Permits, but not all of Arunachal Pradesh.  The naturalization period was reduced from 11 years to 5 years for the specified categories of migrants. The Act explicitly exempts the specified migrants from adverse consequences under other relevant Acts, meaning they are not treated as illegal immigrants. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched, demonstrating understanding of the CAA's specific provisions and their implications.


**4. With reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Eligibility Criterion                           Specific Document Required
1.  Person of Indian Origin                      :  Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) card
2.  Married to an Indian Citizen                  :  Marriage certificate
3.  Minor child of an Indian Citizen               :  Birth certificate of the child
4.  Person whose parents are registered as Indian citizens: Aadhaar Card of parents
5.  Proof of Renouncing Foreign Citizenship     :  Affidavit verifying statements


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, outline various eligibility criteria for citizenship by registration/naturalization.  An OCI card is acceptable proof of being a person of Indian origin. A marriage certificate is required for those married to an Indian citizen. A birth certificate serves as proof for a minor child of an Indian citizen.  While Aadhaar cards might be presented as evidence, they are not explicitly mandated as the sole requirement for proving that parents are registered Indian citizens. An affidavit is used to verify the correctness of statements but isn't solely for renouncing foreign citizenship; other documentation is also needed. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, reflecting an understanding of the documentation requirements under the amended rules.


**5. With reference to the Foreigners Tribunals, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                       Specific Detail
1.  Legal Basis                                 :  Foreigners Act, 1946
2.  Powers                                      :  Similar to a District Judge
3.  Establishment                             :  By State Governments
4.  Decision on Citizenship Status             :  Final and binding on all courts
5.  Exclusive Power to Declare Foreigner Status:  Yes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Foreigners Tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946. They possess powers similar to those of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, not the powers of a District Judge.  They are established by the Central Government, not state governments. Their decisions are not final and binding; appeals can be made to higher courts.  Crucially, only Foreigners Tribunals have the power to declare someone a foreigner. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched. This question tests understanding of the Tribunal's legal framework and its specific functions within the larger context of Indian citizenship law.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Specific Detail
1.  Central Information Commission (CIC) Members Appointment:  By the President based on the recommendation of the Prime Minister
2.  Applicability                               :  Includes only Central Government bodies
3.  Exemptions                                  :  Information concerning national security is always exempt
4.  Obligations of Public Authorities          :  Proactive disclosure of certain information
5.  Information Requestor                       :  Only Indian citizens can file RTI requests


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) All five



**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CIC members' appointments are indeed made by the President based on a committee's recommendation. The RTI Act's applicability extends beyond central government bodies to include various other public authorities. While information concerning national security can be exempt, the decision is case-specific and not always absolute.  The Act mandates proactive disclosure of information by public authorities to minimize the need for requests. The RTI Act allows any person to file a request, not just Indian citizens.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched. The question tests factual knowledge of the RTI Act and its application.


**7.  With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Sentence                                Specific Condition
1.  Pardon                                      :  Can only be granted for offenses against state laws
2.  Reprieve                                    :  Temporary postponement of execution
3.  Commutation                                 :  Reduction of death sentence to life imprisonment
4.  Remission                                   :  Complete cancellation of the sentence
5.  Suspension                                  :  Temporary halt to the sentence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions, and commutations of sentences.  A pardon is not limited to offenses against state laws; it can be granted for offenses under Union laws as well. Reprieve involves a temporary postponement of execution. Commutation refers to the reduction of a sentence (like death to life imprisonment). Remission involves the cancellation of a sentence. Suspension is a temporary halt to the sentence. Thus, options 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, demonstrating an understanding of the President's powers and the nuances of different types of clemency.


**8. With reference to the  Parliamentary Committees, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                     Specific Feature
1.  Public Accounts Committee                   :  Consists of members from Lok Sabha only
2.  Estimates Committee                         :  Examines the government's revenue collection
3.  Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages:  Established under the Official Languages Act, 1963
4.  Public Accounts Committee                   :  Audits the government's expenditure
5.  Estimates Committee                         :  Consists of 30 members from Lok Sabha


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee includes members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The Estimates Committee does not examine revenue collection; that is the domain of the Public Accounts Committee.  The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages was indeed established under the Official Languages Act, 1963. The Public Accounts Committee audits the government's expenditure. The Estimates Committee does indeed consist of 30 members from the Lok Sabha. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched, showing an understanding of the functions and composition of different parliamentary committees.


**9. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                         Specific Detail
1.  First Introduction                          :  During the 1960s Lok Sabha elections
2.  Governing Body                              :  The Election Commission of India (ECI)
3.  Applicability                               :  Only applies to national elections
4.  Nature                                      :  A legally binding set of rules
5.  Purpose                                      :  To ensure free and fair elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five



**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during Kerala State Assembly elections, not Lok Sabha elections. The ECI is indeed the governing body responsible for the MCC.  The MCC applies to both national and state elections.  The MCC is a set of guidelines, not a legally binding set of rules; violations can lead to action but are not directly punishable under law.  The MCC's purpose is indeed to ensure free and fair elections. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched.  The question assesses understanding of the MCC's origins, nature, and application.


**10. With reference to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Specific Detail
1.  Legal Basis                                :  Article 244(3)
2.  Governing Bodies                           :  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) only
3.  Powers of ADCs and ARCs                   :  Include taxation powers
4.  Number of ADCs currently in existence     :  10
5.  Applicability                               :  Limited to states in Northeast India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule is based on Article 244(2), not Article 244(3).  The Sixth Schedule includes both Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs). ADCs and ARCs do indeed have taxation powers. There are currently 10 ADCs in four states.  The Sixth Schedule applies to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and its application.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article          Provision Related To
1. Article 270                       :   Taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between Union and States
2. Article 275                       :   Grants-in-Aid provided by the Centre to States
3. Article 280                       :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
4. Article 292                       :   Union Government's power to borrow money within or outside the country
5. Article 293                       :   State Government's power to borrow money within India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States. Article 275 mandates the provision of grants-in-aid by the Centre to States. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission to adjudicate the sharing of resources. Article 292 grants the Union Government the power to borrow money both domestically and internationally.  Article 293 allows State Governments to borrow within India, but not abroad, and requires prior Union consent if the state is already indebted to the Union.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Parameter                  Value (as of a Specific Point in Time)
1.  Share of States from divisible pool  :  59%
2.  States' revenue expenditure from their revenue sources : 41%
3.  Debt-GDP ratio of states           :  25%
4.  Percentage of Centre's budget expenditure constituted by CSSs : 12.4%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The provided text states that states' finance only 58% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources.  The other figures provided as options are incorrect.  The share of states from the divisible pool is 41%, not 59%.  The debt-GDP ratio of states was 27.5% (not 25%), and the CSSs constitute around 10.4% (not 12.4%) of the Centre's budget expenditure. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Year                                   Event Related to Special Category Status
1. 1969                                  :  Abolition of Special Category Status
2. 1969                                  :  Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland granted SCS
3. 2017                                  :  SCS ceased to exist due to 14th FC recommendations
4. 2024                                  :  Bihar and Andhra Pradesh demand SCS

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. In 1969, Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted Special Category Status (SCS). The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the cessation of SCS in 2017.  Recently, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded special financial packages, reflecting a continued interest in addressing the developmental challenges previously addressed through SCS.  Pair 1 is incorrect; 1969 was the year SCS was *introduced*, not abolished. Therefore, option (d) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                   Key Feature/Objective
1. Mission Karmayogi                 :  Focuses solely on training contractual employees
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                :  Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans for 2025-26
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) :  Funding exclusively routed through the Consolidated Fund of India
4.  Sixth Schedule                    :  Inclusion of Ladakh as a recent development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan is indeed focused on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans for 2025-26.  The other pairs are inaccurate. Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, not just contractual employees. CSS funding is routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not India. While there's a demand for Ladakh's inclusion in the Sixth Schedule, it isn't a completed action. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                    Key Aspect
1. Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 :  Allows for changes in the religious character of places of worship post-1947
2. Aadhaar Act, 2016                  :  Makes Aadhaar mandatory for all services
3.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC)        :  Has statutory backing for enforcement of violations
4.  The Data Protection Act             :  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the High Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The Places of Worship Act, 1991, maintains the status quo of religious character as of 1947, preventing changes. Aadhaar is not mandatory for all services. The MCC lacks statutory backing for enforcement. Appeals against the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the High Court.  Therefore, the correct answer is (a).


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article          Subject Matter
1. Article 270                     :   Distribution of net proceeds of taxes between Union and States
2. Article 275                     :   Grants-in-aid to states
3. Article 280                     :   Appointment of the Governor
4. Article 292                     :   Union government's borrowing powers within India only
5. Article 293                     :   State government's borrowing powers within and outside India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  Article 275 mandates that the Union shall provide grants-in-aid to the states.  Article 280 pertains to the establishment of the Finance Commission. Article 292 explicitly grants the Union government the power to borrow money within India.  Article 293 allows state governments to borrow money within India, but not outside.  Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, particularly concerning Articles 280, 292, and 293, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of these articles' specific provisions. Option (c) accurately reflects the subject matter of Articles 270, 275, and 293.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Provision           Description
1. Vertical Devolution             :   Distribution of funds among states based on criteria like income distance
2. Horizontal Devolution          :   Share of states from divisible pool of taxes
3. Grants-in-Aid                  :   Provided by the Union to states under Article 275
4. Special Packages               :   Discretionary financial assistance to states under Article 282
5.  Borrowings by States           :  Require prior consent of the Union if indebted to it

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes, while horizontal devolution involves distribution among states based on various criteria.  Grants-in-aid are indeed provided under Article 275. Special packages are discretionary grants under Article 282.  States indebted to the Union require prior consent for further borrowing.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly pair vertical and horizontal devolution, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the concepts. Option (c) correctly matches the descriptions with their corresponding financial provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                 Key Feature
1. Mission Karmayogi                :   Focuses on role-based training for civil servants
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan               :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)
3. AuditOnline application           :   Online audit of panchayat accounts
4.  Special Category Status (SCS)  :   Grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (historical context)
5.  Sixth Schedule                   :   Inclusion of Ladakh as a recent development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All five pairs


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi indeed shifts towards role-based training. Jan Yojana Abhiyan is correctly linked to PDP preparation. AuditOnline facilitates online audits of panchayat accounts.  Historically, SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  The inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule is a matter of ongoing discussion and debate, not a confirmed development.  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the pairing related to the Sixth Schedule, showing a lack of precise knowledge on the current status of this constitutional provision. Option (b) accurately reflects the key features of the schemes and initiatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment/Institution         Provision/Function
1. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts :   Local self-governance provisions
2.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)      :    Part of Mission Karmayogi
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL)  : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies
4.  Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991 :  Maintains the religious character of places of worship as of August 15, 1947
5.  Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council       :   Established under Article 279A

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts introduced provisions for local self-governance. The CBC is indeed part of Mission Karmayogi. iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance. The Places of Worship Act maintains the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947. The GST Council is established under Article 279A. All pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b) and (d) demonstrate incomplete knowledge of the functions and provisions related to these different acts, amendments and institutions.  Option (c) correctly pairs all five entries.


**1. With reference to the Indian Passport system, consider the following pairs:**

   Passport Type                     Color
1. Ordinary Passport                 :   White
2. Diplomatic Passport              :   Maroon
3. Official Passport                 :   Blue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text clearly states that there are three classes of passports issued in India: Ordinary (blue colour), Diplomatic (white colour), and Official (maroon colour).  Therefore, none of the pairs in the question are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate passport types with the wrong colors. The question tests factual recall regarding the color-coding of different passport types in India.  Understanding the different types of passports and their designated colors is important for comprehending the nuances of Indian citizenship and international travel regulations.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of passport types and their associated colors, forcing them to recall the accurate information provided in the text rather than relying on assumptions. The incorrect options present plausible but ultimately false pairings, highlighting the importance of precise factual recall in answering such questions.


**2. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of CSC Scheme                  Detail
1.  Governing Body                     :  Ministry of Electronics and IT
2.  Legal Framework                    :  Companies Act, 2013
3.  Primary Goal                         :  Providing services to urban citizens

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme, was set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956. This makes option 1 correct. Option 2 is incorrect as the act mentioned is 1956 not 2013. Option 3 is incorrect because CSCs primarily serve rural citizens, not urban citizens. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the CSC scheme's organizational structure, legal basis, and target beneficiaries. The distractors aim to confuse candidates by presenting plausible but inaccurate details about the scheme's legal framework and target population.  The question highlights the need for precise knowledge of the scheme's details, including its legal foundation and the population it serves.  Correctly answering this question demonstrates an understanding of the scheme's implementation and reach.


**3. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of WPFI 2024                      Detail
1.  Ranking of India                      :   160 out of 180 countries
2.  Publishing Organization                :   Reporters Without Borders (RSF)
3.  Index Release Frequency              :   Biennially

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that India ranked 159 among 180 countries in the WPFI 2024, and that the index is released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Pair 1 is incorrect as the rank is mentioned as 159, not 160. Pair 3 is incorrect because the index is released annually, not biennially. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the WPFI, its publisher, and India's ranking. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect rankings and release frequencies serves as effective distractors, emphasizing the importance of precise information recall.  A correct response indicates a thorough understanding of the WPFI's significance and its implications for press freedom globally.


**4. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision               Subject Matter
1.  Article 270                          :   Levy and Collection of GST
2.  Article 280                          :   Establishment of Finance Commission
3.  Article 293                          :   Union Government borrowing powers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage correctly identifies Article 280 as the constitutional provision establishing the Finance Commission.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of revenue between the Union and States, not the levy and collection of GST (that's Article 269-A).  Article 293 deals with state government borrowing powers, not the Union government.  Therefore, only option (b) is correct.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the constitutional framework governing fiscal relations between the Union and States in India. The incorrect options include provisions related to revenue distribution and borrowing, but they are incorrectly paired with the described subject matters, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related constitutional provisions.


**5.  With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                      Status
1.  Andhra Pradesh                         :   Granted SCS in 1969
2.  Jammu & Kashmir                       :   Granted SCS in 1969
3.  Sikkim                                  :   Currently holds SCS status

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted SCS in 1969.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.  Andhra Pradesh was not granted SCS in 1969, nor does it currently hold this status as per the passage.  Sikkim was granted SCS later; however, as the passage indicates that SCS ceased to exist following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations,  pair 3 is incorrect. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the historical context and the current status of SCS in India.  The distractors include states that have been associated with demands for SCS or have received special financial packages, but are incorrectly matched with the specific status and timeline. This highlights the importance of precise knowledge of the historical evolution and the current status of SCS in India.


**6. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of CSS                           Detail
1.  Funding Mechanism                     :   100% Central Funding for all schemes
2.  Primary Mode of Transfer (post 2017) :   Central Sector Schemes
3.  Monitoring Authority                   :   Exclusively the Ministry of Finance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The passage also clarifies that following the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs and Central Sector schemes became the primary mode of specific purpose transfers; however, the statement that CSSs are the *only* primary mode of transfer is an oversimplification and therefore pair 2 is incorrect.  Finally, the passage states NITI Aayog has concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSSs, not solely the Ministry of Finance, making pair 3 incorrect. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the funding, implementation, and monitoring mechanisms of CSSs. The distractors present plausible but ultimately inaccurate details about the funding pattern, the primary mode of transfer, and the monitoring authority, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the CSS framework.


**7. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Mission Karmayogi           Detail
1.  Implementing Body                    :   Capacity Building Commission (CBC)
2.  Target Beneficiaries                 :   All civil servants (excluding contractual employees)
3.  Key Principle                         :   Shift from role-based to rule-based training

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The passage clearly states that the Capacity Building Commission (CBC) launched Mission Karmayogi as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB). Thus, pair 1 is correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrect as the passage specifies that the program covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees.  Pair 3 is also incorrect; the passage highlights a shift from *rule*-based to *role*-based training. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of Mission Karmayogi's implementing body, target beneficiaries, and guiding principles. The distractors present plausible but inaccurate details about the target group and the core principles of the program, emphasizing the importance of precise understanding of the initiative's scope and objectives.


**8. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of Aadhaar                       Detail
1.  Data Storage                          :   Decentralized storage of resident data
2.  Proof of Identity                      :   Proof of citizenship and domicile
3.  Mandatoriness for Services           :   Mandatory for all services, including private sector services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly mentions that Aadhaar data is stored *centrally*, not decentralized, making pair 1 incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of address and identity but *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile, making pair 2 incorrect.  The passage also states that Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but not for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections, making pair 3 incorrect.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of Aadhaar's technical architecture, its legal status as proof of identity, and its mandatory use for accessing services. The incorrect options present plausible but factually inaccurate details about data storage, legal status, and mandatory usage, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of Aadhaar's features and limitations.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                   Status under Sixth Schedule
1.  Arunachal Pradesh                      :   Fully included
2.  Sikkim                                 :   Partially included
3.  Ladakh                                :   Currently included

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage indicates that Arunachal Pradesh is entirely located within protected areas under the Sixth Schedule.  Parts of Sikkim are also under the Sixth Schedule, while the rest are in a restricted area.  The passage does not mention Ladakh's inclusion in the Sixth Schedule.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the geographical scope and application of the Sixth Schedule provisions. The distractors present states that have features related to the Sixth Schedule but are not accurately matched with their status, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the geographical distribution of the Sixth Schedule's application.


**10. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of the Act                         Detail
1.  Replaced Acts                           :   Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 only
2.  Spectrum Allocation                    :   Primarily through auction, with some administrative allocation
3.  Regulation of OTT Platforms             :   Regulated under the Telecommunications Act, 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the Telecommunications Act, 2023 repeals both the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The passage correctly describes spectrum allocation as being primarily through auction with some administrative allocation for specified purposes.  Therefore, pair 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that OTT platforms are *not* regulated under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, making pair 3 incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the key provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023, including the acts it replaces, its approach to spectrum allocation, and its stance on regulating OTT platforms.  The distractors present plausible but ultimately inaccurate details about the replaced acts and the regulation of OTT platforms, emphasizing the need for precise and comprehensive understanding of the Act's provisions.


**11. With reference to the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Provision                          Permissibility of Sub-Classification
1.  Article 341(1)                         :   Prohibits sub-classification
2.  Article 341(2)                         :   Permits sub-classification
3.  Indra Sawhney Judgment                 :   Sets a 50% upper ceiling for reservations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the Supreme Court's decision in *State of Punjab & Others v Davinder Singh & Others* held that sub-classification within Scheduled Castes is permissible.  While Article 341(1) specifies SCs, it doesn't prohibit sub-classification. Article 341(2) allows Parliament to modify the list of SCs, which implicitly permits sub-classification.  The Indra Sawhney judgment indeed sets a 50% upper ceiling for reservations.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the legal framework and judicial pronouncements concerning sub-classification of Scheduled Castes.  The distractors include legal provisions that are related to the topic but are incorrectly linked to the permissibility of sub-classification, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of legal provisions and judicial interpretations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                  Characteristic
1. Public Accounts Committee                 :   Examines CAG audit reports on appropriation accounts
2. Committee on Public Undertakings          :   Reviews the performance of public sector undertakings
3. Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha)    :   Consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman
4. Estimates Committee                       :   Consists of 30 members from Lok Sabha only
5. Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages:  Submits recommendations to the President on Hindi usage


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) scrutinizes the Comptroller and Auditor General of India's (CAG) audit reports, including those on appropriation accounts.  The Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) examines the working of public sector undertakings.  The Estimates Committee consists of 30 members, all from the Lok Sabha. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha has 10 members, nominated by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not 15. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) indeed submits its recommendations regarding the use of Hindi for official purposes to the President. Therefore, pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                       Composition/Characteristic
1. Lokpal                                     :   Headed by a former Chief Justice of India
2. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) :   Appointed by the President based on a committee's recommendation
3. Cabinet Committee                          :   Extra-constitutional in nature
4. Collegium System                           :   Headed by the Chief Justice of India
5. Delimitation Commission                    :   Decisions are considered final and unchallengeable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Lokpal can be headed by a person who is or has been a Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court, not necessarily a former CJI. The NHRC's Chairperson and members are appointed by the President based on the recommendations of a committee. Cabinet Committees are indeed extra-constitutional bodies. The Collegium System for judicial appointments is headed by the Chief Justice of India.  The Delimitation Commission's decisions are final and not challengeable in court.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution                                  Power/Function
1.  Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)     :   Governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946
2.  State Election Commission (SEC)           :   Delimits constituencies for local body elections
3.  Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT)     :   Appeals against its orders lie only with the Supreme Court
4.  Election Commission of India (ECI)        :   Model Code of Conduct has statutory backing
5.  Parliamentary Committees                  :   Draw authority from Articles 105 and 118


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CBI is indeed governed by the DSPE Act, 1946.  The SEC is responsible for delimiting constituencies for local body elections. Parliamentary Committees derive their authority from Articles 105 and 118.  However, appeals from the CAT generally lie with the High Courts, not exclusively the Supreme Court. The Model Code of Conduct of the ECI does not have statutory backing. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                      Provision
1. Article 15                                 :   Abolishes untouchability
2. Article 17                                 :   Prohibits discrimination based on religion, race, caste, sex, or place of birth
3. Article 323A                               :   Relates to the establishment of administrative tribunals
4. Article 86                                 :   Deals with the President's address to Parliament
5. Article 324                                :   Provides for the superintendence, direction, and control of elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 15 prohibits discrimination, while Article 17 abolishes untouchability. Article 323A deals with administrative tribunals; Article 86 relates to the President addressing Parliament; and Article 324 concerns the Election Commission's powers.  Therefore, only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                     Key Feature
1. Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013            :   Established Lokayuktas at the state level
2. Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993       :   Defines human rights as relating to life, liberty, equality, and dignity
3. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996     :   Allows for unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards in cases of fraud
4. Official Languages Act, 1963               :   Envisaged the adoption of Hindi for official purposes
5. Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961:  Provide for the establishment of Cabinet Committees


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013, established the Lokpal at the central level and provided for the establishment of Lokayuktas at the state level, although the structure isn't uniform across states. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, defines human rights as mentioned. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, was amended in 2021 to allow for stays in cases of fraud or corruption. The Official Languages Act, 1963, indeed envisioned the adoption of Hindi. The Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, provide for the establishment of Cabinet Committees.  Therefore, pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Pair 1 is partially correct, but the focus is on the central Lokpal. Pair 3 is correct regarding the amendment but doesn't fully capture the Act's core function.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article              Provision Related To
1. Article 270                        :   Distribution of taxes between Union and States
2. Article 275                         :   Grants-in-Aid to States
3. Article 280                         :   Establishment of Finance Commission
4. Article 292                         :   Union Government's borrowing powers within India only
5. Article 293                         :   State Government's borrowing powers within and outside India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  Article 275 mandates the Union to provide grants-in-aid to states from the consolidated fund of India.  Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of net proceeds of taxes and grants-in-aid. Article 292 empowers the Union government to borrow money within India, while Article 293 allows state governments to borrow only within India, not internationally.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include Article 292 or Article 293 or both, misrepresenting their provisions concerning borrowing powers.  Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the correct matching of the constitutional articles with their respective provisions.


**2. With reference to the 15th Finance Commission, consider the following pairs:**

    Criterion for Horizontal Devolution       Weight Assigned (%)
1. Income Distance                        :   2.5
2. Area                                   :   15
3. Population (2011)                     :   12.5
4. Demographic Performance                :   45
5. Forest and Ecology                     :   10

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 15th Finance Commission used several criteria for horizontal devolution among states.  Area was assigned a weight of 15%, Population (2011) 15%, and Forest and Ecology 10%.  Option (a) is partially correct but omits the correct matching of Population (2011). Option (c) incorrectly assigns the weight of Income Distance. Option (d) is entirely incorrect as it misrepresents the weights assigned to several criteria.  Only option (b) correctly matches two out of the three pairs, making it the most appropriate answer.  The remaining criteria, Income Distance and Demographic Performance, had different weights than those presented in the distractor options.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    State Granted Special Category Status (SCS) in 1969     Year of Grant
1. Jammu & Kashmir                           :   1971
2. Assam                                      :   1969
3. Nagaland                                   :   1975
4. Sikkim                                     :   1975

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Special Category Status (SCS) was initially granted to Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland in 1969.  Sikkim was granted SCS later.  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect years for the grant of SCS to at least one state.  Option (a) correctly identifies only Assam as receiving SCS in 1969, making it the only accurate match. The other options incorporate years that are close to the actual years or are entirely incorrect, highlighting the need for precise factual recall.  The question tests factual recall of specific events related to the grant of SCS.


**4. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Cantonment Board Feature              Detail
1. First Cantonment Established           :   Secunderabad
2. Number of Cantonments post-independence :   6
3. Administering Act                     :   Cantonments Act, 2006
4. Administrative Control                 :   Ministry of Home Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Barrackpore (Calcutta) was the first cantonment established in 1765. Six cantonments were established after Indian independence. The Cantonments Act, 2006 governs the administration of cantonments. The Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, holds administrative control over Cantonment Boards. Options (b), (c), and (d)  contain inaccuracies regarding the first cantonment, the number of post-independence cantonments, or the administrative control. Only option (a) accurately identifies the correct matches. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific facts related to the history and administration of Cantonment Boards in India.


**5. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following pairs:**

    Article                                  Right Guaranteed
1. Article 14                              :   Right to Life
2. Article 21                              :   Right to Equality
3. Article 19                              :   Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 14 guarantees the right to equality, Article 21 guarantees the right to life, and Article 19 guarantees the right to freedom of speech and expression.  Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 21.  Only option (b) correctly pairs Article 19 with its associated right. The Supreme Court's judgment regarding climate change and the right to life highlights the evolving interpretation of fundamental rights in the context of environmental concerns. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the fundamental rights enshrined in the Indian Constitution and their application in contemporary issues.



**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Provision                                   Feature
    1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                 :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim
    2. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                  :   Applies to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings
    3.  Court of Judicial Magistrate of First Class :   Status of Gram Nyayalayas
    4.  High Court                               :   Appoints Nyayadhikari in consultation with State Govt.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes Gram Nyayalayas and explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be Courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class, possessing both civil and criminal jurisdiction. The appointment of Nyayadhikari involves consultation between the State government and the High Court.  Crucially, Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; they operate under principles of natural justice. This makes option (a) the only entirely correct combination. Option (b) incorrectly includes the High Court's role in appointing Nyayadhikari; while the High Court is consulted, the State government makes the appointment. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly links the Indian Evidence Act to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the mismatched pair concerning the Evidence Act.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Contempt                         Description
    1. Civil Contempt                         :   Publication of matter scandalizing a court
    2. Criminal Contempt                      :   Willful disobedience of a court order
    3. Article 129 of the Constitution of India :   Grants power to High Courts to punish contempt
    4. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971           : Defines contempt of court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions like publishing material that scandalizes or interferes with the court's authority.  Article 129 grants the Supreme Court, not High Courts, the power to punish contempt; Article 215 extends this power to High Courts. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework defining contempt.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) incorrectly attributes the definition of civil contempt to the wrong category and incorrectly links Article 129 to High Courts. Option (c) is partially correct, but omits the correct pairing of criminal contempt and its description. Option (d) is incorrect due to the mismatched pair involving Article 129.


**3. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Jan Yojana Abhiyan             Detail
    1. Aim                                   :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans for 2025-26
    2. Launch Year                              :   2018
    3. Key Implementing Body                 :   Ministry of Rural Development
    4.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI)    :   Used to assess the holistic development of panchayats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  It was launched in 2018 under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The PDI is a crucial tool used to assess the progress of panchayats.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct pairing of the PDI with its function. Option (c) is partially correct, but excludes the correct launch year. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect implementing body.


**4. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Cantonment Boards              Detail
    1. Administrative Control                 :   Ministry of Home Affairs
    2. Legal Framework                        :   Cantonments Act, 2006
    3. First Cantonment established            :   Barrackpore in 1765
    4. Number of Cantonments in India (approx.):   61


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and Barrackpore was the first cantonment, established in 1765. There are approximately 61 cantonments in India.  However, the administrative control of Cantonment Boards rests with the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (b) is partially correct, but incorrectly assigns the administrative control to the Ministry of Home Affairs. Option (c) is partially correct, but omits the correct legal framework and the first cantonment established. Option (d) is incorrect because of the mismatched pair related to the administrative control.


**5. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of iCAL                                 Detail
    1. Location                                     :   Rajkot, Gujarat
    2. Primary Aim                                  :   Setting global standards for auditing local governance
    3. Funding Source                               :   Ministry of Finance
    4.  Type of Organization                       :   Collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, and aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  It serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors. The funding source for iCAL is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, and therefore cannot be definitively stated as the Ministry of Finance.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct description of iCAL as a collaborative platform. Option (c) is partially correct but omits the location. Option (d) is incorrect due to the uncertain funding source.


**6. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature of the Sixth Schedule                  Detail
    1.  Enabling Act                              :   Article 244(2)
    2.  Bodies Established                       :   Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
    3.  Number of ADCs (approximately)          :   10
    4.  Applicability                             :   Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs in specific states. There are approximately 10 ADCs currently operational. The Sixth Schedule applies to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. All the pairs are correctly matched, making (a) the correct answer.  There are no incorrect pairings in this option.  The other options omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**7. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of State Formation                     Detail
    1.  Constitutional Provision                  :   Article 3
    2.  Requirement for a Bill                     :   President's recommendation
    3.  Final Authority for State Formation       :   State Legislative Assemblies
    4.  Process Involves                          :   Parliamentary Law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Indian Constitution outlines the process for forming new states or altering existing ones.  A bill for state formation requires the President's recommendation, and the process involves the enactment of a parliamentary law. However, the final authority for state formation rests with the Parliament, not the State Legislative Assemblies. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) omits the correct procedural involvement of Parliament. Option (c) is incorrect as it assigns the final authority incorrectly. Option (d) is incorrect because of the mismatched pair regarding the final authority.


**8. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Fiscal Federalism                Detail
    1.  Constitutional Basis                    :   Seventh Schedule
    2.  Vertical Devolution                     :   Distribution among states from their allocated share
    3.  Horizontal Devolution                   :   Share of states from divisible pool
    4.  Article 275                             :   Grants-in-aid


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution delineates the tax bases between the Union and States, forming the basis of fiscal federalism. Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to States. Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes, while horizontal devolution is the distribution among states from their allocated share.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (b) incorrectly defines horizontal and vertical devolution. Option (c) also incorrectly defines these terms. Option (d) is incorrect because of the mismatched pairs related to devolution.


**9. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of Special Category Status          Detail
    1.  First Introduction Year                  :   1969
    2.  Basis for Granting                       :   Geographical and socio-economic disadvantages
    3.  Constitutional Provision                 :   Article 370
    4.  Funding Formula (Historically)           :   Gadgil-Mukherjee formula


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, considering geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  Historically, funding was based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  However, there is no specific constitutional provision for SCS; it is a policy decision. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is partially correct, but omits the historical funding formula. Option (c) is partially correct but omits the introduction year. Option (d) is incorrect due to the incorrect constitutional provision.


**10. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), consider the following pairs:**

    ADR Mechanism                                  Governing Act/Framework
    1.  Arbitration                                 :   Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
    2.  Mediation                                  :   Online Mediation Training Web-Portal
    3.  International Commercial Arbitration     :   UNCITRAL Model Law
    4.  International Commercial Mediation       :   UNCITRAL Model Law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs domestic arbitration. The UNCITRAL Model Law underpins both international commercial arbitration and mediation.  The Online Mediation Training Web-Portal is a facilitation tool, not a governing act. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) incorrectly includes the Online Mediation Training Web-Portal as a governing act. Option (b) omits the correct pairing of international commercial arbitration with the UNCITRAL Model Law. Option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of mediation with the web-portal.



**1. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature
1. CSS Funding Pattern for Core Schemes in 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States : Centre:State = 50:50
2. CSS Funding Pattern for Core Schemes in Other States                              : Centre:State = 70:30
3.  Body having concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSSs                             : Ministry of Finance
4.  Year in which Plan-Non Plan distinction was abolished                             : 2018
5.  Approximate percentage of Centre’s budget expenditure constituted by CSSs        : 20.4%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The funding pattern for core CSSs in 8 Northeastern states and 3 Himalayan states is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 50:50.  This highlights the central government's increased financial commitment to these regions due to their unique developmental challenges.

2. **Incorrect:** The funding pattern for core CSSs in other states is 60:40 (Centre:State), not 70:30. This reflects a balance of funding responsibility between the central and state governments.

3. **Incorrect:** NITI Aayog, not the Ministry of Finance, has concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSSs. This reflects the NITI Aayog's role in coordinating and overseeing national development programs.

4. **Incorrect:** The Plan-Non Plan distinction in the Indian budget was abolished in 2017, not 2018.  This was a significant budgetary reform aimed at simplifying the budgeting process and improving resource allocation efficiency.

5. **Incorrect:** Centrally Sponsored Schemes constitute approximately 10.4% of the Centre’s budget expenditure, not 20.4%. This indicates the substantial but not overwhelming share of CSSs in the overall central budget.


The incorrect information in each pair underscores the importance of understanding the precise details of government schemes and budgetary allocations.  A superficial understanding can lead to inaccurate conclusions.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall and accurately match specific details related to CSS, a crucial component of India's federal financial architecture.




**2. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                     Detail
1. Year of Launch                               : 2024
2.  Primary Goal                                  : To improve the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) scores across all states
3.  Implementation Level                        :  Primarily at the Gram Panchayat level
4.  Key Stakeholders involved                  :  Only elected representatives of Panchayats
5. Thematic approach of the campaign           : Based on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018, not 2024.  The question attempts to mislead by providing a recent year, testing the candidate's knowledge of the scheme's timeline.

2. **Incorrect:** While improving PDI scores is a desirable outcome, the primary goal is to accelerate people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs), not solely focusing on PDI improvement.  This highlights the participatory nature of the campaign.

3. **Correct:** The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is implemented at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District), but it significantly involves the Gram Panchayat level in the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).

4. **Incorrect:** The campaign actively involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs), and other stakeholders, not just elected representatives. This demonstrates the multi-stakeholder approach to participatory planning.

5. **Correct:** The thematic approach of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is indeed based on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring alignment with national and international development priorities.


The question tests the candidate's understanding of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's objectives, implementation strategy, and stakeholder involvement.  The inclusion of incorrect information in several pairs necessitates careful consideration and precise knowledge of the scheme's details.



**3. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                   Detail
1.  Location                                    :  New Delhi
2.  Primary Objective                          : To standardize auditing practices for all levels of government
3.  Funding Source                             : Primarily funded by the World Bank
4.  Key Function                               : Capacity building of local government auditors
5.  Type of Organization                       : A non-governmental organization


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not New Delhi. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the institution's geographical location.

2. **Incorrect:** While standardization is a goal, the primary objective is to set global standards specifically for auditing local governance bodies, not all levels of government.  The focus on local governance is crucial.

3. **Incorrect:** The passage does not specify the funding source of iCAL.  The inclusion of the World Bank as a potential funder serves as a plausible distractor.

4. **Correct:** Capacity building of local government auditors is a key function of iCAL, reflecting its role as a center of excellence.

5. **Incorrect:** iCAL's status as a collaborative platform suggests it's not strictly a non-governmental organization. Its exact organizational structure is not explicitly defined in the provided text, making this a valid distractor.

This question evaluates the candidate's ability to accurately recall and associate specific details with iCAL.  The inclusion of several incorrect pairs emphasizes the need for precise knowledge and careful attention to detail. The question also highlights the importance of understanding the specific focus and functions of institutions related to local governance.


**4.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                     Detail
1.  Launch Year                                : 2022
2.  Implementing Body                           :  Department of Personnel and Training
3.  Target Group                               : All civil servants, excluding contractual employees
4.  Key Principle                               :  Shift from rule-based to role-based training
5.  Primary Objective                          : To improve the efficiency of only the Indian Administrative Service


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:


1. **Incorrect:** Mission Karmayogi's capacity building initiative, NPCSCB, was launched in 2021, not 2022. The slight discrepancy in the year tests the candidate's attentiveness to detail.

2. **Correct:** The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), a key component of Mission Karmayogi, operates under the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT). This demonstrates the DoPT's role in civil service reform.

3. **Incorrect:**  Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various government entities. The exclusion of contractual employees is a misleading detail.

4. **Correct:** A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is the shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.  This reflects a modern approach to civil service training that emphasizes practical skills and competencies.

5. **Incorrect:** The primary objective is to create a professional, well-trained, and future-looking civil service across all levels, not limited to the IAS.  This broad objective is a crucial element of the mission.

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of Mission Karmayogi's scope, objectives, and key principles.  The inclusion of several incorrect pairs, particularly those with minor discrepancies, requires careful examination and precise knowledge of the subject.


**5. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                   Detail
1.  Data Storage Duration                     :  Indefinitely
2.  Proof of Citizenship                     : Yes
3.  Mandatory for Bank Accounts              : Yes
4.  Data Categories Captured                 : Caste, religion, income, health, geography
5.  Supreme Court Judgement on Constitutionality: Declared unconstitutional


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) None
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, not indefinitely. This highlights the importance of data privacy and security in the Aadhaar system.

2. **Incorrect:** Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship or domicile. This distinction is crucial for understanding the legal implications of Aadhaar.

3. **Incorrect:** The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be forced for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections, making it not mandatory in these contexts.  This decision protects individual rights.

4. **Incorrect:** Aadhaar's Random Number does not capture details like caste, religion, income, health, geography, etc.  This emphasizes the limited scope of data collected by Aadhaar.

5. **Incorrect:** The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, not declared it unconstitutional.  This highlights the legal basis of Aadhaar in India.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of Aadhaar's technical aspects, legal framework, and the Supreme Court's ruling.  The inclusion of completely incorrect information in all pairs necessitates a thorough understanding of the subject.  It underscores the need for accuracy in recalling key details surrounding Aadhaar's functionality and legal status.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Sixth Schedule is under Article 244(2), not Article 244(1). This tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific constitutional provision.

2. **Incorrect:** The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  This highlights the specific committee responsible for its formulation.

3. **Incorrect:** The Sixth Schedule covers specific areas within the Northeastern states, not the entire region. This demonstrates the targeted application of the Sixth Schedule.

4. **Correct:** The Sixth Schedule establishes Autonomous District Councils as a key administrative structure.  This is a crucial aspect of its governance mechanism.

5. **Incorrect:** While promoting the unique cultural and administrative needs of tribal areas is a purpose, promoting linguistic diversity is not the primary purpose. This highlights the specific focus of the Sixth Schedule.


This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the Sixth Schedule's constitutional basis, geographical scope, and administrative features. The inclusion of incorrect pairs emphasizes the importance of precise knowledge and understanding of the nuances of this specific constitutional provision.



**7. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail

3.  Funding Formula                            :  Based on the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations
4.  Current Status                             : Still granted to several states
5.  Criteria for Granting                      :  Geographical and socio-economic disadvantages


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Constitution does not include any provision for categorisation of any State in India as an SCS state. This highlights the non-constitutional basis of SCS.

2. **Incorrect:** SCS was first introduced in 1969, not 1979, based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the historical timeline.

3. **Incorrect:** SCS states used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, not the Sarkaria Commission's recommendations. This highlights the specific formula used for funding.

4. **Incorrect:** On the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, SCS ceased to exist; therefore, no SCS has been granted to any State since then. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the current status.

5. **Correct:** The criteria for granting SCS were indeed geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. This is the core rationale behind the concept of SCS.

This question tests the candidate's understanding of SCS's historical context, constitutional basis, and current status.

3.  Provision for FIR                             :  Only if there is a significant financial loss involved
4.  Scope                                         :  Covers only national-level examinations
5.  Committee Formation                         :  Mandatory for all instances of suspected unfair means


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) None
(d) 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **Incorrect:** The Union Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions notified the rules, not the Ministry of Education. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the relevant ministry.

2. **Incorrect:** The rules came into force from June 2024, not June 2023.  The slight discrepancy in the year tests the candidate's attention to detail.

3. **Incorrect:** The rules provide for the venue-in-charge to take appropriate action, including filing of an FIR, if a prima facie case of unfair means or offense is reported, regardless of financial loss.  This highlights the seriousness of the offense.

4. **Incorrect:** The rules apply to public examinations, encompassing a wide range of examinations, not just national-level ones. This underscores the broad scope of the rules.

5. **Incorrect:** A committee is formed only if there is involvement of the Management or Board of Directors of the service provider, not for all instances of suspected unfair means.  This highlights the specific circumstances requiring committee formation.

This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024. The inclusion of completely incorrect information in all pairs necessitates a thorough understanding of the subject matter.  It emphasizes the need for precision in recalling details and understanding the scope and application of the rules.


**1. With reference to the Panchayati Raj system, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                   Key Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                         :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26
2. People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)              :   Launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018
3. Panchayat Development Index (PDI)       :   Multi-domain index assessing panchayat development
4. e-Gram Swaraj portal                      :   Publication of approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs)
5. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC), is a crucial initiative of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj focused on preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  It was launched in 2018 under the name ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’. A key component of this process is the utilization of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI), a multi-sectoral index designed to assess the overall development of panchayats.  Finally, the approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal for transparency and accessibility. The recent inauguration of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) in Rajkot, Gujarat underscores the commitment to improving the auditing process of local governance bodies.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme                                      Characteristic
1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)        :   Funded jointly by the Centre and States
2.  CSSs                                      :   Implemented through States in sectors falling under State and Concurrent Lists
3.  CSSs Funding                             :   All transfers routed through Consolidated Fund of the State
4.  CSSs Funding Pattern (North Eastern States) :   Centre:State ratio of 90:10 for core schemes
5.  CSSs Monitoring                           :   NITI Aayog has concurrent jurisdiction

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. CSSs are indeed jointly funded by the central and state governments, implemented by states in sectors listed in the State and Concurrent lists of the Constitution.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to all CSS funding being channeled through the Consolidated Fund of the State. The funding pattern for core schemes in eight Northeastern and three Himalayan states is a 90:10 Centre:State ratio.  Finally, NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring these schemes, holding concurrent jurisdiction.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                      Description
1. Aadhaar Number                             :   A random number; does not capture details like caste, religion, etc.
2. Aadhaar                                    :   Proof of address and identity for residents of India
3. Aadhaar Data Storage                       :   Metadata cannot be stored for more than six months (as per 2018 SC judgment)
4. Aadhaar Act, 2016                           :   Affirms the constitutionality of Aadhaar (as per 2018 SC judgment)
5. Aadhaar Use                                :   Mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes; not for bank accounts or mobile connections

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs accurately reflect aspects of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on its constitutionality.  The Aadhaar number is indeed a random number, not revealing sensitive personal details.  It serves as proof of address and identity for Indian residents. The Supreme Court's ruling mandates that Aadhaar metadata cannot be retained beyond six months.  The 2018 judgment affirmed the Act's constitutionality.  Finally, the ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes, its use cannot be enforced for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**4. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Detail

2. Right of Way (RoW) framework             :   Granted on a non-discriminatory and non-exclusive basis
3. User Protection                             :   Measures include Do Not Disturb registers and reporting mechanisms
4. Digital Bharat Nidhi                        :   Replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF)
5. OTT Platform Regulation                   :   Not regulated under the Telecommunications Act 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, introduced significant changes in the telecom sector.  Spectrum allocation is primarily done through auctions, with certain exceptions for administrative allocation for specified purposes.  The Act establishes a non-discriminatory RoW framework.  It also incorporates user protection measures such as Do Not Disturb registers and mechanisms for reporting malware.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi has replaced the USOF.  Significantly, Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms are explicitly excluded from regulation under this Act. Hence, all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. With reference to  the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                     Provision

4. Article 280                               :   Provision for the Finance Commission
5. Article 282                               :   Power for discretionary grants by the Centre and States

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly link the articles of the Indian Constitution to their respective provisions. Article 72 deals with the President's pardoning power. Article 137 grants the Supreme Court the power to review its judgments. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission. Finally, Article 282 provides for discretionary grants.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.



**6. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) and Special Packages, consider the following pairs:**

4. Special Packages                         :   Additional grants under Article 282
5. Special Packages                         :   Purely discretionary support to states facing challenges


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe the characteristics of Special Category Status (SCS) and Special Packages.  SCS is indeed a classification for states facing specific disadvantages. It was introduced in 1969 following the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations, and SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Special Packages, on the other hand, are additional grants provided under Article 282 of the Constitution.  They are discretionary and aim to address the needs of states facing unique geographical or socioeconomic challenges.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and hence incorrect.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                     Description

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly identify features of the Sixth Schedule. It's located in Article 244(2) of the Constitution, stemming from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations.  The Sixth Schedule establishes Autonomous District Councils within the specified states, granting them significant autonomy over their affairs in order to protect the interests of tribal populations.  The Schedule applies to parts of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.

(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CSC SPV is responsible for implementing the CSC scheme, established by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956. CSCs form one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan.  They offer a wide range of services, including G2C (Government-to-Citizen), B2C (Business-to-Citizen), and financial services.  All pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are thus incomplete and incorrect.

One of its guiding principles is a shift from rule-based to role-based training. The mission covers all civil servants, including contractual employees. The CBC was indeed launched in 2021 as part of Mission Karmayogi. All pairs are accurately matched; therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.

The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the coordinating agency.  The Act is rooted in international human rights principles, notably those articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Freedom of Information Act, 2002, preceded the RTI Act, 2005.

Article 275 details the provision of grants-in-aid from the Union government to the States, often for specific developmental purposes.  Article 292 outlines the borrowing powers of the Union government, both domestically and internationally. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts established the framework for local self-governance in rural and urban areas respectively, devolving power to local bodies. Finally, Article 72 grants the President of India the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, including for death sentences. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect of CSS                                  Description
1. Funding Pattern (North Eastern States)    :   90:10 (Centre:State)
2. Funding Pattern (Other States)             :   60:40 (Centre:State)
3.  Monitoring Body                            :   NITI Aayog
4.  Funding Route to States                   :   Consolidated Fund of the State
5.  Basis of Current Framework                 : Sub-Group of Chief Ministers report (2015)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are accurate reflections of the features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in India.  The funding pattern for CSS varies depending on the state;  8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States receive a 90:10 Centre:State funding ratio, while other states receive 60:40. NITI Aayog plays a significant role in monitoring these schemes.  All financial transfers for CSS are channeled through the Consolidated Fund of the State, ensuring transparency and accountability. The current framework for CSS is based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs from 2015.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Petition/Remedy                     Key Feature/Provision
1. Mercy Petition                             :  Article 72 empowers the President
2. Curative Petition                           :  Last constitutional remedy available after review petition dismissal
3.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)        :  Centrally sponsored scheme funded by Nirbhaya Fund
4.  Review Petition                            :  Article 137 of the Constitution
5.  Special Category Status (SCS)              :  Classification given by the Centre to states facing socio-economic disadvantages.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  A mercy petition is addressed to the President under Article 72 of the Constitution. A curative petition serves as the final legal recourse in the Supreme Court after a review petition has been rejected.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are a centrally sponsored scheme initiated to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases and are funded by the Nirbhaya Fund. Review petitions are governed by Article 137 of the Constitution. Finally, Special Category Status (SCS) is a designation granted by the central government to certain states to provide additional financial and developmental assistance.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision/Council                       Characteristic
1. Sixth Schedule (Article 244(2))          :   Based on Bardoloi Committee recommendations
2. Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)      :   Maximum 30 members (4 nominated, 26 elected)
3.  Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)   :   Covers specific tribes within an autonomous district
4.  Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)       :  Applicable under the Fifth Schedule
5.  Powers of ADCs and ARCs                  :   Include legislation on forest management, agriculture, and social customs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately describe aspects of the Sixth Schedule and related bodies. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), originates from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. ADCs have a maximum of 30 members, with a mix of nominated and elected representatives. ARCs are established to cater to the specific needs of particular tribes within an autonomous district.  Importantly, TACs are associated with the Fifth Schedule, not the Sixth.  The powers of ADCs and ARCs extend to legislation on various matters, including forest management, agriculture, and social customs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**1. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme Feature
1. Mission Karmayogi: Aims to create a professional, well-trained civil service.
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan: Focuses on accelerating people’s participation in Panchayat Development Plans.
3. Nagar Van Yojana: Provides financial assistance of Rs. 4 lakh per hectare for urban forest creation.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi accurately aims to build a professional and well-trained civil service.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is correctly paired with its focus on enhancing public participation in the creation of Panchayat Development Plans. However, the statement about Nagar Van Yojana (NVY) is incorrect. While NVY does promote urban forestry and involves local communities, the financial assistance figure of Rs. 4 lakh per hectare is inaccurate.  The actual financial assistance provided under NVY varies and is not a fixed amount per hectare. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pair related to Nagar Van Yojana's funding.  Understanding the nuances of government schemes and their funding mechanisms is crucial for UPSC preparation.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate information regarding government initiatives.


**2. With reference to  Auditing of Local Bodies, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                     Function/Characteristic
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2. AuditOnline application: Developed by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG): Exercises control over the audit of only Urban Local Bodies.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is correctly matched with its aim of establishing global standards for auditing local governance.  The AuditOnline application, while used for online auditing of panchayat accounts, is developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development as stated in option 2.  Furthermore, the CAG's mandate extends to auditing both Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), making option 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include the mismatched pairs related to the AuditOnline application's developer and the CAG's scope of audit. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the institutional framework for local body audits in India and the roles played by different entities.  Accurate understanding of these entities and their functions is crucial for comprehensive preparation.


**3.  With reference to  Special Category Status (SCS) and Special Packages, consider the following pairs:**

    Item                                 Characteristic
1. Special Category Status: Grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
2. Special Packages: Provided only to states facing geographical challenges.
3. Fourteenth Finance Commission: Recommended the continuation of SCS.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are incorrectly matched.  While SCS was historically associated with grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, this is no longer the case after the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.  Special Packages are not limited to states facing only geographical challenges; socio-economic factors also play a role.  Finally, the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS, not its continuation.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of financial assistance mechanisms for states in India.  The changing nature of these mechanisms and the role of the Finance Commissions are important aspects of governance.


**4. With reference to  Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                     Description
1. Random Number: Captures details like caste, religion, income, health, geography, etc.
2. Proof of address and Identity:  Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship.
3. Targeted Delivery: Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched.  The Aadhaar number is a random number and does not capture any personally identifiable information like caste, religion, income, etc., making statement 1 incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address but not citizenship, contradicting statement 2.  While Aadhaar can be used for targeted delivery of benefits, it is not mandatory for opening bank accounts, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Aadhaar system, its features, and its limitations.  The Supreme Court's judgment on Aadhaar is relevant here, emphasizing the importance of privacy and data security.


**5. With reference to the  Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    Item                                       Feature
1. Sixth Schedule:  Applies to the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Bardoloi Committee: Recommended the inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule.
3. Article 244(2):  Deals with the administration of tribal areas in the Northeast.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Sixth Schedule applies to specific tribal areas in four states of Northeast India, not the entire state of Jammu and Kashmir.  The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations did not directly address the inclusion of Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule; the demand is a recent development. Article 244(2) correctly deals with the administration of tribal areas in the Northeast, as outlined in the Sixth Schedule. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the mismatched pairs related to the applicability of the Sixth Schedule and the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the constitutional provisions related to tribal administration.  Understanding the intricacies of the Sixth Schedule and its historical context is crucial.


**6. With reference to  Cantonment Boards, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                       Function/Characteristic
1. Cantonment Boards:  Administered directly by the state governments.
2.  Recent News: Land portions from 10 cantonment boards merged with concerned state local bodies.
3.  Land administered by cantonment boards:  Always falls under the concurrent list.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Cantonment Boards are administered by the Ministry of Defence, not directly by state governments. While recent news indicates the merging of land portions from some cantonment boards with state local bodies, this doesn't change the primary administrative control. The land administered by cantonment boards is not always under the concurrent list; it is governed by specific laws and regulations. Therefore, only pair 2 reflects a correct statement. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings related to the administrative control of cantonment boards and the legal status of their land.  This question tests the candidate's awareness of the administrative structure related to cantonment areas in India and recent developments affecting them.


**7. With reference to  Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Item                                         Characteristic
1. CSC SPV: Established under the Information Technology Act, 2000.
2. National e-Governance Plan (NeGP): CSCs are one of its three pillars.
3. Services offered by CSCs: Primarily focused on G2G services.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was set up under the Companies Act, 1956, not the Information Technology Act, 2000.  The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) correctly includes CSCs as one of its three pillars.  CSCs offer a diverse range of services, including G2C (Government-to-Citizen), B2C (Business-to-Citizen), and financial services, not primarily G2G (Government-to-Government) services. Therefore, only pair 2 is accurately matched. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the CSC scheme, its role in the national e-governance plan, and the services it provides.  Understanding the digital infrastructure and its impact on service delivery is important for UPSC preparation.


**8. With reference to the  World Press Freedom Index (WPFI), consider the following pairs:**

    Item                                   Characteristic
1. WPFI 2024: Released by the United Nations.
2. India's ranking in WPFI 2024:  Improved significantly compared to previous years.
3. Reporters Without Borders (RSF): A leading NGO promoting freedom of information.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  The World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) is released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not the United Nations.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 did not show a significant improvement; it remained relatively low.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is accurately described as a leading NGO advocating for freedom of information.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international rankings related to press freedom and the organizations involved in such assessments.  Familiarity with global indices and their implications is relevant for UPSC.


**9. With reference to  Mercy Petitions and Curative Petitions, consider the following pairs:**

    Petition Type                                   Feature
1. Mercy Petition:  Can only be filed by the convict.
2. Curative Petition:  Available after the dismissal of a review petition.
3. Article 72:  Deals with the President's power to grant pardons, including for death sentences.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  A mercy petition can be filed by the convict or on their behalf by others, making statement 1 incorrect.  A curative petition is correctly paired with its availability after the dismissal of a review petition.  Article 72 accurately deals with the President's power to grant pardons, including those related to death sentences.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of legal remedies available to convicts and the constitutional provisions governing such procedures.  Knowledge of these processes is crucial for understanding the Indian judicial system.


**10. With reference to  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Item                                         Characteristic
1. FTSCs:  Exclusively handle cases under the POCSO Act.
2. Funding for FTSCs:  Comes entirely from state budgets.
3. Objective of FTSCs: To ensure swift disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. FTSCs handle various cases, including rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, but they are not exclusively limited to POCSO cases, making statement 1 incorrect.  The funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, not solely from state budgets, making statement 2 incorrect.  The objective of FTSCs is accurately described as ensuring the speedy disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the FTSC scheme, its funding mechanism, and its intended objectives.  Understanding the judicial reforms aimed at addressing specific crimes is essential for UPSC.


**1. With reference to the Indian legal system, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                     Description
    1. Article 72                               :   Empowers the President to commute death sentences
    2. Article 137                               :   Relates to the Supreme Court's power of review
    3. Article 142                               :   Grants the Supreme Court power to do complete justice
    4.  Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008             :   Establishes courts at intermediate panchayat headquarters.
    5. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971           :   Defines civil and criminal contempt of court.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the punishment of any person convicted of any offense, including death sentences.  Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments.  Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice in any case before it, a crucial provision for ensuring equitable outcomes. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes a system of village-level courts, and their location at intermediate panchayat headquarters is a key feature. Finally, the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework for dealing with contempt of court, differentiating between civil and criminal contempt.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. With reference to special provisions for states in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision/Concept                         Feature
    1. Special Category Status (SCS)          :   Currently granted to several Northeastern and Himalayan states based on Sub-Group of Chief Ministers' recommendations.
    2. Article 282                              :   Empowers the Centre to make discretionary grants for any public purpose.
    3. Sixth Schedule of the Constitution     :   Provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states.
    4.  Article 371 (and subsequent clauses)   :   Provides a wide range of special provisions for several states.
    5. Special Financial Packages             :   Discretionary support for states facing geographical and socio-economic challenges.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Special Category Status (SCS), while previously a formal categorization, is now functionally applied through special provisions and funding patterns recommended by bodies like the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers. Article 282 of the Constitution allows the central government to make discretionary grants, a crucial mechanism for providing financial assistance to states. The Sixth Schedule details administrative arrangements for tribal areas in specific states. Articles 371 and its subsequent clauses provide special provisions tailored to the unique circumstances of several states. Finally, special financial packages offer additional financial support to states grappling with geographical or socio-economic challenges.  Therefore, option (c) is the accurate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. With reference to the Indian electoral system, consider the following pairs:**

    Concept/Act                                  Description/Feature
    1. EVM-VVPAT System                        :   Includes a Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail for increased transparency.
    2. Model Code of Conduct (MCC)            :   Guidelines for political parties and candidates to ensure free and fair elections.
    3. Association for Democratic Reforms vs ECI :   Supreme Court case concerning EVM verification.
    4.  Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL)       :   Manufactures EVMs.
    5. Election Commission of India (ECI)        :   Issues directives on MCC violations.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (c) 2, 3, and 5 only
    (d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched.  The EVM-VVPAT system incorporates a paper trail to enhance transparency and voter confidence. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) provides guidelines to maintain the fairness of elections. The Association for Democratic Reforms vs ECI case involved a legal challenge to the EVM system's verification process. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) is a key manufacturer of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs). The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for issuing directives and enforcing the Model Code of Conduct.  Therefore, option (b), which includes all the pairs, is correct. Other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. With reference to governance and administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Program                              Characteristic/Function
    1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)       :   Handle rape cases and POCSO Act cases.
    2.  Nirbhaya Fund                           :   Funds FTSCs.
    3.  Department of Justice, Ministry of Law :   Implements FTSCs.
    4.  Citizen's Charter                         :   A component of Mission Karmayogi.
    5.  Capacity Building Commission (CBC)      :   Part of Mission Karmayogi.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
    (c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All but one pair are correctly matched.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are specifically designed to expedite the resolution of rape cases and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  The Nirbhaya Fund provides financial support for their operation. The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for implementing the FTSC scheme. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is indeed a part of Mission Karmayogi. However, the Citizen's Charter is a separate concept related to service delivery and transparency, not directly a component of Mission Karmayogi itself. Therefore, option (b) is the correct answer. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits pair 5.  Option (c) is wrong because it includes pair 4 incorrectly. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes pair 4.


**5. With reference to local governance in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Concept                            Feature/Function
    1. Cantonment Boards                      :   Administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
    2.  Ministry of Defence                    :   Has administrative control over Cantonments.
    3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL)  :   Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
    4.  People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan):   Focuses on accelerating people’s participation in Panchayat Development Plans.
    5.  Panchayat Development Index (PDI)     :   A multi-domain index assessing panchayat development.


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    (c) 2, 3, and 5 only
    (d) 1, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Cantonment Boards are indeed governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006. The Ministry of Defence exercises administrative control over cantonments. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance. The People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan) promotes greater public participation in the development planning process at the panchayat level. Finally, the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is a multi-sectoral index used to evaluate the progress of panchayats.  Therefore, option (b), which includes all five pairs, is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                  Characteristic
1. Passport issued in India                :   Available in red, white, and blue colours
2.  CBI Director Selection Panel          :   Comprises the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India
3.  The Model Code of Conduct (MCC)       :   Enforceable through provisions in statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951
4.  Common Service Centres (CSCs)         :   Established under the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)
5.  Inner Line Permit (ILP)               :   Applicable to NRIs, PIO Card holders, and OCI holders


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 2:** The CBI Director's selection panel indeed comprises the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. This reflects the importance given to maintaining the independence and impartiality of the agency.  The composition ensures a balance of executive, legislative, and judicial oversight.

* **Pair 3:** While the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) doesn't have statutory backing, its violations can be addressed through provisions within existing laws like the Representation of the People Act, 1951. This demonstrates how the MCC, despite its non-statutory nature, exerts influence on electoral conduct.  The legal framework provides avenues for redressal against violations.

* **Pair 4:** Common Service Centres (CSCs) are integral to the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), aiming to extend government services to rural areas. This reflects the government's commitment to digital empowerment and inclusive governance.  CSCs function as crucial access points for various government and private services.

Pair 1 is incorrect as Indian passports are issued in blue, white, and maroon, not red. Pair 5 is incorrect because NRIs, PIO cardholders, and OCI holders are *not* eligible for ILPs; they require Protected/Restricted Area Permits.  These inaccuracies highlight the importance of precise factual recall in governance-related questions.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                 Provision/Feature
1.  Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946 :  Governs the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
2.  73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992 :   Relate to local self-governance
3.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023     :   Explicitly mentions the ‘right to be forgotten’
4.  Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873        :   Origin of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system
5.  Companies Act, 1956                           :   Governs the establishment of Common Service Centres (CSC) SPV


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct as pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 1:** The Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, is the legal framework governing the CBI's operations.  This highlights the legal basis for the CBI's investigative powers and its role within the Indian legal system.

* **Pair 2:** The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 are foundational to the structure of local self-governance in India.  These acts established Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), respectively, playing a significant role in decentralization.

* **Pair 4:**  The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 are the historical origin of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, designed to regulate access to certain areas in Northeast India.  Understanding this historical context helps in analyzing the contemporary implications of the ILP system.

* **Pair 5:** The Companies Act, 1956, is the legal framework under which the CSC SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) was established.  This underscores the legal structure supporting the implementation of the CSC scheme and its role in delivering citizen services.

Pair 3 is incorrect. While the European GDPR includes the "right to be forgotten," the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does not explicitly mention it.  This demonstrates differences in data protection approaches across jurisdictions.  The inclusion of such a right is a matter of ongoing discussion and debate within the Indian legal framework.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                             Key Function/Characteristic
1.  Cabinet Committees                         :   Constitutional bodies mentioned in the Constitution of India
2.  Parliamentary Privileges Committee (Lok Sabha) :   Consists of 10 members nominated by the Speaker
3.  Rajya Sabha                               :   Elects members using proportional representation through a single transferable vote
4.  Finance Commission                           :   Recommends the sharing of resources between the Union and States
5.  Committee on Official Language               :   Submits recommendations to the Prime Minister


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.

* **Pair 3:** The Rajya Sabha indeed uses proportional representation with a single transferable vote system for electing its members. This reflects a specific electoral mechanism designed to ensure representation for different groups.

* **Pair 4:** The Finance Commission is constitutionally mandated to advise on the distribution of resources between the Union and States.  This highlights the crucial role of the Finance Commission in maintaining fiscal balance and equitable resource allocation.

Pair 1 is incorrect; Cabinet Committees are extra-constitutional. Pair 2 is incorrect; the Lok Sabha's Privileges Committee has 15 members, not 10.  Pair 5 is incorrect; the Committee on Official Language submits recommendations to the President, not the Prime Minister. These inaccuracies underscore the need for precise knowledge of institutional structures and procedures.  Understanding the nuances of these differences is crucial for analyzing the Indian political system.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body                      Key Function/Characteristic
1.  Central Vigilance Commission        :   Non-statutory body combating corruption
2.  Union Public Service Commission     :   Conducts civil services examinations
3.  NITI Aayog                          :   Replaced Planning Commission
4.  Law Commission                       :   Advises on legal reforms

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) is a non-statutory body established to combat corruption in government.  The Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) is responsible for conducting the civil services examination and recruiting candidates for various government positions. NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission in 2015,  serving as a policy think tank. Finally, the Law Commission of India advises the government on legal reforms and the codification of laws.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Understanding the roles and characteristics of these key governmental bodies is crucial for comprehending Indian governance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                       Provision/Feature
1.  Post Office Act, 2023              :   Repeals the 1998 Act
2.  73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts :   Provisions on local self-governance
3.  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
4.  Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005 :   Coordinates agency is Department of Personnel and Training


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the key provisions and features of the respective Acts and Amendments. The Post Office Act, 2023, replaced the 1998 Act.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments introduced provisions for local self-governance in India. The FCRA is indeed implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Department of Personnel and Training serves as the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.  There are no incorrect pairings or misleading information. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of key legislation related to governance, administration, and transparency in India.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                    Key Feature/Objective
1.  Mission Karmayogi                  :   Shift from rule-based to role-based training
2.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan                  :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
3.  Common Service Centres (CSCs)      :   Three pillars of National e-Governance Plan
4.  Co-Districts Initiative              :   Decentralizing administration in Assam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Mission Karmayogi focuses on shifting from rule-based to role-based training for civil servants. Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims at preparing Panchayat Development Plans.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) are indeed one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), along with connectivity and national data banks/state data centers.  Finally, the Co-Districts Initiative in Assam is designed to decentralize administration and bring services closer to the people. Understanding these initiatives is critical for evaluating government strategies towards capacity building, rural development, and administrative efficiency.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Passport                Color
1. Ordinary Passport              :   White
2. Diplomatic Passport            :   Maroon
3. Official Passport               :   Blue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The colors associated with Indian passports are different from those given in the options.  Ordinary passports are blue, diplomatic passports are white, and official passports are maroon.  This question tests factual knowledge about passport types and their associated colors in India.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, highlighting the importance of accurate recall of details.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                  Location of Headquarters
1. Reporters Without Borders (RSF)   :   Geneva
2. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Rajkot
3. International Solar Alliance (ISA) :   Gurugram

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, and the International Solar Alliance (ISA) is headquartered in Gurugram, Haryana. However, Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is headquartered in Paris, not Geneva. This question tests the knowledge of the locations of headquarters of various international and national organizations. The inclusion of an incorrect pairing acts as a strong distractor, requiring precise factual recall.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Mechanism        Constitutional Article
1.  Devolution of taxes between Union and States  :   Article 275
2.  Grants-in-aid to states             :   Article 270
3.  Borrowing powers of the Union Government  :   Article 292

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Article 292 of the Indian Constitution deals with the borrowing powers of the Union Government.  However, Article 270 deals with the devolution of taxes between the Union and States, and Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid to states.  This question tests the understanding of the constitutional provisions related to financial distribution in India.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of constitutional articles.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Grievance Redressal Mechanism/Platform      Description/Characteristic
1. CPGRAMS                                     :   Single portal for lodging grievances
2.  E-Nivaran                                   :   Launched by CBDT
3.  Sevottam Model                               :   Focuses on improving quality of public service delivery
4.  Pro-Active Governance and Timely Implementation (PRAGATI) :   Multi-purpose platform to address grievances


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. CPGRAMS is a single-window portal for citizens to lodge grievances. E-Nivaran is a platform launched by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to address taxpayer grievances.  The Sevottam Model is designed to improve the quality of public service delivery, and PRAGATI is a multi-purpose platform for addressing grievances and monitoring government programs. This question assesses knowledge of different grievance redressal mechanisms used in Indian governance.  The comprehensive nature of the correct option and the accuracy of all pairings make this a challenging question.


**1. With reference to Local Self-Governance and its Audit in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Institution                                      Key Feature/Responsibility
1. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :  Established the AuditOnline application for online audit of panchayat accounts
2. Ministry of Panchayati Raj                         : Developed the AuditOnline application, awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)     : Exercises control and supervision over the auditing of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through ELFA/DLFA.
4. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies and is located in Rajkot, Gujarat.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 laid the foundation for local self-governance in India, but the AuditOnline application was developed later by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj did indeed develop the AuditOnline application and received the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 for it. The CAG's role in auditing local bodies stems from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, and it is carried out primarily through the ELFA/DLFA system across states.  Finally, the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  Therefore, options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option 1 incorrectly links the 1992 amendments directly to the AuditOnline application; the application is a later development building upon the framework established by the amendments.


**2. With reference to the Central Government's engagement with States, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Mechanism                                  Key Characteristic/Feature
1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)              : Funding pattern for Core Schemes is 90:10 for 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States, and 60:40 for Other States.
2. 14th Finance Commission                           : Abolition of Plan-Non Plan distinction from 2017, making CSSs and Central Sector schemes the primary mode of specific purpose transfers.
3. 15th Finance Commission                           :  Vertical devolution share of states from divisible pool stands at 41%.
4. Grants-in-Aid                                    : Provided by the Centre to states as per Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) do indeed follow the described funding pattern based on the region of the state. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish the Plan-Non Plan distinction fundamentally altered the method of central transfers to states. The 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% vertical devolution share of the divisible pool for states.  Finally, the provision for grants-in-aid to states from the Centre is explicitly mentioned in Article 275 of the Constitution. Therefore, the correct option is (d).


**3. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanisms in India, consider the following pairs:**

  Mechanism/Platform                                 Key Feature/Characteristic
1.  Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) : Conceptualized and designed the Governance Reform Assessment Index (GRAI).
2.  CPGRAMS                                          : A 24x7 online platform for citizens to lodge grievances connected to all Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and States.
3.  Sevottam Model                                   : Includes modules on Citizen’s Charter, Grievance Redressal Mechanism, and Capability Building for Service Delivery.
4.  Governance Reform Assessment Index (GRAI)        : Presents an organization-wise comparative picture regarding Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRMs).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  DARPG plays a central role in designing and implementing GRMs and did conceptualize the GRAI. CPGRAMS is accurately described as a 24/7 online grievance redressal platform connected to various government entities. The Sevottam model explicitly includes the three modules mentioned.  Finally, the GRAI does indeed provide an organizational comparison of GRMs. Therefore, the correct answer is (d).



**4. With reference to Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                         Key Feature/Responsibility
1. Public Accounts Committee                         :  Consists of 22 members (15 from Lok Sabha, 7 from Rajya Sabha).
2. Estimates Committee                             :  Consists of 30 members, all from the Lok Sabha.
3. Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL): Reviews progress in the use of Hindi for official purposes and submits recommendations to the President.
4. Committee of Privileges (Rajya Sabha)            : Investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges and consists of 10 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the key features and responsibilities of the respective Parliamentary Committees. The Public Accounts Committee's composition and the Estimates Committee's membership are correctly stated.  The PCOL's role in reviewing Hindi usage and submitting recommendations to the President is accurate. Lastly, the Committee of Privileges in Rajya Sabha's responsibility for investigating privilege breaches and its nomination process are also correctly described.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of NHRC                                   Specific Detail
1.  Legal Basis                                      : Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, as amended in 2006 and 2019.
2.  Appointment of Chairperson and Members        : Appointed by the President of India based on recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister.
3.  Powers of NHRC                                  :  Possesses all the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
4.  Headquarters                                     : New Delhi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The NHRC's establishment and legal framework are correctly linked to the PHRA, 1993, and its subsequent amendments. The process of appointing the Chairperson and members, involving a committee headed by the Prime Minister, is accurately described. The NHRC's extensive powers, including those of a civil court, are also a correct reflection of its mandate.  Finally, the location of its headquarters in New Delhi is factual. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                      Key Feature
1. Telecommunications Act, 2023             : Repeals Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 and Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933
2. Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024 :  Establishes a three-member Review Committee at the state level
3. Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 : Governs internet shutdowns based on public safety grounds
4. Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 :  Provides for the registration of Zero FIRs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, significantly overhauls the legal framework for telecommunications in India, replacing the outdated Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.  This makes pair 1 correct.  The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, explicitly address the legal basis for internet shutdowns in India, making pair 3 correct. The Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, incorporates the provision for Zero FIR registration, aligning with recommendations from the Justice Verma Committee, thus pair 4 is also correct.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, focuses on preventing unfair means in public examinations and outlines penalties. It does not establish a three-member review committee at the state level; that function is associated with the 2017 Rules concerning telecom service suspensions.  The inclusion of a state-level review committee is a crucial element differentiating the regulatory mechanisms.  Therefore, option (b) is the most accurate representation of the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine/Principle                      Description
1. Doctrine of Coverture                         :  Treats a married woman as a single entity with her husband
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction          :  Relates to the discretionary power of a court to extend time limits
3. Anti-Defection Law                           :  Deals with disqualification of MLAs who voluntarily give up party membership.
4.  Mercy Petition                               :  Deals with the President's power to pardon convicts sentenced to death.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Coverture, originating from English common law, indeed treated a married woman as legally subsumed under her husband, impacting her property rights and legal standing.  The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction is a legal principle guiding courts in interpreting statutes to avoid conflicts between different provisions. The Anti-Defection Law (10th Schedule) addresses the disqualification of legislators who switch parties.  The President's power to grant pardons, including commutation of death sentences, is established through the process of mercy petitions.  All four pairs accurately reflect the core essence of the respective legal concepts.  Therefore, option (b) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer. The other options incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law/Policy                                 Key Provision/Feature
1.  Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005        :  Replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002
2.  Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019     :  Reduced naturalization period to 5 years for certain migrants
3.  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)       :  Appeals against its decisions lie with TDSAT.
4.  Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024: Offenses are cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act, 2005, indeed superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. The CAA, 2019, notably reduced the naturalization period for specified categories of migrants. The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) establishes an appeals process through the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). The Public Examination Act, 2024, categorizes offenses under its purview as cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable, ensuring stringent enforcement.  All four pairs accurately reflect a key aspect of the respective laws or policies.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, including all four pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Institution                                  Function/Responsibility
1.  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Monitors compliance and imposes penalties related to data breaches.
2.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)         :  Conducts the Civil Services Examination.
3.  State Finance Commission                        :  Advises the state government on financial matters.
4.  Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)             :  Deals with corruption complaints within the government.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The UPSC's primary function is conducting the Civil Services Examination and recruiting for various government positions. State Finance Commissions advise state governments on financial distribution and resource allocation. The CVC combats corruption within government agencies.  However, the NCSC's role focuses on safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes; it is not involved in data breach monitoring and penalties.  This makes pair 1 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.  Other options incorrectly include pair 1.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court/Legal Process                          Key Feature/Characteristic
1.  Supreme Court Judgement in Anuradha Bhasin vs. Union of India :  Held that freedom of speech and expression through the internet is a fundamental right.
2.  Curative Petition                             :  The last available constitutional remedy after a review petition is dismissed.
3.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)           :  Focus on the swift disposal of rape cases and POCSO Act cases.
4.  Zero FIR                                     :  Registered irrespective of the area where the offense is committed.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The Anuradha Bhasin case established the fundamental right to internet freedom. Curative petitions are indeed the last resort in the Supreme Court after review petitions are rejected. FTSCs are designed for faster adjudication of sexual assault cases. Zero FIRs can be filed at any police station, regardless of the crime's location. All four pairs accurately describe the key characteristics of the respective legal processes.  Therefore, option (c) is correct, encompassing all four pairs. Other options incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                     Key Feature/Entity
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                  :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26
2. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Online audit of panchayat accounts
3. AuditOnline application              :   Global standards for auditing local governance bodies
4.  People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)      :   Launched in 2018 as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC), is correctly matched with its primary aim: the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26.  The initiative focuses on accelerating people's participation in this planning process.  The PPC was indeed launched in 2018 under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.

Option (b) is incorrect because iCAL aims to set global standards, not conduct online audits.  AuditOnline is correctly linked to online auditing of panchayat accounts, not setting global standards. Option (c) incorrectly links AuditOnline with global standards, which is the function of iCAL. Option (d) omits the correct pairing of iCAL with its function, and the correct pairing of AuditOnline with its function.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate pairings from a set of plausible distractors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                     Provision/Feature
1. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992 :   Established permanent Lok Adalats for public utility services
2. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987  :   Provisions on local self-governance
3. CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 :   Mandate for audit of Local Bodies
4.  Post Office Act 2023               :  Appointment of Director General of Postal Services (DGPS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 are fundamentally concerned with establishing provisions for local self-governance.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, is primarily focused on establishing and defining the structure and powers of Lok Adalats, not local self-governance. The CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, outlines the Comptroller and Auditor General's mandate, which includes auditing local bodies.  The Post Office Act 2023 correctly includes the appointment of the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS).  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the key functions of different legislative acts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Grievance Redressal Mechanism Entity/Initiative           Function/Characteristic
1. Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) :   Conceptualized and designed the Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI)
2. Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat    :   Online platform for lodging grievances
3. CPGRAMS                                               :   Handles grievances at the district level
4.  District Magistrate                                      :   One of two designated nodal agencies in the Union Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

DARPG is correctly paired with its role in conceptualizing and designing the GRAI.  The Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, and DARPG are the two designated nodal agencies in the Union Government for handling grievances, not CPGRAMS. CPGRAMS is an online platform, not a district-level entity.  District Magistrates often serve as District Public Grievance Officers, but not exclusively. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the roles of different organizations within the grievance redressal system.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                           Key Provision/Feature
1. Telecommunications Act 2023            :   Repeals Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933
2. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Prohibits receipt of foreign funds from certain sources
3. Post Office Act 2023                   :   Regulates OTT platforms
4. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987    :   Mediation agreements are binding and enforceable


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act 2023 correctly repeals the older acts mentioned. The FCRA correctly has provisions regarding the prohibition of foreign funds from certain sources.  The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, correctly includes the provision that mediated settlements are legally binding.  However, the Post Office Act 2023 does not regulate OTT platforms; that falls under separate legislation.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific legislative acts and their provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                       Specific Application/Impact
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                   :   Targeted delivery of government benefits/subsidies
2. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Mandatory Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers
3. Telecommunications Act 2023          :   Creation of a Digital Bharat Nidhi
4.  Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987    :   Establishment of permanent Lok Adalats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2,3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Aadhaar Act, 2016, facilitates targeted delivery of government benefits and subsidies through its unique identification system. The Telecommunications Act 2023 establishes the Digital Bharat Nidhi. The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, is correctly linked to the establishment of permanent Lok Adalats.  The FCRA mandates Aadhaar submission for NGO office-bearers to receive and manage foreign contributions.  Therefore, options 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question assesses the practical applications and impacts of different legislative frameworks.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution     Provision Related to
1. Article 72                         : Power of President to grant pardons
2. Article 137                        : Review petitions in Supreme Court
3. Article 142                        : Power of Supreme Court to do complete justice
4. Article 19(1)(a)                   : Freedom of speech and expression
5. Article 19(2)                      : Reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments.  Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary for doing complete justice. Article 19(1)(a) guarantees the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression, while Article 19(2) outlines the permissible restrictions on this right. Therefore, option (d) encompassing all five pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                    Key Feature
1. Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987    :   Established permanent Lok Adalats
2. Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), 1908  :   Governs procedures in civil courts
3.  Indian Telegraph Act, 1885           :   Regulates telecom services (now repealed)
4.  Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act :   Deals with sexual offences against children
5. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 : Includes the 'right to be forgotten'


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987,  did indeed establish the framework for Lok Adalats, including the provision for permanent Lok Adalats. The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, lays down the procedures for civil courts in India. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, previously governed telecommunication services before being repealed.  The POCSO Act specifically addresses sexual offences against children.  However, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* include the "right to be forgotten," unlike the GDPR in Europe.  Therefore, option (d) is correct as it includes all the correctly matched pairs except the last one. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Initiative           Implementing Ministry/Body
1. Mission Karmayogi                    :   Capacity Building Commission (CBC)
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                    :   Ministry of Panchayati Raj
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)   :   Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice
4.  Digital Bharat Nidhi                  :  Central Government
5.  Nirbhaya Fund                         :  Supports FTSCs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi is indeed implemented by the Capacity Building Commission. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) falls under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  The Fast-Track Special Courts are implemented by the Department of Justice. The Digital Bharat Nidhi is managed by the Central Government. And, crucially, the Nirbhaya Fund provides financial support for the Fast-Track Special Courts.  All five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Organization                      Jurisdiction/Function
1. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) :   Handles grievances related to data breaches
2. Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) :  Hears appeals against DPBI decisions
3. Supreme Court                            :   Quashes arbitral awards
4. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance
5.  MHA (Ministry of Home Affairs)          : Implements FCRA


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) indeed handles grievances related to data breaches.  TDSAT hears appeals against DPBI decisions. The Supreme Court has the power to quash arbitral awards. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to set global standards for auditing. Finally, the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible for implementing the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA).  All five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not reflect the complete accuracy of the pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Petition                    Court/Body Involved
1. Mercy Petition                      : President of India
2. Curative Petition                   : Supreme Court
3. Review Petition                      : Supreme Court
4. Mediation Settlement Agreement     : Enforceable like court judgments
5.  Arbitral Award                       : Can be quashed by Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The President of India handles mercy petitions. The Supreme Court deals with curative petitions. The Supreme Court also handles review petitions.  Mediation settlement agreements are legally binding and enforceable, similar to court judgments.  And, the Supreme Court can indeed quash arbitral awards.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

     Article                                         Provision
1. Article 244(2)                               :   Formation of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
2. Article 280                                   :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
3. Article 371                                   :   Special Provisions for certain States and Union Territories
4. Article 282                                  :   Power to make grants for any public purpose
5. Article 324                                  :   Power of superintendence, direction and control of elections


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 244(2) deals with the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which empowers the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs in specified states. Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Article 371 provides special provisions for certain states, addressing unique regional needs and concerns. Article 282 empowers both the Central and State governments to make grants for any public purpose, not necessarily restricted to their legislative competence. Article 324 vests the Election Commission with the power to supervise, direct, and control all elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, the offices of the President and Vice-President.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Election Process in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Act/Code                                    Key Feature
1.  Representation of the People Act, 1951       :   Deals with electoral offences like impersonation
2.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC)                :   Applies to all political parties during elections, lacks statutory backing
3.  Indian Penal Code (IPC)                      :   Contains provisions for prosecuting violations of the MCC
4.  Bhartiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS)                :   Contains provisions related to electoral offences
5.  The Cantonments Act, 2006                   :   Governs the administration of Cantonment Boards


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Representation of the People Act, 1951, indeed deals with various electoral offences. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) applies to all political parties and candidates during the election period, but it's crucial to note that the MCC is not a statute and hence lacks direct legal enforceability.  While the IPC and BNS contain provisions that can be used to prosecute certain actions that violate the spirit of the MCC, the MCC itself doesn't have its own enforcement mechanisms. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is unrelated to the election process.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the BNS. Options (c) and (d) incorrectly include the IPC and the Cantonments Act, respectively.


**3. With reference to Special Status for States in India, consider the following pairs:**

     State/Concept                            Characteristic
1.  Special Category Status (SCS)              :   Based on recommendations of Finance Commissions, ceased to exist after 14th FC
2.  Special Financial Packages                :   Discretionary grants under Article 282, not necessarily need-based
3.  Fifth Finance Commission                    :   First introduced Special Category Status (SCS)
4.  Fourteenth Finance Commission              :   Recommended discontinuation of SCS
5.  Article 371                                  :   Provides for special provisions for certain states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Special Category Status (SCS) was indeed a classification used to provide additional financial and developmental assistance to states facing socio-economic challenges, based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions; it was discontinued after the 14th Finance Commission. Special financial packages are discretionary grants under Article 282, not always tied to a specific need. The Fifth Finance Commission introduced the SCS concept, while the Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended its cessation.  Article 371 provides for special provisions for certain states, enabling tailored approaches to their unique circumstances.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to governance structures in India, consider the following pairs:**

     Entity                                     Key Feature
1.  Cantonment Boards                          :   Administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006
2.  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)       :   Established under Article 244(2) of the Constitution
3.  Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)            :   Operate under the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution
4.  Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs)         :   Audited using the AuditOnline application developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj
5.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):  Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. Cantonment Boards are governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006. ADCs are established under Article 244(2) of the Constitution. TACs function under the Fifth Schedule. The AuditOnline application facilitates the auditing of PRIs. iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to protected areas in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Area                                         Status/Location
1.  Arunachal Pradesh                          :   Entirely designated as a Protected Area
2.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands                   :   Entirely designated as a Restricted Area
3.  Sikkim                                      :   Partly Protected Area, partly Restricted Area
4.  Protected Areas                             :   Located in states like Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand
5.  Restricted Areas                            :   Access for foreigners requires special permits


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a protected area. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as restricted areas. Sikkim has a mix of protected and restricted areas. Protected areas are present in several states, including those mentioned.  Foreigners require special permits to enter restricted areas.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting one or more correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Act                     Key Feature/Provision
1. Cantonments Act, 2006                  :   Administered under the Ministry of Defence
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act      :   Deals with local self-government of cantonments
3. Article 244(2)                           :   Relates to the formation of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)
4. Article 72                               :   Empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc.
5. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008              :   Establishes courts at intermediate Panchayat headquarters

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, which are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with urban local bodies, and the administration of cantonments falls under its purview regarding local self-governance. Article 244(2) pertains to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which establishes provisions for Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in certain states of Northeast India.  Article 72 outlines the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes Gram Nyayalayas (village courts) at the headquarters of intermediate Panchayats.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correctly matched pair related to Article 72 (President's pardon powers). Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing of Article 72. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes the pairing of Article 244(2) with Cantonments.


**2. With reference to Centre-State relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Concept                         Description
1. Seventh Schedule                           :   Defines the tax bases between the Union and States
2. Article 269                               :   Taxes levied and collected by the Centre but wholly assigned to States
3. Article 282                               :   Empowers the Centre and States to make discretionary grants
4. Article 3                                  :   Deals with the formation of new States
5. Sixth Schedule                             :   Empowers the Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution clearly delineates the powers and responsibilities of the Union and State governments, including the allocation of tax bases. Article 269 specifies that certain taxes levied and collected by the Union government are assigned to the states.  Article 282 empowers both the Union and State governments to make grants for any public purpose, even beyond their legislative competence, encompassing discretionary grants. Article 3 of the Constitution deals with the formation of new states and alteration of existing state boundaries. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specific states. All the pairs are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Indian judicial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Procedure                   Description/Provision
1. Contempt of Court                         :   Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
2. Mercy Petition                             :   Covered under Article 72 of the Constitution
3. Curative Petition                          :   A last resort remedy after review petition dismissal
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)       :   Handle rape and POCSO Act cases under a centrally sponsored scheme
5.  Right to be Forgotten (RTBF)             : Explicitly mentioned in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines contempt of court. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, including considering mercy petitions. A curative petition is the last legal recourse available to a litigant after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are established under a centrally sponsored scheme to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* explicitly mention the right to be forgotten. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correct pairing for FTSCs. Option (c) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes the pairing of RTBF with the Digital Personal Data Protection Act. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Order/Scheme                         Key Feature/Provision
1. Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958 :   Deals with Protected Areas between the Inner Line and International Border
2. Inner Line Permit (ILP)                   :   Regulates movement in protected areas, aiming to protect tribal cultures
3. Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations, 1873:   Historical genesis of the ILP system
4.  Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963:  Covers Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim
5.  National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)      :  Includes Common Service Centres (CSCs) as a key component


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, designates areas between the Inner Line and the International Border as Protected Areas, requiring permits for entry. The Inner Line Permit (ILP) system regulates entry into these areas, primarily to protect the unique cultural heritage of tribal communities.  The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 represent the historical origin of the ILP system. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, declares certain areas, including the entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim, as Restricted Areas. The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) includes Common Service Centres (CSCs) as a crucial element for delivering government services to rural citizens.  All five pairs are correctly matched, making (d) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. With reference to  governance and administration, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Act/Scheme                      Characteristic/Function
1.  iCAL (Integrated Capacity Building for Audit of Local Governance) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies
2. AuditOnline application                      :  Developed by Ministry of Panchayati Raj for online audit of Panchayat accounts
3. CAG (Comptroller and Auditor General)      :   Mandate for audit of Local Bodies flows from CAG’s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971
4.  World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023: Awarded to AuditOnline application
5.  Ministry of Electronics & IT              : Oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme through a special purpose vehicle (SPV)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

iCAL is a collaborative platform designed to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates the online audit of Panchayat accounts. The CAG's authority to audit local bodies stems from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971. The AuditOnline application received the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023. The Ministry of Electronics & IT oversees the implementation of the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme through a dedicated SPV. Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanisms in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Mechanism                                   Key Feature
    1. CPGRAMS                               :   Handles grievances related to service delivery at the state level only
    2. Directorate of Public Grievances       :   Operates under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions
    3. Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) :  Developed the GRAI tool for comparative analysis of GRMs
    4.  E-Nivaran                              :  A platform launched by CBDT to address taxpayer grievances.
    5. Sevottam Model                          : Includes modules on Citizen's Charter and Capability Building for Service Delivery

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because it accurately matches the mechanisms with their key features.  CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) is a pan-India online portal for lodging grievances with various ministries and departments at both the central and state levels, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Directorate of Public Grievances operates under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P), making statement 2 correct. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is responsible for developing tools like GRAI (Grievance Redressal Assessment Index) to evaluate grievance redressal mechanisms, thus validating statement 3. E-Nivaran is a platform initiated by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) to expedite the resolution of taxpayer grievances, confirming statement 4.  Finally, the Sevottam model, aimed at improving public service delivery, includes modules focusing on Citizen's Charters, Grievance Redressal Mechanisms, and Capability Building, making statement 5 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of governance mechanisms in India.


**2. With reference to the Auditing of Local Bodies in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                    Responsibility/Function
    1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL)  :   Audits utilization of funds granted by the central government to local bodies
    2. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)             :   Operates under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj
    3. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)/Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) : Works under the technical guidance of the Ministry of Finance
    4. AuditOnline application                   : Awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023
    5. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts : Introduced provisions for online audit of Panchayat accounts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correctly matched. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, received the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.  Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL sets global standards for auditing, not directly auditing funds. Statement 2 is incorrect; the CAG's mandate stems from the CAG Act, 1971, not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. Statement 3 is incorrect; ELFAs/DLFAs work under the CAG's guidance, not the Ministry of Finance. Statement 5 is incorrect; the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts established provisions for local self-governance, but AuditOnline is a subsequent development.  The question tests knowledge of the institutional framework for auditing local bodies in India and the role of technology in improving accountability.


**3. With reference to the Panchayati Raj System and Planning, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Plan                                     Key Aspect
    1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign)     :  Launched in 2019
    2. Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)               : Prepared at the district level only
    3. Panchayat Development Index (PDI)                 : A multi-domain index assessing Panchayat performance
    4. Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP)            : Published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal
    5. Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas                        :  A different name for the Jan Yojana Abhiyan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The PDI is a multi-domain index, GPDPs are published on e-Gram Swaraj, and "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" was an earlier name for Jan Yojana Abhiyan. Statement 1 is incorrect; Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018. Statement 2 is incorrect; PDPs are prepared at all three tiers of Panchayats. The question assesses understanding of the planning process within the Panchayati Raj system and the tools used for monitoring and evaluation.


**4. With reference to the President's Powers and Legal Processes in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Legal Process/Power                                 Constitutional Basis/Key Feature
    1. Mercy Petition                                   :   Can only be applied for offences against Union laws
    2. Curative Petition                               :  A remedy available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court
    3. Article 72                                      :  Deals with the President's power to grant pardons
    4. Article 137                                     :  Grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments
    5. Article 142                                     :  Source of the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Curative petitions are filed after review petitions are dismissed, Article 72 addresses the President's pardon powers, and Article 142 underpins the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction. Statement 1 is incorrect; mercy petitions can be for various offences, not just those against Union laws. Statement 4 is correct in its description but is not directly related to the curative petition itself. The question tests knowledge of constitutional provisions related to presidential powers and the judicial review process in India.


**5. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity/Concept                                      Role/Function
    1. Data Principal                                  :  Has the right to seek correction and erasure of personal data
    2. Data Fiduciary                                  :  Must inform the DPBI about data breaches
    3. Digital Personal Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) :  Appoints data protection officers for all data fiduciaries
    4. Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)               :  Are subject to additional obligations, including appointing an independent data auditor
    5. TDSAT                                           :  Hears appeals against DPBI decisions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Data principals have the rights mentioned, data fiduciaries have the obligations listed, SDFs have additional obligations including appointing independent data auditors, and TDSAT hears appeals against DPBI decisions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the DPBI doesn't appoint data protection officers for all data fiduciaries; that's the responsibility of the SDFs.  The question tests understanding of the roles and responsibilities defined under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Statutory Body             Key Feature/Mandate
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)    :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The NHRC is indeed a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was a key component of the launch of Mission Karmayogi in 2021. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is correctly identified as the first of its kind in India with the stated aim. The Standing Committee on Statistics (SCoS) accurately described its key responsibilities related to survey methodologies and advising the central government. Therefore, option (c) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.

**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Governmental Initiative/Scheme            Prominent Feature
1.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign) :   Launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018
2.  Mission Karmayogi                       :   Aims to create a professional, well-trained civil service
3.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) Scheme   :   One of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)
4.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)         :   Centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019, funded by Nirbhaya Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key feature of the respective governmental initiative or scheme. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was indeed launched under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018.  Mission Karmayogi's primary goal is to improve the professionalism and training of the civil service. The CSCs scheme is correctly identified as a core component of the NeGP. Finally, FTSCs are correctly described as a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 and funded through the Nirbhaya Fund.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Indian Postal System, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Provision                                  Key Aspect
1.  DGPS (Directorate General of Posts)           :   Power to intercept postal articles on specified grounds
2.  Article 282 of the Constitution              :   Empowers the Centre to make discretionary grants
3.  East India Company's Postal System             :   Opened its first post office in 1727

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The DGPS does indeed possess the power to intercept postal articles under specific circumstances. Article 282 of the Constitution grants the central government the authority to provide discretionary grants. The East India Company's establishment of its first post office in 1727 is a well-documented historical fact. Lastly, Lord Dalhousie's significant contribution to the Indian Postal System involved recognizing it as a distinct national entity.  Consequently, option (d) is the correct answer because it encompasses all the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and inaccurate.

**4. With reference to Financial Provisions and Resource Allocation in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision/Body                  Key Function/Responsibility
1.  Article 270                                  :   Distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union between the Union and States
2.  15th Finance Commission                      :   Recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the functions and responsibilities of the respective constitutional provisions and bodies. Article 270 clearly outlines the distribution of taxes between the Union and the States. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendation regarding the 41% share of the divisible pool for states is correct. Article 292 correctly details the Union government's borrowing powers. Finally, Article 275 accurately describes the provision for grants-in-aid to states by the Centre. Therefore, option (d), encompassing all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of the RTI Act                                  Key Feature
1.  Central Information Commission (CIC) Members   :   Appointed by the President on the recommendation of a committee including the Prime Minister
2.  Public Authorities (PAs) under RTI Act           :   Include government bodies, state-controlled entities, and substantially government-funded NGOs
3.  Section 8 of the RTI Act                           :   Specifies information exempt from disclosure
4.  RTI Act 2005                                    :   Replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key features of the RTI Act, 2005. The appointment process of CIC members is correctly described.  The definition of Public Authorities under the RTI Act accurately includes the entities mentioned. Section 8 correctly deals with exemptions. The replacement of the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, by the RTI Act, 2005 is also accurate. Thus, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes all four correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and inaccurate.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Key Characteristic
1.  Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993        :   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC)

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately connect the act/policy with its key characteristic. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, is directly responsible for establishing the NHRC. The Companies Act, 1956, provided the legal framework for setting up the CSC SPV.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, established the DPBI. The RTI Act, 2005, established the CIC.  Therefore, option (d), encompassing all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**7. With reference to Special Status and Financial Assistance to States, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Policy                                  Key Feature
1.  Special Category Status (SCS)                  :   No longer exists following recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission
2.  Special Packages to States                    :   Provided under Article 282 of the Constitution
3.  Grants-in-Aid to States                       :   Provided as per Article 275 of the Constitution
4.  Central Sector Schemes (CSSs)                 :   Funding routed through Consolidated Fund of the State


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately describe the provision/policy and its key feature. The Special Category Status (SCS) is correctly identified as no longer in existence after the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission. Special Packages to states are correctly linked to Article 282.  Grants-in-aid are accurately connected to Article 275. The routing of CSS funding through the Consolidated Fund of the State is also correct.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes all four correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Court Procedure/Remedy                        Key Feature
1.  Mercy Petition                               :   Power granted to the President under Article 72 of the Constitution
2.  Curative Petition                             :   Last constitutional remedy available after dismissal of a review petition
3.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)            :   Aim to ensure swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases
4.  Arbitral Award                               : Can be quashed by the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly match the court procedure/remedy with its key feature. The President's power to grant mercy petitions is correctly linked to Article 72. The curative petition's status as the last resort is accurate.  The FTSCs' aim of faster disposal of cases is correct.  The Supreme Court's power to quash arbitral awards is also accurate. Therefore, option (d), encompassing all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                      Key Feature/Responsibility
1. Public Accounts Committee                    :   Examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)
2. Estimates Committee                         :   Scrutinizes the demands for grants presented to Parliament
3. Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU)   :   Reviews the working of public sector undertakings

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) is a crucial parliamentary committee that examines the CAG's audit reports on the government's revenue and expenditure. This ensures accountability and transparency in government finances.  The Estimates Committee scrutinizes the government's budget proposals (demands for grants) before they are approved by Parliament, helping to improve efficiency and effectiveness in resource allocation.  The Committee on Public Undertakings (COPU) focuses specifically on the performance of public sector undertakings, assessing their profitability, efficiency, and adherence to good governance principles.  All three committees play distinct but vital roles in parliamentary oversight and governance. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question is designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the functions of key parliamentary committees, highlighting their importance in the Indian parliamentary system.


**2. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                         Provision
1. Article 72                                    :   Power of the President to grant pardons
2. Article 137                                   :   Power of the Supreme Court to review its judgments
3. Article 142                                   :   Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments, allowing for corrections or reconsiderations if necessary. Article 142 is a crucial provision that enables the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary to do complete justice, even if it means exceeding its ordinary powers.  This ensures the Supreme Court can effectively resolve complex cases and ensure equitable outcomes.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to recognize the accuracy of all three pairings. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of key constitutional provisions related to presidential and judicial powers, emphasizing their significance in maintaining the rule of law and upholding justice.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                             Implementing Ministry/Agency
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                         :   Ministry of Panchayati Raj
2. Mission Karmayogi                           :   Department of Personnel & Training
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)           :   NITI Aayog (for revamp)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, focusing on participatory Panchayat Development Plan preparation, falls under the purview of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. Mission Karmayogi, aimed at improving the capacity of government officials, is implemented by the Department of Personnel and Training. The NITI Aayog plays a significant role in the revamp and rationalization of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), which involve joint funding and implementation by the central and state governments. All three pairs correctly link the scheme/initiative with the responsible ministry/agency.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing at least one correct pairing. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of government schemes and their implementing agencies, demonstrating an understanding of the Indian administrative structure.



**4. With reference to grievance redressal mechanisms, consider the following pairs:**

   Mechanism                                     Key Feature
1.  Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM)       :   Time-bound and accessible grievance redressal
2.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)          :   Swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases
3.  Common Service Centres (CSCs)            :   Government service delivery points

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) aims to provide time-bound and accessible mechanisms for citizens to voice their concerns and have their grievances addressed efficiently. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are designed for the speedy trial and resolution of rape cases and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Common Service Centres (CSCs) act as front-end delivery points for various government and private sector services, extending access to rural citizens. All three pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective mechanisms.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various grievance redressal and service delivery mechanisms, highlighting their importance in good governance and citizen engagement.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court/Petition                         Jurisdiction/Purpose
1. Gram Nyayalayas                               :   Settlement of petty civil and criminal disputes at village level
2. Contempt of Court                             :   Punishment for willful disobedience of court orders
3. Curative Petition                             :   Last constitutional remedy for review petition dismissal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Gram Nyayalayas are established to resolve minor civil and criminal disputes at the village level, providing accessible justice.  Contempt of court refers to the legal process of punishing individuals or entities for willful disobedience or defiance of court orders, upholding judicial authority. A curative petition serves as the final recourse for individuals whose review petitions have been dismissed by the Supreme Court, ensuring the availability of all possible legal remedies.  All three pairs correctly associate the type of court/petition with its function or jurisdiction. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, leaving out at least one accurate matching. The question tests the candidate's understanding of different types of courts and legal processes, demonstrating knowledge of the Indian judicial system.


**1. With reference to the constitutional provisions related to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

   Provision/Feature                                 Detail
1. Initial Grant of SCS                         :   Based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
2. Constitutional Basis for SCS                 :   Explicitly mentioned in the Constitution under Article 370
3. Cessation of SCS                              :   Recommended by the 14th Finance Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first pair is correctly matched.  SCS states initially received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. This was a significant aspect of the financial arrangement for these states. The third pair is also correctly matched. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS status, leading to the current system where special funding for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on other recommendations rather than their SCS status.  However, the second pair is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly mention Special Category States in a single article like Article 370 (which dealt with J&K's special status, now revoked).  While the Constitution provides for special provisions under Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J for various states,  there's no single constitutional article defining or granting SCS status. This is a crucial distinction that highlights the difference between constitutional provisions and administrative classifications.  The inclusion of Article 370 as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the evolution of special status provisions within the Indian constitutional framework.


**2. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016 and its constitutional implications (Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of Aadhaar                                   Court Ruling
1. Metadata Retention Period                       :   Unlimited storage permitted
2. Applicability to Bank Accounts                    :   Mandatory for opening bank accounts
3. Sharing of Aadhaar Data with Private Entities    :   Permitted under specific government contracts

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are incorrectly matched. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. UoI* clarified several aspects of the Aadhaar Act.  First, it ruled that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, contradicting statement 1. Second, the court held that Aadhaar cannot be *forced* on people for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections, contradicting statement 2. The court also explicitly stated that the state cannot enter into contracts with private corporations for sharing of Aadhaar data, as it infringes on the right to privacy, thus contradicting statement 3.  The options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the Supreme Court's judgment on Aadhaar's constitutionality, especially concerning data privacy and mandatory usage.  The "None" option serves as a crucial distractor, ensuring that candidates understand the complete judgment and not just isolated parts.


**3. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Committee                                       Characteristic/Function
1. Public Accounts Committee                       :   Consists of members only from Lok Sabha
2. Estimates Committee                             :   Examines the government's revenue
3. Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL):  Established in 1963

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) was indeed constituted under Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963. The first pair is incorrect; the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) consists of members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. The second pair is also incorrect; the Estimates Committee's function is to examine the government's *expenditure*, not revenue. The PAC is responsible for auditing revenue and expenditure.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the composition and functions of different parliamentary committees, highlighting the differences between PAC and Estimates Committee.  The incorrect options are carefully chosen to resemble the correct answer, testing the candidate's precise understanding of each committee's role.


**4. With reference to the President of India's powers concerning mercy petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Sentence                                     Presidential Power under Article 72
1. Sentence by a Court Martial                       :   Cannot grant pardon, reprieve, etc.
2. Sentence for an offence against a Union Law       :   Can grant pardon, reprieve, etc.
3. Life Imprisonment                               :   Can only commute, not remit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences for offences against Union laws. The first pair is incorrect; the President *can* grant pardons, reprieves, etc., for sentences given by a Court Martial. The third pair is also incorrect; the President can remit (completely cancel) a life imprisonment sentence, in addition to commuting it (reducing it to a lesser sentence).  This question tests the detailed understanding of Article 72 and the scope of the President's mercy powers. The distractors are designed to be plausible, challenging the candidate to recall the precise extent of the President's powers in different sentencing scenarios.


**5. With reference to the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect of FTSCs                                  Detail
1. Funding Source                                 :   State Budgets
2. Implementing Ministry                           :   Ministry of Home Affairs
3. Type of Cases Handled                          :   Primarily civil cases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, not state budgets, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, implements FTSCs, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, making statement 2 incorrect. FTSCs primarily handle rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, not civil cases, making statement 3 incorrect.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the FTSCs scheme, its funding, and its area of operation.  The incorrect options are designed to be misleading, requiring the candidate to possess accurate knowledge of the scheme's details.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                     :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and specified tribal areas.
2. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                     :   Replaced by Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam
3. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                 :   Defines civil and criminal contempt of court
4. Aadhaar Act, 2016                             :   Mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes but not for bank accounts or mobile connections.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas from its purview.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, has indeed been replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework for defining and addressing contempt of court, distinguishing between civil and criminal contempt.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, as affirmed by the Supreme Court, makes Aadhaar mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes while upholding the right to privacy by not mandating it for bank accounts or mobile connections.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act/Institution                          Key Characteristic/Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                             :   Launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018
2. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies
3. AuditOnline application                        :   Awarded World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023
4. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)            :   Funding is solely provided by the central government.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan was indeed launched under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance.  AuditOnline application did receive the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023. However, Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, making option (d) incorrect. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Act/Provision                Feature/Power
1. Lokpal                                         :   Superintendence and direction over central investigation agencies for cases referred to it.
2. Sixth Schedule                               :   Result of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations.
3. Article 72                                    :   Empowers the President to grant pardons for offences against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
4. Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019     :   Conferred citizenship to those who migrated from East Pakistan to Assam between 1966 and 1971.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lokpal does possess the power of superintendence and direction over central investigation agencies for specific cases. The Sixth Schedule is indeed a product of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. Article 72 correctly outlines the President's pardon powers. However, the CAA, 2019, does *not* confer citizenship to those who migrated from East Pakistan to Assam between 1966 and 1971; that was a previous provision. The CAA deals with amending citizenship laws for religious minorities from neighboring countries.  Therefore, only three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of the incorrectly matched pair 4.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Commission/Act                      Responsibility/Function
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :   Deals with matters related to backward classes.
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)        :   Conducts civil services examinations.
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)              :   Exclusively handle cases under the POCSO Act.
4. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005           :   Provides citizens with access to information held by public authorities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NCSC deals with matters related to Scheduled Castes, not backward classes (that's the NCBC).  The UPSC conducts civil services examinations. FTSCs handle rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, but they are not *exclusively* for POCSO cases. The RTI Act empowers citizens to access information held by public authorities.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are completely correct. Pair 1 is partially correct, and pair 3 is incorrect. Option (c) reflects this accurately. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrect pair 3 or exclude the correct pair 4.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Amendment/Policy                             Key Feature
1.  73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992  :  Established Panchayati Raj Institutions
2.  Article 282                                          :  Allows discretionary grants by Centre and States
3.  Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964                 :  Established Foreigners Tribunals
4.  Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024               :  Enforces the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992, are foundational for the establishment and functioning of Panchayati Raj Institutions and Urban Local Bodies in India. Article 282 empowers the central and state governments to make discretionary grants for public purposes. The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, established the quasi-judicial Foreigners Tribunals. Finally, the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were explicitly created to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.  All four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Provision                                     Feature
    1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                    :   Exempts all Northeastern states
    2. Indian Evidence Act, 1872                     :   Applies to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings
    3. Article 142 of the Constitution                 :   Source of curative petition power
    4. Court of Session                              :   Appeals from criminal cases in Gram Nyayalayas


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, exempts only Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim and specified tribal areas, not all Northeastern states.  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, does *not* apply to Gram Nyayalaya proceedings; they are guided by principles of natural justice.  Article 142 is the source of the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, which underpins the curative petition process.  Appeals from criminal cases originating in Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Contempt                                  Description
    1. Civil Contempt                               :   Publication of matter scandalizing a court
    2. Criminal Contempt                            :   Wilful disobedience of a court order
    3. Article 129 of the Constitution                :   Grants power to High Courts to punish contempt
    4. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                  :   Defines and outlines procedures for contempt


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 4 only
    (c) 3 and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt includes actions like publishing material that scandalizes or undermines the court's authority.  Article 129 grants the Supreme Court the power to punish for contempt, and a similar power is granted to High Courts under Article 215. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines and provides the legal framework for dealing with contempt of court. Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to Mercy Petitions and Curative Petitions, consider the following pairs:**

    Petition Type                                    Provision/Feature
    1. Mercy Petition                               :   Governed by Article 72
    2. Curative Petition                            :   First established in Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra
    3. Article 137 of the Constitution                :   Deals with review petitions
    4. President of India                            :   Can commute death sentences


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., including commuting death sentences, which is central to the process of mercy petitions.  The curative petition, a final recourse after review petition dismissal, was established through the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra*. Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's power to review its judgments, making review petitions a prerequisite for a curative petition.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following pairs:**

    Court Type/Feature                                  Characteristic
    1. FTSCs                                        :   Established under Nirbhaya Fund
    2. ePOCSO Courts                                 :   Deal exclusively with POCSO Act cases
    3. Department of Justice, Ministry of Law & Justice :   Responsible for FTSC implementation
    4. 2026                                          :   Year FTSC scheme concludes


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.  ePOCSO Courts are a subset of FTSCs focusing solely on cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.  The Department of Justice manages the implementation of the FTSC scheme. The scheme's current extension is up to 2026.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to Citizenship by Naturalization, consider the following pairs:**

    Requirement/Feature                            Specific
    1. Knowledge of a language listed in the 8th Schedule:  Necessary for citizenship by naturalization
    2. Proof of nationality                          :   Can include Aadhaar cards
    3. Renunciation of other citizenship             :  Required for approval of Indian citizenship
    4. Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955       :   Governs the electronic application process


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Applicants for citizenship by naturalization must demonstrate knowledge of a language from the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution.  They can provide various documents, including Aadhaar cards, as proof of entry into India.  Renunciation of foreign citizenship is mandatory for approval. Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955, outlines the electronic application process through designated committees.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following pairs:**

    CAA Feature                                    Specification
    1.  Religious groups covered                     :   Includes Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians
    2.  Migrant entry deadline                       :   December 31, 2014
    3.  Excluded areas                               :   Include areas under the Inner Line Permit system
    4.  Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920        :   Migrants exempted from its penal consequences


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The CAA specifically mentions Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians as eligible religious groups.  The Act sets December 31, 2014, as the cutoff date for the entry of eligible migrants.  Areas under the Inner Line Permit system and certain tribal areas are excluded.  The CAA exempts eligible migrants from the penal consequences of the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and the Foreigners Act, 1946.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**7. With reference to the Lokpal, consider the following pairs:**

    Lokpal Wing/Feature                            Description
    1. Inquiry Wing                                 :   Submits reports within 60 days
    2. Prosecution Wing                             :   Headed by the Director of Prosecution
    3.  Powers of Lokpal                            :   Includes superintendence over CBI for referred cases
    4. Chairperson Appointment Eligibility          :  Total tenure not exceeding five years


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Lokpal's Inquiry Wing investigates alleged offenses and submits reports within 60 days. The Prosecution Wing, headed by the Director of Prosecution, handles the prosecution of cases. The Lokpal has significant powers, including overseeing CBI investigations for referred cases.  The Lokpal Chairperson's total tenure is limited to five years.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**8. With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following pairs:** *(Note:  Information on NCBC is limited in the provided text. This question is designed to be a difficult distractor, highlighting the need for broader knowledge beyond the given source.)*

    NCBC Feature                                  Characteristic
    1. Constitutional Status                         :   Defined by Article 341
    2.  Composition                                 :   Includes members from various states
    3.  Powers                                      :   Determining backwardness of communities
    4.  Legal Basis                                  :   Based on Article 338B


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)  *(Note: While Article 341 relates to Scheduled Castes and not directly to the NCBC, this is a plausible distractor given the context of the other questions.)*

**Explanation:**

This question tests knowledge beyond the provided text.  While the text does not provide details about the NCBC's composition, powers, or exact constitutional basis, the plausible distractors are designed to test the candidate's deeper understanding of related constitutional bodies.  The NCBC does determine backwardness, and it has a legal basis rooted in the constitution.  However, the exact Article defining its status may not be directly stated in the provided text. The correct answer focuses on the facets of the NCBC that are generally known, while making use of plausible distractors from related constitutional provisions.


**9.  With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

    RTI Feature                                     Specifics
    1.  Central Information Commission (CIC) members:  Appointed by the President
    2.  Freedom of Information Act, 2002            :  Preceded the RTI Act
    3.  Applicability                               :   Includes substantially government-funded NGOs
    4.  Section 8 of the RTI Act                    :   Specifies exemptions from disclosure


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The President appoints the CIC members based on a committee's recommendation. The Freedom of Information Act, 2002, was indeed replaced by the RTI Act.  The RTI Act's applicability extends to various public authorities, including substantially government-funded NGOs. Section 8 of the Act explicitly lists exemptions from information disclosure.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**10. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and sub-classification, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision/Concept                               Characteristic
    1. Article 341(1)                               :   Allows for sub-classification of SCs
    2. Article 341(2)                               :   Prohibits sub-classification of SCs
    3.  State of Punjab & Others v Davinder Singh    :   Upheld the permissibility of sub-classification
    4.  Substantive equality                         :   Considers historical injustices


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 4 only
    (d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 341(1) deals with the President's power to specify Scheduled Castes, and the Supreme Court case *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh* affirmed that sub-classification within the SCs is permissible. Substantive equality, a key concept in affirmative action, acknowledges historical injustices and seeks to address them. Article 341(2) allows Parliament to modify the list of Scheduled Castes, it does not prohibit sub-classification. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  This highlights the importance of carefully understanding the nuances of constitutional provisions.


**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision                     Specific Provision
1. Article 270                               :   Taxes levied and collected by the Union, distributed between Union and States
2. Article 275                               :   Grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to States
3. Article 292                               :   Union government's power to borrow money within or outside the country
4. Article 280                               :   Establishment of the Finance Commission

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States.  Article 275 outlines the provision for grants-in-aid from the Centre to States. Article 292 explicitly grants the Union government the power to borrow both domestically and internationally. Finally, Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of financial resources.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the specific constitutional provisions governing fiscal federalism is crucial for comprehending the intricate financial relationship between the Union and State governments in India. This demonstrates a strong grasp of the constitutional framework underlying India's federal system.


**2. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State                                      Characteristic
1. Jammu & Kashmir (pre-2019)           :   Received SCS based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
2. Andhra Pradesh                           :   Currently holds Special Category Status
3. Sikkim                                   :   Granted SCS after 1969
4. Nagaland                                 :   One of the initial states granted SCS in 1969


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jammu and Kashmir (before its reorganization in 2019) was indeed granted Special Category Status and received funding based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  Sikkim and Nagaland were among the initial recipients of SCS in 1969. Andhra Pradesh's claim for SCS has been a significant political issue, but it has not been granted this status. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair related to Andhra Pradesh or exclude correctly matched pairs related to J&K, Sikkim, and Nagaland.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the historical context and evolution of the SCS policy in India, including the discontinuation of the SCS designation itself following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.


**3. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme, consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                    Detail
1.  Governing Body                           :   Ministry of Electronics & IT
2.  Legal Framework                         :   Companies Act, 1956
3.  National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) Pillar:  National Data Bank/State Data Centres
4.  Service Category Provided              :    G2C services only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The CSC SPV, which oversees the CSC scheme, was indeed set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT and is governed under the Companies Act, 1956. The National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) comprised three pillars: Connectivity, National Data Bank/State Data Centres, and Common Service Centres (CSCs).  However, CSCs offer a broader range of services than just G2C; they also include B2C and financial services.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning the service categories provided by CSCs. Option (a) and (c) are also incorrect, as they omit crucial correctly matched pairs. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the CSC scheme's structure, governance, and its role within the larger framework of the National e-Governance Plan.


**4. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following pairs:**

    Provision                                 Specification
1.  Designated Account                       :   Any branch of any scheduled bank in India
2.  Validity of Registration                 :   Five years with renewal option
3.  Administrative Expenses Limit           :   20% of the total foreign contribution received
4.  Implementing Ministry                   :   Ministry of Home Affairs


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The validity of FCRA registration is five years, with a provision for renewal.  The permissible limit for administrative expenses is 20% of the total foreign contribution. The Ministry of Home Affairs is responsible for implementing the FCRA. However, the designated FCRA account must be in specified branches of the State Bank of India, New Delhi, not just any scheduled bank. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect either by including the incorrectly matched pair regarding the designated account or excluding correctly matched pairs related to the validity of registration, administrative expense limits, and the implementing ministry. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the FCRA's key provisions and regulatory aspects.


**5. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

    Feature                                   Description
1.  Data Storage                             :   Decentralized storage across multiple servers
2.  Proof of Identity                         :   Proof of Citizenship
3.  Targeted Delivery Mechanism             :   Utilizes UID-enabled bank account network
4.  Constitutional Validity                  :   Affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar's data is stored centrally, not decentralized.  Aadhaar is a proof of address and identity for residents of India, but it's not a proof of citizenship. Aadhaar does utilize a UID-enabled bank account network for targeted delivery, and the Supreme Court did affirm its constitutional validity in 2018. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs regarding data storage and proof of identity. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the technical features, legal aspects, and constitutional implications of Aadhaar.


**6. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following pairs:**

    Aspect                                     Detail
1. Funding Source                            :   Solely funded by the Central Government
2. Implementing Agency                      :   Usually implemented by the State Governments
3. Constitutional Basis                      :   State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution
4.  Rationalization Report                   :   Report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers (2015)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States, not solely by the Centre.  They are implemented by State Governments. Their constitutional basis lies in the State and Concurrent Lists. The 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers provided recommendations for the rationalization of CSSs.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair concerning funding or exclude correctly matched pairs related to implementation agencies, constitutional basis, and rationalization reports. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nature, implementation, and governance of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.


**7. With reference to the President's Power of Mercy, consider the following pairs:**

    Type of Sentence                           Constitutional Provision
1.  Death Sentence                           :   Article 72
2.  Sentence by Court-Martial                :   Article 72
3.  Sentence for Offenses against Union Laws :   Article 72
4.  Sentence for Offences against State Laws :   Article 161


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Articles 72 and 161 deal with the President and Governor's power of pardon, respectively.  Article 72 specifically covers death sentences, sentences by court-martial, and sentences for offenses against laws to which the executive power of the Union extends.  State laws fall under the Governor's power of mercy (Article 161). Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair concerning offenses against State laws or exclude correctly matched pairs related to death sentences, court-martial sentences, and Union law offenses.  This question tests the understanding of the constitutional provisions related to the President's power of mercy and its scope.


**8. With reference to the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, consider the following pairs:**

    Entity                                     Function
1.  Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA):  Set up consumer tribunals
2.  Consumer Mediation Cell                  :  Attached to District and State Commissions
3.  Product Liability Action                 :  Against manufacturers and service providers
4.  Misleading Advertisement Penalty         :   Up to Rs. 10 lakh fine and two years imprisonment for first offense


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CCPA does not set up consumer tribunals; that is the function of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission and other consumer forums.  Consumer Mediation Cells are attached to District and State Commissions. Product liability actions are indeed possible under the Act.  The penalty for misleading advertisements is correctly stated. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either wrongly include the function of setting up tribunals under CCPA or exclude correctly matched pairs concerning consumer mediation cells, product liability actions, and penalties for misleading advertisements.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the key features and provisions of the Consumer Protection Act.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

    State/Region                                 Feature
1.  Assam                                     :   Contains provisions for Autonomous District Councils
2.  Meghalaya                                 :   Does not fall under the Sixth Schedule
3.  Tripura                                   :   Contains provisions for Autonomous District Councils
4.  Ladakh (Demand for Inclusion)            :   Currently not included in the Sixth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states, including Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura.  Meghalaya is not covered under the Sixth Schedule.  There is a demand to include Ladakh, but it is not currently included. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either wrongly include Meghalaya or exclude correctly matched pairs concerning Assam, Tripura, and the demand for Ladakh's inclusion.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and its geographical scope.  The inclusion of Ladakh highlights current political and administrative debates.


**10. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Area                                       Status
1.  Entire Arunachal Pradesh                 :   Protected Area
2.  Parts of Himachal Pradesh                :   Restricted Area
3.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands                :   Restricted Area
4.  Part of Sikkim                            :   Restricted Area

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands and part of Sikkim are classified as Restricted Areas.  However, parts of Himachal Pradesh are classified as Protected Areas, not Restricted Areas. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include Himachal Pradesh under Restricted Areas or exclude correctly matched pairs concerning Arunachal Pradesh, Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and part of Sikkim.  This question assesses the candidate's understanding of the geographical demarcation of Protected and Restricted Areas in India and the implications for foreign visitors.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article              Provision Related To
1. Article 280                      :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
2. Article 275                      :   Grants-in-aid to states
3. Article 292                      :   Union government borrowing powers within and outside India
4. Article 246                      :   Tax bases between Union and States
5. Article 269-A                    :   Levy and Collection of GST in Inter-State Trade


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Article 280 of the Indian Constitution deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission.  This commission plays a crucial role in the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments. Article 275 empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance.  Article 292 outlines the borrowing powers of the Union government, both domestically and internationally. Article 246 clearly delineates the tax bases that are allocated to the Union and State governments, forming a fundamental aspect of India's fiscal federalism. Article 269-A specifically addresses the levy and collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in inter-state trade or commerce, a key aspect of India's indirect taxation system.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings.  The inclusion of Article 292 in option (c) is slightly misleading as it doesn't specifically mention *only* borrowing powers within India, but the primary focus is indeed on the Union's borrowing capabilities.




**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   State/UT                          Special Status/Provision
1.  Arunachal Pradesh                :   Sixth Schedule Area
2.  Sikkim                           :   Protected Area (entirely) and Restricted Area (partly)
3.  Nagaland                         :   Previously granted Special Category Status
4.  Jammu & Kashmir (before 2019) :   Previously granted Special Category Status
5.  Andaman & Nicobar Islands       :   Restricted Area (entirely)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Arunachal Pradesh is a state covered under the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, which provides for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils. Sikkim is unique in having parts of its territory designated as both Protected Areas and Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  Nagaland and Jammu & Kashmir (prior to the 2019 constitutional changes) were previously granted Special Category Status, a classification providing additional central assistance.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area, requiring special permits for foreign visitors. Thus, all the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court/Petition             Legal Basis/Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas                   :   Jurisdiction limited to civil disputes only
2. Contempt of Court                 :   Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
3. Curative Petition                  :   A remedy available after dismissal of a review petition
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):   Exclusively handle cases under the POCSO Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction.  Contempt of Court is indeed defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.  A curative petition is the last resort available in the Supreme Court after a review petition is dismissed.  However, FTSCs handle not only POCSO Act cases but also rape cases. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are entirely correct.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include one or more incorrectly matched pairs.  Option (a) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Instrument/Policy       Feature/Characteristic
1.  Net Borrowing Ceiling (NBC)    :   Monetary policy tool
2.  Special Category Status (SCS)  :   Based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (currently)
3.  Special Packages               :   Provided under Article 282
4.  Grants-in-Aid                   :   Provided under Article 275
5.  Central Sponsored Schemes (CSS):   Funding pattern is always 90:10 (Centre:State)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

The Net Borrowing Ceiling is a fiscal policy tool, not a monetary policy tool. While SCS used to be based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, this is no longer the case. Special Packages are indeed provided under Article 282, and grants-in-aid are provided under Article 275. The funding pattern for CSSs varies; it's not always 90:10. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are entirely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing. Only option (a) accurately reflects the correct matches.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Initiative                      Implementing Ministry/Body
1. Mission Karmayogi                   :   Ministry of Panchayati Raj
2. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                   :   Capacity Building Commission
3. Common Service Centres (CSCs)       :   Ministry of Electronics & IT
4. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Ministry of Defence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi falls under the Capacity Building Commission. Jan Yojana Abhiyan is implemented by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) are indeed overseen by the Ministry of Electronics & IT. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is not associated with the Ministry of Defence. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include one or more mismatched pairs. Only option (b) accurately identifies the correct match.


**1. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme Feature
1. CSS Funding Pattern for 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States : Centre:State = 50:50
2. CSS Monitoring Jurisdiction                      :  Exclusively NITI Aayog
3.  Abolition of Plan-Non Plan Distinction          :  Post 2017
4. Number of CSSs                               :  75 across 3 categories
5. Percentage of Centre's Budget Expenditure on CSSs: 20.4%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  The funding pattern for the 8 Northeastern and 3 Himalayan states under CSS is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 50:50 as stated in pair 1.  NITI Aayog has concurrent jurisdiction in monitoring CSSs along with other entities, not exclusive jurisdiction as mentioned in pair 2. The abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction happened in 2017, making pair 3 correct. The number of CSSs across 3 categories is indeed 75, making pair 4 correct.  The percentage of the Centre's budget expenditure on CSSs is approximately 10.4%, not 20.4% as stated in pair 5.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 reflect accurate information regarding CSSs in India. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the correctly matched pairs among several plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                    Detail
1. Launch Year of Capacity Building Commission : 2020
2. Target Group of NPCSCB                    :  All Union Government employees excluding contractual staff
3. Guiding Principle of Mission Karmayogi     :  Emphasis on rule-based training
4. Full form of NPCSCB                       : National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building
5. Aim of NPCSCB                             : Creation of a less professional civil service.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The Capacity Building Commission was launched in 2021, not 2020 (pair 1).  NPCSCB covers all civil servants, including contractual employees (pair 2). A core guiding principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift *from* rule-based to role-based training (pair 3). The full form of NPCSCB is correctly given in pair 4. The aim of NPCSCB is to create a *more* professional civil service (pair 5).  This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail to avoid the plausible distractors presented in the incorrect pairs. The candidate needs to accurately recall the launch year, target group, and core principles of Mission Karmayogi.


**3. With reference to the Finance Commission and Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                       Characteristic
1. 15th Finance Commission Recommendation     :  Vertical Devolution at 31%
2. Article 270                                 :  Taxes levied and collected by states, distributed to states
3. Article 293                                 :  State borrowing from outside India is permitted
4.  Basis of Horizontal Devolution              :  Income Distance (55%)
5. Article 275                                 :  Grants-in-aid to states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a vertical devolution of 41%, not 31% (pair 1). Article 270 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between the Union and States (pair 2). Article 293 states that state governments can borrow *within* India, not outside (pair 3). In horizontal devolution, Income Distance has a weight of 45%, not 55% (pair 4). Article 275 correctly pertains to grants-in-aid to states (pair 5). This question tests factual recall, requiring the candidate to remember specific articles of the Indian Constitution related to fiscal federalism and the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.


**4. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) and Special Packages in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                           Characteristic
1.  Year SCS was first introduced                    : 1979
2.  States granted SCS in 1969                     :  Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, Nagaland, Sikkim
3.  Basis for granting Special Packages             :  Explicit constitutional provision
4.  14th Finance Commission Recommendation        : SCS remains in effect
5.  Funding source for Special Packages             :  Article 282


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. SCS was first introduced in 1969, not 1979 (pair 1).  Sikkim was granted SCS later, making pair 2 incorrect. Special packages are discretionary and not based on an explicit constitutional provision (pair 3). The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS (pair 4). Article 282 correctly empowers the Centre to make discretionary grants for public purposes, including special packages (pair 5).  This question tests knowledge of the historical context of SCS, the constitutional basis for special financial assistance, and the recommendations of the Finance Commissions.  The distractors include incorrect years, inaccurate lists of states, and misconceptions about the legal basis for special packages.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                         Characteristic
1.  Article enabling the Sixth Schedule           :  Article 244(1)
2.  Bodies established under the Sixth Schedule  :  Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) only
3.  Number of ADCs currently in existence        : 12
4.  Power of ADCs and ARCs                       :  Cannot collect land revenue
5.  Recommendation for Sixth Schedule             :  Nehru Committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The Sixth Schedule is enabled by Article 244(2), not Article 244(1) (pair 1).  The Sixth Schedule also empowers the establishment of Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in addition to ADCs (pair 2). Currently, there are 10 ADCs, not 12 (pair 3). ADCs and ARCs do have the power to collect land revenue (pair 4). The Sixth Schedule resulted from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee (pair 5). This question tests detailed knowledge of the Sixth Schedule, including the relevant constitutional article, the types of councils established, their powers, and the committee that recommended its inclusion in the Constitution.  The distractors aim to test the candidate's precise understanding of the subject matter.  A superficial understanding would likely lead to incorrect answers.


**6. With reference to Local Self-Governance and its Audit in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                           Characteristic
1.  73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Act    :  Deals with local self-governance, not auditing
2.  AuditOnline Application                       :  Developed by Ministry of Rural Development
3.  CAG's Mandate for Auditing Local Bodies      :  Derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971
4.  Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)      :  Works independently of the CAG
5.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Located in Mumbai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts deal with local self-governance, they don't explicitly outline the auditing mechanisms (pair 1). AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development (pair 2).  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies is indeed derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971 (pair 3). ELFAs/DLFAs work under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not independently (pair 4). iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai (pair 5). This question tests detailed knowledge of the constitutional basis for local self-governance, the mechanisms for auditing local bodies, and the roles of different organizations involved in the process.  The distractors test the candidate's understanding of the specific roles and responsibilities of various ministries and agencies.


**7. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                         Characteristic
1.  Recent development related to Cantonment Boards:  Merger of land portions with state local bodies
2.  Legal basis for Cantonment Boards              :  Indian Constitution, Article 244
3.  Governance structure of Cantonment Boards     :  Directly under the Ministry of Defence
4.  Number of Cantonment Boards in India           :  62
5.  Primary Function of Cantonment Boards         :  Providing civilian amenities in cantonment areas only


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The recent news involves the merger of land portions from 10 cantonment boards with concerned state local bodies (pair 1). Cantonment Boards are established under various laws, not specifically under Article 244 of the Indian Constitution (pair 2). While they are overseen by the Ministry of Defence, they have their own governance structures (pair 3). The exact number of cantonment boards may vary, and 62 might not be entirely accurate (pair 4). Cantonment Boards have broader functions beyond civilian amenities, including military administration (pair 5). This question tests knowledge of current affairs related to Cantonment Boards and their organizational structure.  The distractors test the candidate's understanding of the legal basis for their existence, their governance, and their precise functions.






**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Provision
1. Article 72                        : Power of President to grant pardons
2. Article 82                         : Delimitation of constituencies for Lok Sabha
3. Article 99                         : Oaths of office for Members of Parliament
4. Article 104                       : Penalty for sitting in Parliament without oath
5. Article 137                        : Power of Supreme Court to review its judgments

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases. Article 82 deals with the delimitation of constituencies for the Lok Sabha, ensuring fair representation based on population.  Article 99 outlines the procedure for Members of Parliament (MPs) to take oaths of office before assuming their duties.  Article 104 prescribes penalties for MPs who participate in Parliament proceedings without having taken the required oath.  While Article 137 relates to the Supreme Court's power of review, it's important to note this is a self-review mechanism, not an appeal process. Therefore, all pairs 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment             Provision
1. Citizenship Act, 1955         : Permits dual citizenship
2. Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985: Added Section 6A to the Citizenship Act, 1955
3. Assam Accord                 :  Framework for granting Indian citizenship to certain groups
4. Section 6A of Citizenship Act, 1955 :  Deals with acquisition of citizenship by naturalisation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship Act of 1955 does not provide for dual citizenship; India recognizes only single citizenship. The Citizenship Amendment Act of 1985 is directly linked to the addition of Section 6A, a special provision addressing citizenship issues related to the Assam Accord.  The Assam Accord itself provided a framework for resolving the issue of illegal immigrants in Assam and granting citizenship to certain groups. Section 6A deals specifically with the acquisition of Indian citizenship in specific circumstances, not solely through naturalization, but rather through a path outlined by the Assam accord. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more crucial connections.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                   Detail
1. First Cantonment established               : Barrackpore in 1765
2. Governing Legislation                     : Cantonments Act, 2006
3. Number of Cantonments in India          : 70
4. Administrative Control                    : Ministry of Defence
5. President of Cantonment Board            : Station Commander (ex-officio)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Barrackpore was indeed the first cantonment established in 1765. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments in India. There are currently 61 cantonments (not 70),  The Ministry of Defence holds administrative control over cantonments. The Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include an incorrect pair (number of cantonments).


**4. With reference to the Supreme Court's powers, consider the following pairs:**

   Power                                      Legal Basis
1.  Review of its own judgments               : Article 137
2.  Issuing directions or orders              : Article 142
3.  Condoning delay in filing appeals           : Inherent power of the court
4.  Hearing curative petitions                 : Flows from Article 142
5.  Judicial Review of Delimitation Commission Orders:  Inherent power of the court to review manifestly arbitrary actions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 137 explicitly grants the Supreme Court the power to review its own judgments. Article 142 empowers the court to issue directions or orders necessary for doing complete justice. The power to condone delays in filing appeals is an inherent power of the court based on principles of equity and justice. Curative petitions, the last resort for legal redress, are rooted in the court's power under Article 142.  The Supreme Court possesses inherent powers to review decisions of other bodies if those decisions are demonstrably arbitrary or violate fundamental rights.  Therefore all pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Key Feature
1. Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023              : Replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860
2. Indian Penal Code, 1860                     :  Originally drafted under Thomas Babington Macaulay
3. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991:  Freezes the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947
4.  Limitation Act, 1963                        : Contains provisions for condonation of delay
5.  The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act:  Has dedicated Fast-Track Special Courts for speedy disposal of cases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, is a comprehensive criminal law that replaces the existing Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860. The IPC was indeed drafted under the leadership of Thomas Babington Macaulay. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, maintains the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947. The Limitation Act, 1963, includes provisions related to the condonation of delays in legal proceedings. The POCSO Act has a dedicated system of Fast-Track Special Courts to ensure the speedy trial of cases.  All five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect.



**6. With reference to Special Category States (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                             Detail
1.  Origin of SCS                                      : Recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission
2.  Funding mechanism for SCS (Historically)           : Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
3.  Constitutional basis for SCS                       : Explicit mention in the Constitution
4.  Current status of SCS                              : No longer exist
5.  Alternative funding for Northeastern states          : Based on recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The concept of Special Category States (SCS) originated from the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission. Historically, the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine the grants allocated to these states. The Constitution does not explicitly categorize any state as an SCS; special provisions were made through other articles. Following the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, the SCS category ceased to exist.  Northeastern and Himalayan states now receive special funding based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of a wrongly matched pair or exclusion of correctly matched pairs.


**7.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Commission                                   Key Function
1.  State Election Commission (SEC)                 : Delimitation of constituencies for local body elections
2.  Delimitation Commission                        :  Fixing boundaries of Lok Sabha and Legislative Assembly constituencies
3.  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Oversees the implementation of welfare schemes for Scheduled Castes
4.  Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)          : Conducts civil services examinations
5.  NITI Aayog                                      :  Formulates national development plans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While SECs are involved in the process, the delimitation of constituencies for local body elections is primarily the responsibility of the SECs, not a key function. The Delimitation Commission is specifically responsible for defining Lok Sabha and state assembly constituencies.  The NCSC monitors the implementation of welfare schemes for Scheduled Castes. The UPSC conducts civil services examinations. NITI Aayog plays a significant role in national development planning.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either omit correctly matched pairs or include a wrongly matched pair.


**8. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                              Detail
1.  Enactment Year                                      : 2005
2.  Replaced Act                                         : Freedom of Information Act, 2002
3.  Coordinating Agency                                 : Department of Personnel and Training
4.  International legal basis                           : Universal Declaration of Human Rights
5.  Landmark Supreme Court Case                       :  Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act was enacted in 2005. It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates its implementation. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides an international legal framework for the right to information. The Supreme Court case, Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government, played a significant role in establishing the right to information as a fundamental right. All five pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Doctrine/Concept                            Description/Origin
1. Doctrine of Coverture                               :  Legal concept from English common law
2. Doctrine of Harmonious Construction               : Origin traced to the Shankari Prasad case
3.  Condonation of Delay                             : Discretionary power of courts to extend time limits
4.  Mercy Petition                                     :  Power of the President under Article 72
5.  Curative Petition                                  : Last resort legal remedy available in the Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The doctrine of coverture originated in English common law. The doctrine of harmonious construction has its roots in the Shankari Prasad case. Condonation of delay is a discretionary power of courts to extend deadlines. The President's power to consider mercy petitions is enshrined in Article 72. Curative petitions are a final legal recourse available in the Supreme Court. All five pairs are correctly matched. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**10. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                            Detail
1.  Basis of the Sixth Schedule                     : Recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee
2.  Governing Bodies                               : Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)
3.  Power to make laws                              :  On subjects like forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, etc.
4.  Number of ADCs currently in existence           : 10
5. Applicability                                      :  Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. It establishes ADCs and ARCs. These bodies have the power to make laws on various subjects, including those listed.  There are currently 10 ADCs in existence. The Sixth Schedule applies to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                     Act/Amendment/Article
1. CAG                                      Article 151
2.  Delimitation Commission                 Article 324
3. National Human Rights Commission       Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
4.  Press Council of India                  Indian Press Council Act, 1978

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India is a constitutional body whose powers and duties are laid down in Articles 148 to 151 of the Indian Constitution.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Thus, pair 3 is correct.  The Press Council of India was re-established under the Press Council Act, 1978, after being dissolved during the Emergency. Hence, pair 4 is also correct.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the Delimitation Commission is appointed by the President of India under Article 82 of the Constitution (for Parliament) and Article 170 (for State Legislatures). It does not directly relate to Article 324 which deals with the Election Commission of India.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Institution                                   Key Feature/Responsibility
1. RTI Act, 2005                                  Replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002
2.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023      Regulates processing of digital personal data
3.  Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023            Replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
4.  97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011      Established the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, improving transparency and accountability. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, aims to protect citizens' digital personal data. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, modernizes evidence admissibility in Indian courts, replacing the outdated Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  The 97th Constitutional Amendment Act, 2011, enshrined the right to form cooperative societies as a fundamental right.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer encompassing all the correctly matched pairs.


**3.  With reference to Constitutional Bodies, consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                              Appointment/Tenure
1.  Central Information Commissioner                  President of India, 3-year term
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)            President of India, 6 years or until 65
3.  Chairperson, National Human Rights Commission   President of India, 3 years or until 70
4.  Director, CBI                                     Panel consisting of PM, Leader of Opposition and CJI, 2 years (previously)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Central Information Commissioner (CIC) is appointed by the President of India for a three-year term. The CAG is also appointed by the President for a six-year term or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.  The Chairperson of the NHRC is appointed by the President for a term of three years or until the age of 70.  The Director of the CBI was previously appointed for a two-year term by a panel comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.  While recent changes have extended the tenure, the original structure of appointment remains accurate for this question. Therefore, option (d) is correct.


**4. With reference to the Election Process in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                          Provision/Body
1.  Model Code of Conduct                         Article 324
2.  Superintendence, direction and control of elections  Election Commission of India
3.  Single-member constituency in Lok Sabha elections  Territorial representation
4.  Enforcement of Model Code of Conduct          Statutory backing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 only
(d) 1,2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 2 is correct: The Election Commission of India (ECI) has the power of superintendence, direction, and control of elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, the President, and the Vice-President, as per Article 324 of the Constitution. Pair 3 is also correct: Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of territorial representation, with each constituency electing only one representative (single-member constituency).  Pair 1 is incorrect: The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution; it is a set of guidelines issued by the ECI. Pair 4 is incorrect: The MCC lacks statutory backing; its enforcement relies on moral suasion and persuasive measures rather than legal penalties. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Provision/Characteristic
1.  RTI Act, 2005                                   Right to request information from a Public Authority
2.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023       Data principal's right to obtain information about processing
3.  Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS)      Release of undertrials who have spent more than a third of the maximum sentence
4.  Prohibition of Child Marriage Act (PCMA), 2006  Sets the minimum age of marriage at 18 for women and 21 for men

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The RTI Act, 2005, grants citizens the right to access information held by public authorities. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, gives data principals the right to know how their data is being processed. The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS) includes provisions for the release of undertrials who have served a significant portion of their potential sentence. The Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006, establishes the minimum legal age for marriage for both men and women.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all pairs are accurately matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Article                 Subject Matter
1. Article 270                            :   Distribution of taxes between Union and States
2. Article 275                            :   Grants-in-aid to states
3. Article 280                            :   Establishment of Finance Commission
4. Article 292                            :   Union government's borrowing powers within India only
5. Article 293                            :   State government's borrowing powers within and outside India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes and duties between the Union and the States.  Article 275 mandates the Union to grant financial assistance to States that are in need of such assistance.  Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, a crucial body for recommending the distribution of financial resources.  Article 292 grants the Union government the power to borrow money both within and outside India.  Crucially, Article 293 allows state governments to borrow only within India, not internationally.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include Article 292 or 293 which are mismatched. The inclusion of these incorrect pairings makes options (b), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Parameter                     Value (as of March 2023)
1. States’ revenue as percentage of revenue expenditure : 58%
2. States' debt-GDP ratio                   : 27.5%
3.  Share of States from divisible pool    : 41% (Based on 15th FC)
4. Weight assigned to Income Distance by 15th FC : 25%
5. Weight assigned to Tax and fiscal efforts by 15th FC : 10%

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The provided text states that states' revenue covers only 58% of their revenue expenditure, their debt-GDP ratio stands at 27.5%, and the share of states from the divisible pool is 41% as per the 15th Finance Commission.  These figures accurately reflect the data provided in the source. However, the weights assigned by the 15th Finance Commission to Income Distance and Tax and fiscal efforts are incorrectly stated in options (d) and (b). The 15th FC allocated 45% weight to Income Distance and 2.5% to Tax and fiscal efforts.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inclusion of these mismatched data points related to the 15th Finance Commission's weightage allocation.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following pairs:**

    State                                      Status
1. Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) in 1969       : Granted SCS
2. Andhra Pradesh in 2024                 : Granted SCS
3. Bihar in 2024                           : Granted SCS
4. Sikkim                                    : Granted SCS at a later date
5. Nagaland in 1969                       : Granted SCS


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions that Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted Special Category Status (SCS) in 1969.  It further notes that Sikkim and other states received SCS later.  The text does not support the assertion that Andhra Pradesh and Bihar were granted SCS in 2024;  it only mentions that they *demanded* it.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrect assertions about Andhra Pradesh and Bihar receiving SCS in 2024.  This demonstrates the importance of carefully evaluating the factual accuracy of each statement.  The question tests the ability to distinguish between demands for SCS and the actual granting of the status.


**4. With reference to Centre-State relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision              Subject Matter
1. Seventh Schedule                      :   Delineation of tax bases between Union and States
2. Article 269-A                         :   Levy and Collection of GST in intra-State Trade 
3. Article 269                           : Taxes levied and collected by Centre but wholly assigned to States
4. Article 282                           : Discretionary Grants
5. Article 244(2)                        : Sixth Schedule

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution clearly defines the division of powers and tax bases between the Union and the States. Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to the States. Article 282 empowers both the Centre and States to make grants for any public purpose. Article 244(2) is related to the Sixth Schedule, which deals with the administration of tribal areas. Article 269-A, however, deals with the levy and collection of GST in *inter-state* trade or commerce, not intra-state trade. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the mismatched pair (Article 269-A) or exclude correctly matched pairs.  The question emphasizes the need for precise understanding of constitutional provisions related to Centre-State financial relations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Financial Provision                     Description
1. Vertical Devolution                     :   Distribution among states from their allocated share
2. Horizontal Devolution                  :   Share of states from divisible pool
3. Grants-in-Aid                          :   Provided by Centre as per Article 275
4.  Borrowing by States                   :   Requires prior consent of Union if indebted
5.  Borrowing by Union                    :   Can borrow within and outside India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of the divisible pool between the Union and the States, while horizontal devolution is the distribution *among* the states from their allocated share.  Grants-in-aid are provided by the Centre to states as per Article 275.  If a state is indebted to the Union, it needs prior consent for further borrowing. The Union can borrow both within and outside India.  Therefore only pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly pair vertical and horizontal devolution and incorrectly include or exclude other pairs.  This question highlights the nuances of fiscal federalism and the importance of understanding the precise meanings of key terms.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                  Key Feature/Provision
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                         :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26
2. Aadhaar Act, 2016                          :   Mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes but not for bank accounts
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)       :   Funded jointly by the Centre and States, implemented through States
4. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                  :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is explicitly focused on preparing Panchayat Development Plans for 2025-26, making statement 1 correct.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act affirmed its constitutionality while specifying that Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but not for other services like bank accounts or mobile connections, thus making statement 2 accurate. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are indeed jointly funded by the Centre and States and implemented through the States, validating statement 3.  Finally, the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, does contain exemptions for certain states and tribal areas, confirming statement 4.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Institution                           Primary Function/Characteristic
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Global standards for auditing local governance bodies
2. Capacity Building Commission (CBC)        :   Part of Mission Karmayogi, focusing on civil service training
3. Common Service Centres (CSCs)             :   Front-end delivery points for government services in rural areas
4.  AuditOnline application                   : Awarded World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is indeed established to set global standards for auditing local government bodies. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is a key component of Mission Karmayogi, driving civil service capacity building initiatives. Common Service Centres (CSCs) function as the primary delivery points for government and other services in rural India. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, received the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**3.  With reference to the Indian Constitution and its amendments, consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision/Act               Related Subject/Feature
1. Article 72                                :   President's power on mercy petitions
2. Article 282                               :   Discretionary grants by Centre and States
3. Article 244(2)                            :   Provisions related to the Sixth Schedule
4. Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J  : Special provisions for certain states (replacing SCS)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences, including those related to mercy petitions. Article 282 empowers both the central and state governments to make grants for any public purpose. Article 244(2) is directly linked to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states.  Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J provide special provisions for various states, replacing the earlier system of Special Category States. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to the Indian judicial system, consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept/Procedure                   Description/Application
1. Contempt of Court                         :   Defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971
2. Curative Petition                          :   Last resort remedy after review petition dismissal by Supreme Court
3. Mercy Petition                             :   President's power to pardon or commute sentences
4. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)         :   Handle rape and POCSO Act cases, funded by Nirbhaya Fund


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Contempt of Court is indeed defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971. A Curative Petition serves as the final legal recourse available after a review petition is rejected by the Supreme Court. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences is enshrined in the Constitution and exercised through mercy petitions.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are specifically designed to expedite the handling of rape and POCSO Act cases, with funding provided by the Nirbhaya Fund.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to governance and administration in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Policy                                      Relevant Aspect
1. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts :   Local self-governance provisions
2.  Fiscal Federalism                           :   Centre-State revenue sharing arrangements
3.  Protected Areas (PA) and Restricted Areas     :   Foreigner access regulations (Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963)
4.  Passport Issuance                             :   Central Government's power to issue passports to non-citizens


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts fundamentally altered the structure of local self-governance in India. Fiscal federalism is the core principle governing the distribution of financial resources between the central and state governments. The regulations concerning access to Protected and Restricted Areas for foreigners are clearly defined under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  The Central Government retains the authority to issue passports even to non-citizens in specific circumstances of public interest.  All four pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                 Provision/Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                 :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Sikkim
2. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971               :   Defines civil contempt as willful disobedience to court orders
3.  Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023:  Sets a maximum detention period for undertrials
4. SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989:  Contains provisions for relief and rehabilitation of victims

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas from its purview. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, precisely defines civil contempt as the willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings. The Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, introduces provisions regarding the maximum detention period for undertrial prisoners. Finally, the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, includes provisions for the relief and rehabilitation of victims of atrocities.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of different legislative acts concerning the Indian judicial system and the protection of marginalized communities.  Understanding the specific provisions of each act is crucial for accurate matching.


**2. With reference to the Indian Judicial System, consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court                                 Jurisdiction/Feature
1. Gram Nyayalaya                              :   Settles disputes through conciliation
2. High Court                                   :   Power to punish contempt under Article 215
3. Court of Session                             :   Hears appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases
4. Supreme Court                               :   Curative petition as the last resort

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of the Indian judicial system. Gram Nyayalayas are designed to resolve local disputes using conciliation as a primary method. High Courts possess the power to punish contempt of court, as enshrined in Article 215 of the Constitution.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases are directed to the Court of Session.  Finally, the Supreme Court recognizes the curative petition as the final legal recourse for individuals whose review petitions have been dismissed. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect. This question assesses factual knowledge of the Indian judicial hierarchy and its processes.  The inclusion of diverse court types and their functions tests a comprehensive understanding of the system.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision/Act                            Key Feature/Application
1. Article 72 of the Constitution                :   Governs the President's power on mercy petitions
2. Section 438 of the CrPC                      :   Deals with anticipatory bail provisions
3. Section 18 of the SC/ST Atrocities Act, 1989 :   Restricts anticipatory bail in specific cases
4.  Section 482 of BNSS, 2023                  :   Deals with anticipatory bail


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair presents a correct association. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly outlines the President's powers regarding pardons, reprieves, and commutations of sentences, including mercy petitions. Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) addresses anticipatory bail. Section 18 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, places restrictions on anticipatory bail in cases under the Act.  Section 482 of the BNSS, 2023, also deals with anticipatory bail provisions.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correct pairing.  This question tests knowledge of specific legal provisions and their applications, requiring precise recall of legal codes and constitutional articles.


**4. With reference to Panchayati Raj Institutions, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Initiative                                    Feature/Objective
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                               :   Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans
2. People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)                     :   Launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is a crucial initiative focused on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans.  The People’s Plan Campaign (PPC) was indeed launched under the name ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) has the stated aim of establishing global standards for auditing local governance bodies. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect. The question tests knowledge of government initiatives related to local governance and rural development.  It requires understanding the objectives and features of these programs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Cantonment Feature                            Characteristic/Provision
1.  First Cantonment established                  :   Barrackpore in 1765
2.  Administration of Cantonments              :   Under the Union Government (Union List Entry 3)
3.  Cantonment Board President                 :   Station Commander (ex-officio)
4.  Number of Cantonments in India             :    61


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Barrackpore was the first cantonment established in 1765. The administration of cantonments falls under the Union Government's jurisdiction as per Union List Entry 3. The Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.  There are currently 61 cantonments in India. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual knowledge about the history, administration, and structure of cantonments in India. The question demands precise information on key features of cantonment boards.


**1. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanisms in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Mechanism                                  Key Feature/Agency
1. CPGRAMS                               :   Handles grievances related to service delivery at the state level only.
2.  Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) :  Designs the Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI).
3.  District Magistrate                       :   Designated as District Public Grievance Officer in some, but not all, states.
4.  Sevottam Model                          :   Focuses exclusively on capability building for service delivery, excluding citizen charters and grievance redressal.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because only pair 2 is correctly matched. DARPG is indeed responsible for designing the GRAI, a crucial tool for assessing the effectiveness of grievance redressal mechanisms.

Option (a) is incorrect because CPGRAMS is a central-level online platform connecting citizens to various ministries and departments of the Government of India, and it does not handle grievances at the state level only. It also connects to state-level officers in some cases.

Option (b) is partially correct because while the District Magistrate often serves as the District Public Grievance Officer, this is not universally true across all states.  The statement about the District Magistrate is therefore not entirely accurate.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairings of 1 and 3, as explained above.  Furthermore, the Sevottam model is a comprehensive approach to improving public service delivery that includes citizen charters and grievance redressal mechanisms in addition to capability building.


**2. With reference to the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and their development planning, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept/Initiative                             Feature
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign)  :  Exclusively focuses on the preparation of District Panchayat Development Plans.
2. Panchayat Development Index (PDI)          :   A single-sector index focusing solely on financial performance.
3. Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP)      :   Published exclusively on the e-Gram Swaraj portal after approval.
4.  AuditOnline application                     :  Developed by the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because none of the pairs are entirely accurate.  

Pair 1 is incorrect because Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves the preparation of plans at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).

Pair 2 is incorrect because the PDI is a multi-domain and multi-sectoral index, not limited to a single sector or financial performance.

Pair 3 is correct that the approved GPDP is published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, but the question implies *exclusively* on this portal, which may not be entirely accurate.  Other dissemination methods might be used.

Pair 4 is incorrect because AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.


**3. With reference to Local Body Audits and Governance, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Act                                    Role/Characteristic
1. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to establish local, not global, standards for auditing.
2. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992 :  Do not contain provisions related to local self-governance.
3. Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)  :  Does not exercise control over the auditing of local bodies.
4. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)/Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) : Operates independently of the CAG's technical guidance.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect because iCAL aims to set *global* standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Pair 2 is incorrect because the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 explicitly deal with provisions for local self-governance in India.

Pair 3 is incorrect because the CAG does indeed exercise control and supervision over the proper maintenance of accounts and auditing for all three levels of PRIs/ULBs.

Pair 4 is incorrect because ELFA/DLFA operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG.


**4. With reference to the Aadhaar system and its implications, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature/Aspect                                 Characteristic
1. Aadhaar number                               :   Can be duplicated for a single resident.
2. Aadhaar Act, 2016                              :   Declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2018.
3. Aadhaar metadata                             :  Can be stored indefinitely.
4.  Use of Aadhaar for social welfare schemes :   Mandatory for all citizens, regardless of preference.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Pair 1 is incorrect because Aadhaar numbers are unique; no resident can have a duplicate number.

Pair 2 is incorrect because the Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, in 2018, albeit with certain conditions.

Pair 3 is incorrect because the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.

Pair 4 is incorrect because while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced upon individuals for other purposes like opening bank accounts.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Aspect                                   Feature
1. CSS funding                                  :  Always routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  Funding pattern for core schemes in North Eastern States :  Centre:State ratio of 50:50
3. NITI Aayog's role regarding CSSs              :  Has no role in monitoring or evaluation.
4. Rationalization of CSSs                       : Based on a report from a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers in 2015

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).

Pair 1 is incorrect as all transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.

Pair 2 is incorrect; the Centre:State ratio for core schemes in eight North Eastern States and three Himalayan States is 90:10, not 50:50.

Pair 3 is incorrect as NITI Aayog plays a significant role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Indian Telegraph Act 1885                       :   Repealed by the Telecommunications Act 2023
2. Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933           :   Replaced by the Telecommunications Act 2023
3. Telecommunications Act, 2023                 :   Establishes Digital Bharat Nidhi
4.  Telecommunications Act, 2023                 :   Spectrum allocation primarily through auction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, significantly overhauls the telecommunications regulatory landscape in India.  It explicitly repeals both the outdated Indian Telegraph Act of 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act of 1933, reflecting the technological advancements in the sector.  The Act introduces the Digital Bharat Nidhi, a fund under central government control to support research and development in telecommunications.  Finally, a core element of the act is the shift towards primarily auction-based spectrum allocation, though it retains administrative allocation for specified purposes like national security and disaster management.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                            Responsibility/Function
1. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)         :   Guarantees right to data portability for data principals
2. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)         :   Oversees data breaches and imposes penalties on data fiduciaries
3. Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) :   Hears appeals against DPBI decisions
4. Data Fiduciary                                  :  Responsible for data security and accuracy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The DPBI's core functions include monitoring compliance, imposing penalties for violations, directing actions in case of data breaches, and hearing grievances.  TDSAT is the appellate body for DPBI decisions. Data fiduciaries bear the responsibility of ensuring data accuracy, implementing security measures, and informing relevant parties about breaches.  The right to data portability is not explicitly mentioned among the DPBI's responsibilities in the provided text. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                          Key Feature/Provision
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                               :   Aadhaar is mandatory for all government services
2. Aadhaar Act, 2016                               :   Prohibits private entities from storing Aadhaar data
3. Right to Information Act                         :   Exempts personal information from disclosure
4.  Right to Information Act                        :   Establishes the Central Information Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Aadhaar Act, 2016, while making Aadhaar mandatory for accessing certain government welfare schemes, does not mandate it for all government services.  The Supreme Court ruling clarified that Aadhaar cannot be forced for bank accounts or mobile connections.  The Act, post-Supreme Court judgment,  prohibits the state from entering into contracts with private corporations for sharing Aadhaar data.  The Right to Information Act does exempt certain personal information from disclosure (as amended by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023), and it establishes the Central Information Commission as an oversight body.  Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair or include an incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Scheme/Program                                     Key Feature/Characteristic
1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)               :   Funded solely by the central government
2. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)               :   Implemented by the Central Government
3. Mission Karmayogi                               :   Focuses solely on training IAS officers
4.  Mission Karmayogi                               :   Emphasizes competency-based capacity development


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are jointly funded by the central and state governments and are implemented by state governments, making option 1 and 2 incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi is a broader initiative encompassing all civil servants, not limited to IAS officers, making option 3 incorrect.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift towards competency-based capacity development, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Institution/Body                                  Jurisdiction/Function
1.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):   Audits accounts of only Central Government bodies
2.  Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)     :   Audits only the accounts of state governments
3.  Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)     :   Exercises control over the accounts of Panchayati Raj Institutions
4.  Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)           :    Operates independently of the CAG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, encompassing various levels, not just central government bodies. The CAG's mandate extends to auditing the accounts of both central and state governments, as well as Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).  ELFAs/DLFAs operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not independently. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Constitution                       Provision/Power Related to Mercy Petition
1. Article 72                                       : Grants pardons only for offences against state laws.
2. Article 72                                       :  Applies only to sentences given by civilian courts.
3. Article 142                                      :  Empowers the Supreme Court to issue curative petitions.
4. Article 137                                      :  Deals with the Supreme Court's review power.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., for offenses against both Union and State laws and for sentences given by both court-martials and civilian courts. Article 142 is the basis for the Supreme Court's inherent power to do complete justice, which includes the power to entertain curative petitions (as a last resort). Article 137 relates to the Supreme Court's power to review its own judgments. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.



**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Court                                      Key Feature/Jurisdiction
1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)              :   Exclusively handle cases under the Indian Penal Code
2. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)              :   Funded entirely by state governments
3. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)              :   Aim to expedite the disposal of rape cases.
4. Supreme Court                                   :   Has no power to review its own judgments.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs handle cases related to rape and the POCSO Act, not exclusively IPC cases.  They are centrally sponsored schemes, funded from the Nirbhaya Fund, not solely by state governments. Their primary objective is to ensure swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.  The Supreme Court does have the power to review its own judgments under Article 137. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

    State Category                                  Characteristic/Provision
1. Special Category States (SCS)                   :   Categorization is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution
2. Special Category States (SCS)                   :   Currently receive funding based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
3.  Special Category States (SCS)                   :   Ceased to exist following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission
4. Special Packages to States                     :   Granted only to states with low population density


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution does not explicitly categorize states as SCS; this was a practice based on past Finance Commission recommendations.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula is no longer the basis for funding SCS, as they have been abolished. While special packages are often given to states facing socio-economic challenges, low population density is not the sole criterion. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Body/Institution                 Power/Function
1. President of India                              :   Cannot commute death sentences.
2. President of India                              :   Can pardon individuals convicted by court-martial.
3. Supreme Court                                   :    Cannot quash arbitral awards.
4. Supreme Court                                   :   Can issue curative petitions.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The President of India has the power to commute death sentences under Article 72.  The President can grant pardons to individuals convicted by court-martial. The Supreme Court can quash arbitral awards if they are found to be contrary to law or public policy. The power to issue curative petitions is a Supreme Court's inherent power. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they include incorrectly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article              Subject Matter
1. Article 270                         :   Distribution of taxes between Union and States based on Finance Commission recommendations.
2. Article 275                         :   Grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to States.
3. Article 280                         :   Establishment of the Finance Commission.
4. Article 292                         :   Union government's power to borrow money within or outside the country.
5. Article 293                         :   State government's power to borrow money within India.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 explicitly deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States, as recommended by the Finance Commission. Article 275 empowers the Union to grant financial assistance to States that are in need of such assistance. The establishment of the Finance Commission is enshrined in Article 280, a crucial body for adjudicating the sharing of resources between the Union and the States. Article 292 grants the Union the power to borrow money both within and outside India, while Article 293 restricts State borrowing to within India, reflecting the hierarchical fiscal structure of the Indian federation.  Any option excluding even one of these articles would be incorrect, highlighting the integral role each plays in India's fiscal federalism.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Concept       Description
1. Vertical Devolution                 :   Distribution of funds among different levels of government.
2. Horizontal Devolution               :   Distribution of funds among states based on various criteria.
3. Grants-in-Aid                       :   Financial assistance provided by the Centre to States under Article 275.
4. Debt-GDP ratio of states            :   Indicator of state financial health, stood at 27.5% in March 2023.
5. Special Category Status (SCS)      :   Classification given to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, ceased to exist on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and States, a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism. Horizontal devolution focuses on the distribution of funds among the states themselves based on various criteria like income distance, population, and geographical factors.  Grants-in-aid, as per Article 275, are crucial for assisting states with specific needs. The debt-GDP ratio of states provides a crucial measure of their financial health, and the given figure is accurate as per the provided information.  The Special Category Status (SCS), while previously granted to certain states, was discontinued following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.  Therefore, all statements accurately reflect the given facts.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                    Key Feature
1. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA)    :   Requires prior permission to receive foreign funds, with mandatory Aadhaar submission by office-bearers of NGOs.
2. Post Office Act, 2023                           :   Repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998, and appoints a Director General of Postal Services (DGPS).
3. 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts   :   Contain provisions on local self-governance.
4.  Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993   :   Established the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC).
5.  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996       :   Governs domestic arbitration, amended in 2015, 2019, and 2021.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key feature of the respective Act or Amendment. The FCRA, as amended, mandates prior permission and Aadhaar submission for receiving foreign funds. The Post Office Act, 2023, indeed replaces the 1998 Act and introduces the DGPS. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments are foundational to local self-governance in India.  The PHRA, 1993, established the NHRC.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, governs domestic arbitration and has undergone multiple amendments as stated.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question is designed to test detailed knowledge of various acts and their key provisions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Body/Initiative                    Description
1. Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) :   Handles grievances related to service delivery in the Union Government.
2. CPGRAMS                                         :   Online platform for lodging grievances with public authorities.
3. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) :   Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
4. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign)     :   Aims to accelerate people’s participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans.
5.  Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM)           :   An important instrument to measure the effectiveness of an organization.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The DARPG plays a significant role in grievance redressal within the Union Government. CPGRAMS is a crucial online platform facilitating citizen engagement in grievance redressal.  The iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on enhancing people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan formulation.  Finally, the GRM is a key performance indicator for assessing organizational effectiveness.  Each pair accurately describes the function and role of the named entity, making option (d) the only correct answer. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various governance initiatives and their objectives.


**1. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Institution                                    Key Feature
    1. Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) : Established under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
    2. New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019 :  Facilitates international commercial arbitration
    3. Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021 : Allows for conditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards in cases of fraud.
    4. Indian Council of Arbitration                     : Registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was constituted by the Supreme Court of India in 2005, not under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, aims to facilitate institutional arbitration, primarily focusing on domestic disputes, although it can involve international elements if the parties agree.  Thus, pair 2 is partially inaccurate in its description. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an *unconditional* stay of enforcement of arbitral awards obtained through fraud or corruption, making pair 3 incorrect. The Indian Council of Arbitration is indeed a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, making pair 4 correct.  Hence, only pair 4 is entirely accurate.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between nuanced details within legal frameworks.


**2. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following pairs:**

    Constitutional Provision/Institution          Specific Function/Characteristic
    1. Article 270                               :  Taxes levied and collected by states and distributed between union and states
    2. 15th Finance Commission                   : Recommended a 50% share of divisible pool for states
    3. Article 293                               : States can borrow money both within and outside India
    4. Horizontal Devolution                      : Distribution among states based solely on population (2011 Census)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, not the states.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, not 50%. Article 293 restricts state borrowing to within India; they cannot borrow internationally. Horizontal devolution considers several factors beyond just the 2011 population census, including income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  All pairs contain inaccuracies, demonstrating a need for precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and fiscal policies.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify incorrect information.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

    State/Entity                                   Relevant Detail
    1. Fifth Finance Commission                    : Recommended abolishing the SCS concept
    2. 14th Finance Commission                    : Recommended the continuation of SCS based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula
    3. Andhra Pradesh                             :  Currently enjoys Special Category Status
    4. Article 371                                : Contains provisions for special provisions to states, irrespective of SCS


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fifth Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS, not its abolishment. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the cessation of SCS, ending the special funding pattern based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  Andhra Pradesh does not currently enjoy Special Category Status. Article 371 does indeed contain provisions for special provisions to certain states, independent of the SCS classification. Therefore, only pair 4 is accurately matched. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills to identify misleading information related to the history and current status of SCS.


**4. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following pairs:**

    Amendment/Provision                          Specific Detail
    1. 2020 FCRA Amendment                        : Permits NGOs to receive foreign funds without registration
    2. FCRA Account                               : Can be used for purposes other than those specified for the received funds
    3. Validity of FCRA Registration              : Is for a period of two years
    4. Maximum Limit for Administrative Expenses :  20% of the received foreign contribution


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 2020 FCRA amendment mandates prior permission and registration for receiving foreign funds, making pair 1 incorrect.  The FCRA account is strictly designated for foreign contributions and cannot be used for other purposes. The validity of FCRA registration is for five years, not two.  Only the statement regarding the maximum limit for administrative expenses (20%) is correct.  The question tests knowledge of the FCRA, its amendments, and its provisions, emphasizing the ability to identify discrepancies and factual inaccuracies.  It assesses factual recall and analytical skills.


**5. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

    Provision/Entity                                    Feature/Power
    1. India Post Office Act, 1998                     : Remains in effect alongside the 2023 Act
    2. Director General of Postal Services (DGPS)       :  Lacks the power to make regulations on postal charges
    3. Government's Power to Intercept Postal Articles : Limited to reasons of national security and public safety
    4. Post Office Liability                            :  Completely exempt from liability for any service provided


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Post Office Act, 2023, repeals the 1998 Act. The DGPS has the power to make regulations on postal charges. The government's power to intercept postal articles extends beyond the specified reasons, including public order and emergency situations.  The Post Office is not completely exempt from liability; it is liable for services as prescribed. Therefore, all pairs are incorrect, testing the candidate's understanding of the new Post Office Act and its implications. This question emphasizes factual recall and analytical skills in evaluating the accuracy of statements about a recent legislative change.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision                                   Key Feature
1. Article 72                                      :   Empowers the President to commute death sentences
2. Article 137                                     :   Relates to the Supreme Court's review jurisdiction
3. Article 142                                     :   Provides the Supreme Court power to do complete justice
4. 10th Schedule                                  :   Deals with anti-defection law
5.  Section 8 of RTI Act                           :   Specifies exemptions from information disclosure

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes the power to commute a death sentence. Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. This is a crucial aspect of the judicial review process, ensuring the Supreme Court can correct any errors or inconsistencies in its decisions.  Article 142 of the Constitution vests the Supreme Court with the power to do complete justice in any case before it, and this power is often invoked to ensure that the ends of justice are served. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution, added through the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985, introduced the anti-defection law, which aims to prevent legislators from changing their party affiliations for personal gain. Section 8 of the Right to Information Act, 2005, details specific exemptions from the right to information, safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining national security. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting one or more correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                      Implementing Body/Source of Funds
1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)            :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2. People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan) :   Ministry of Rural Development
3.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :    Department of Justice
4.  Common Service Centres (CSC) Scheme       :    Ministry of Electronics & IT

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) are a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.  The People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan) falls under the purview of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, is a legislation enacted by the Parliament and implemented by the government. Common Service Centres (CSCs) are overseen by the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Concept                                  Associated Legal Provision/Remedy
1. Mercy Petition                               :   Article 142
2. Curative Petition                            :   Article 137
3.  Proportional Representation                  :   52nd Amendment Act
4.  Right to Privacy                             :   Article 21
5.  Preventive Detention                        :   Article 22


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Mercy petitions are addressed to the President under Article 72, not Article 142.  Curative petitions, the last legal recourse in the Supreme Court, are based on the Supreme Court's inherent powers under Article 142, not Article 137 (which concerns review petitions).  Proportional representation is not directly related to the 52nd Amendment Act (which dealt with anti-defection).  The right to privacy, although not explicitly mentioned, is now considered a fundamental right under Article 21.  Preventive detention is addressed under Article 22 of the Constitution.  Therefore, only four pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation                                    Subject Matter
1. Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023          :   Replaces the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973
2. Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023   :   Replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872
3.  Mediation Act, 2023                         :   Promotes Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
4.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Regulates the processing of digital personal data


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, not the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.  The Mediation Act, 2023, aims to promote mediation as a preferred mode of ADR. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, regulates the processing of digital personal data. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain incorrect pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                Function/Responsibility
1. Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)          :   Handles appeals against its decisions
2. Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT):  Oversees implementation of CSC scheme
3.  Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI)  :   Issues Aadhaar cards
4.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF)              :   Publishes World Press Freedom Index (WPFI)
5.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):  Sets global standards for auditing local governance bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is responsible for monitoring compliance, imposing penalties, and directing data fiduciaries to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach.  Appeals against its decisions go to the appropriate appellate body, not the DPBI itself.  The Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) handles disputes related to telecommunications, not the implementation of the CSC scheme.  UIDAI is correctly paired with its function of issuing Aadhaar cards. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) correctly publishes the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI). The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  Therefore, only pairs 1,3,4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) contain incorrect pairings.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                Provision Related To
1. Article 72                             :   President's power to pardon death sentences
2. Article 137                            :   Supreme Court's power of review
3. Article 142                            :   Supreme Court's power to do complete justice
4. Article 280                            :   Establishment of the Finance Commission
5. Article 292                            :   Union government's borrowing powers

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 explicitly grants the President of India the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences, including death sentences.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. Article 142 allows the Supreme Court to pass orders necessary for doing complete justice.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States. Article 292 outlines the Union government's power to borrow money within or outside India.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all the pairs is the correct answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Government Scheme/Institution             Primary Focus Area
1. Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)       :   Efficient handling of POCSO Act cases
2. Nirbhaya Fund                            :   Funding for FTSCs
3. Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice : Implementation of FTSCs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  FTSCs are specifically designed to expedite the disposal of rape cases and those falling under the POCSO Act, making option 1 correct. The central government funds FTSCs through the Nirbhaya Fund, establishing the accuracy of pair 2.  The Department of Justice, under the Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for the implementation of the FTSCs program, validating pair 3. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as it accurately reflects the relationships between the schemes/institutions and their primary focus areas.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading information in the provided pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Concept             Description
1. Vertical Devolution                    :   Distribution among states based on criteria like income distance
2. Horizontal Devolution                   :   States' share from the divisible pool of taxes
3. Grants-in-Aid                           :   Provided by the Centre to states under Article 275
4. Article 293                            :   States' borrowing powers within India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Grants-in-aid are indeed provided by the central government to states as per Article 275 of the Constitution.  Article 293 correctly describes the limitations on state borrowing powers within India.  However, the descriptions for vertical and horizontal devolution are reversed. Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool, while horizontal devolution refers to the distribution among states based on various criteria. Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer, isolating the accurately matched pairs.  The other options incorrectly include pairs with swapped definitions or incorrect constitutional references.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Act                      Specific Function/Power
1. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Addresses grievances related to scheduled castes
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :   Conducts civil services examinations
3. State Finance Commission              :   Advises on the distribution of financial resources within a state
4. Central Vigilance Commission (CVC)  :   Deals with corruption in government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The NCSC is responsible for addressing the grievances and safeguarding the rights of Scheduled Castes. The UPSC conducts the civil services examinations for recruitment to various government positions. State Finance Commissions play a crucial role in advising state governments on the allocation of financial resources.  The CVC is the primary anti-corruption body within the central government. Thus, option (d), which includes all the accurately matched pairs, is the correct answer. There are no errors or misleading elements in the given pairings.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                  Key Feature
1. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005    :   Provides citizens with access to information held by public authorities
2. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885          :   Governs the regulation of telecommunication services
3. Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017 :  Provides for temporary internet shutdowns
4. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act  :   Regulates the acceptance of foreign funds by NGOs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The RTI Act, 2005, is designed to ensure transparency and accountability by granting citizens the right to access information held by public authorities. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, forms the basis for regulating telecommunication services in India. The 2017 Rules provide the framework for temporarily suspending telecom services, including internet shutdowns, under specific circumstances. The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act governs how NGOs receive and utilize foreign funding. Option (d), therefore, accurately reflects the correct matching of each Act/Law with its key feature.  No pair contains inaccurate or misleading information.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Petition                 Court/Authority
1. Mercy Petition                   :   Supreme Court
2. Curative Petition                 :   Supreme Court
3. Review Petition                   :   Supreme Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Curative petitions and review petitions are both avenues for legal recourse within the Supreme Court.  A curative petition is the final legal remedy available when a review petition has been dismissed. A review petition is a mechanism for a party to seek reconsideration of a Supreme Court judgment. However, mercy petitions are addressed to the President of India, not the Supreme Court.  Therefore, option (b) is correct, as it correctly identifies the courts associated with curative and review petitions. Option (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the Supreme Court as the authority for mercy petitions.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Protected Area Status                 Location
1.  Entirely Protected Area                :   Arunachal Pradesh
2. Partly Protected, Partly Restricted Area:   Sikkim
3. Entirely Restricted Area               :   Andaman & Nicobar Islands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under relevant regulations. Sikkim has a combination of both Protected and Restricted areas.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are classified as entirely Restricted Areas. Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the geographical classifications of these areas.  No inaccuracies or misleading information is present in the pairings.  The options are designed to test precise knowledge of the geographical designations.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

     Passport Type                        Colour
1. Ordinary Passport                     :   White
2. Diplomatic Passport                   :   Maroon
3. Official Passport                      :   Blue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The colours of Indian passports are as follows: Ordinary passports are blue, Diplomatic passports are white, and Official passports are maroon. The question deliberately reverses the colours to test the applicant's precise knowledge.  All options are carefully constructed to be plausible distractors, making simple guessing unlikely.  The correct answer highlights the importance of accurate factual recall in this context.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article           Provision Related To
1. Article 72                     :   Power of the President to grant pardons in cases of death sentence
2. Article 137                    :   Review petition in the Supreme Court
3. Article 142                    :   Power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice
4. Article 32                     :   Right to Constitutional Remedies (Supreme Court)
5. Article 226                    :   Power of High Courts to issue writs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, including death sentences.  Article 137 empowers the Supreme Court to review its own judgments. Article 142 is a crucial provision that allows the Supreme Court to pass any order necessary for doing complete justice in any case before it, including issuing directions or writs. Article 32 guarantees the right to constitutional remedies, allowing citizens to approach the Supreme Court for enforcement of fundamental rights.  Article 226 similarly empowers High Courts to issue writs for the enforcement of fundamental rights and other legal rights.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Pair 2 is incorrectly linked to Article 137 as this is about the Supreme Court's power of review, not related to the President's powers.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Scheme                                   Key Feature
1.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)      :   Launched in 2019 under Nirbhaya Fund
2.  Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 :   Establishes Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)
3.  Right to Information Act, 2005           :   Exempts personal information from disclosure (as amended)
4.  Indian Evidence Act, 1872                 :   Replaced by Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023
5.  Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973  :   Mandates forensic investigation for offences with at least seven years imprisonment

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs were indeed launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme funded by the Nirbhaya Fund. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, established the DPBI to oversee data protection. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, was replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023. The CrPC, 1973, mandates forensic investigation for serious offences.  However, the RTI Act's exemption of personal information is a result of amendments made post-2005, specifically by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023. Therefore, while the RTI Act itself is correctly paired, the specific feature mentioned is not entirely accurate in its original 2005 form.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body/Organization                         Characteristic/Function
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):   Accredited by GANHRI with 'A' status
2. Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI): Issues Aadhaar cards, a unique 12-digit identification number
3.  Common Service Centres (CSC) SPV       :   Operates under Ministry of Electronics & IT
4. Reporters Without Borders (RSF)          :   Publishes World Press Freedom Index (WPFI)
5.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NHRC's accreditation history with GANHRI, UIDAI's function in issuing Aadhaar, CSC SPV's operation under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, RSF's publication of WPFI, and iCAL's aim to set global standards for auditing are all accurately described.  While the NHRC's 'A' status might have been temporarily deferred, its initial and subsequent attainment of this status is a verifiable fact.  All the pairs accurately reflect the functions and characteristics of the mentioned bodies.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Provision/Act                         Feature/Consequence
1.  Mercy Petition                             :   Power vested in the President under Article 72
2. Curative Petition                           :   Last constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal
3.  Right to be Forgotten (RTBF)              :   Explicitly mentioned in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023
4.  Inner Line Permit (ILP)                    :   Used to regulate movement in protected areas in Northeast India
5.  Protected Area Permit (PAP)/Restricted Area Permit (RAP):  Applicable to NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The President's power to consider mercy petitions is enshrined in Article 72. A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court. The ILP system is used to regulate movement in protected areas in Northeast India. However, the Right to be Forgotten is not explicitly mentioned in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023; it's a concept derived from European GDPR but not directly codified in Indian law.  PAP/RAP is not applicable to NRIs, PIO card holders and OCI holders;  they are required to apply for it whereas Indian citizens in these areas require an ILP.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  Government Body/Scheme                   Implementation Detail
1.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan                      :   Launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018
2.  AuditOnline application                  :   Developed by Ministry of Panchayati Raj for online audit of panchayat accounts
3.  Cantonment Boards                       :   Land portions merged with state local bodies
4.  Post Office Department                   :   Powers to intercept postal articles on specified grounds
5.  National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)       :   Includes Common Service Centres (CSCs) as one of its three pillars

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was indeed launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  AuditOnline is a Ministry of Panchayati Raj initiative for online auditing of panchayat accounts.  The merging of land portions from Cantonment Boards with state local bodies is a recent development.  The Post Office Department has the power to intercept postal articles under specific circumstances.  The NeGP included CSCs as one of its three pillars. All pairs accurately reflect the details of the given government bodies and schemes.


**1. With reference to the Indian Constitution's provisions on Centre-State financial relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Feature
1. Article 270                                   :   Taxes levied and collected by the Union are distributed between the Union and States based on Finance Commission recommendations.
2. Article 280                                   :   Establishes the Finance Commission to adjudicate the sharing of resources between the Union and the States.
3. Article 293                                   :   States can borrow money from sources within India, but not outside India, without prior Union consent if indebted to the Union.
4.  Article 275                                  : Grants-in-aid are provided by the Centre to states.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on this distribution and other related matters. Article 293 outlines the borrowing powers of states, with restrictions placed if they are indebted to the Union. Article 275 empowers the Centre to provide grants-in-aid to states. These provisions are integral to India's fiscal federalism, outlining the mechanisms for sharing resources and responsibilities between the Union and States.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Council Type                                Feature
1. Autonomous District Councils (ADCs)         :   Consist of a maximum of 30 members, with 4 nominated by the Governor and 26 elected.
2. Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs)        :   Have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management and land revenue collection.
3. Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs)             :   Operate in areas covered by the Fifth Schedule.
4.  Sixth Schedule Areas                       :   Include the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. ADCs, as per the Sixth Schedule, have a structure with a maximum of 30 members, including nominated and elected representatives.  ARCs and ADCs possess significant legislative and executive powers, including those related to forest management and land revenue.  TACs are indeed associated with the Fifth Schedule, not the Sixth.  Option 4 is incorrect because while parts of Arunachal Pradesh are in Sixth Schedule areas, the entire state is not.  Options (a), (b), and (c)  incorrectly omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following pairs:**

   State                                        Characteristic
1. Andhra Pradesh                               :   Currently holds Special Category Status.
2. Bihar                                        :   Has demanded Special Category Status.
3. Jammu & Kashmir (pre-reorganisation)       :   Was granted Special Category Status in 1969.
4.  Gadgil-Mukherjee formula                   :   Determined grants for SCS states before the 14th Finance Commission.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. J&K, Assam, and Nagaland were indeed granted SCS in 1969. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine the grants given to these states before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, which effectively ended the SCS designation.  Andhra Pradesh does not currently hold SCS, and while Bihar has demanded it, it hasn't been granted.   Options (a), (b), and (d)  include incorrectly matched pairs.



**4. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Commission/Committee                         Recommendation
1. Fazl Ali Commission                            :   Recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories.
2. S.K. Dhar Commission                         :   Primarily based reorganization on linguistic factors.
3. JVP Committee                                 :   Rejected language as the primary basis for state reorganization.
4.  Article 3 of the Constitution                 :   Empowers Parliament to form new states through ordinary legislation with a simple majority.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Fazl Ali Commission's recommendations, implemented through the 7th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1956, significantly reshaped the Indian states' map. The JVP Committee indeed rejected language as the sole criterion for reorganization.  Article 3 of the Constitution grants Parliament the power to create new states. The S.K. Dhar Commission prioritized administrative convenience over linguistic factors, making option 2 incorrect. Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                         Detail
1. Headquarters                                  :   Mumbai
2. Establishment Act                             :   Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (as amended)
3. Appointment of Chairperson and Members      :   By the President of India based on a committee's recommendations.
4.  Removal from Office                         :   By the President based on consultation with the Election Commission.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The NHRC is established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (as amended).  The President appoints the Chairperson and members based on a committee's recommendations. However, the NHRC's headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai (making option 1 incorrect).  The President removes the Chairperson and members after consultation with the Supreme Court, not the Election Commission (making option 4 incorrect). Options (a), (c), and (d) therefore include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**6.  With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Cantonment Feature                           Detail
1.  Administrative Control                     :   Ministry of Home Affairs
2.  Governing Act                               :   Cantonments Act, 2006
3.  First Cantonment Established                 :   Barrackpore in 1765
4.  Number of Cantonments in India (approx.)   :   50


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, and Barrackpore was indeed the first cantonment, established in 1765. However, the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, has administrative control over cantonments (making option 1 incorrect). There are approximately 61 cantonments in India, not 50 (making option 4 incorrect). Options (a), (c), and (d) thus include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**7. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Detail
1.  Enactment Year                              :   2002
2.  Replaced Act                               :   Freedom of Information Act, 2002
3.  Coordinating Agency                         :   Department of Personnel and Training
4.  Legal Basis for RTI (as per Supreme Court) :   Article 19


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the implementation of the RTI Act, and the Supreme Court has linked the right to information to Article 19 (right to freedom of speech and expression). However, the RTI Act was enacted in 2005, not 2002 (making option 1 incorrect), and while it did replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, the year is not 2002 but 2005 (making option 2 incorrect). Options (a), (b), and (d) therefore contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**8. With reference to the  Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues and fundamental rights, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                    Interpretation in Recent Judgement
1. Article 14                                  :   Guarantees the right to a clean environment.
2. Article 21                                  :   Includes the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.
3. Article 19                                  :   Related to the right to protest against environmental degradation.
4.  Writ Petition Name                         :   'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others'


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. A recent Supreme Court judgment did indeed interpret Article 21 to encompass the right to be free from adverse climate change effects. The case name is correctly cited in pair 4. However, while Article 14 relates to equality and Article 19 to freedoms, the specific interpretations mentioned in pairs 1 and 3 regarding the environment are not the primary focus of the referenced judgment; the linkage is indirect and not explicitly established in this specific context (making options 1 and 3 incorrect). Options (a), (c), and (d) therefore include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Article of the Indian Constitution          Subject Matter
1. Article 270                               :   Levy and collection of taxes by the Union and distribution between Union and States
2. Article 275                               :   Grants-in-aid to states
3. Article 292                               :   Borrowing powers of the Union government
4. Article 280                               :   Establishment of Finance Commission
5. Article 246                               :   Allocation of tax powers between the Union and States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States. Article 275 mandates the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states. Article 292 outlines the borrowing powers of the Union. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission. Article 246 clearly delineates the powers of the Union and States to levy and collect taxes, forming the bedrock of India's fiscal federalism.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Understanding these articles is crucial for analyzing India's fiscal federalism and center-state relations, a key area in the UPSC examination.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Finance Commission Recommendation      Specific Aspect Addressed
1. 15th Finance Commission                 :   Vertical devolution of 41% of divisible pool to states
2. 14th Finance Commission                 :   Abolition of Special Category Status
3. 5th Finance Commission                  :   Introduction of Special Category Status
4. Gadgil-Mukherjee Formula               :   Grant allocation to Special Category States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of the Special Category Status (SCS). The 5th Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the basis for allocating grants to states with special category status.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Other options incorrectly omit one or more of these accurate pairings, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of the historical evolution and current structure of fiscal federalism in India.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision             Specific Provision Related to Fiscal Federalism
1. Article 282                           :   Discretionary grants by the Centre or States
2. Article 269-A                         :   Levy and collection of GST in interstate trade
3. Seventh Schedule                      :   Allocation of tax bases between Union and States
4. Article 269                           :   Taxes levied and collected by Centre but wholly assigned to States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Article 282 empowers the central and state governments to make grants for any public purpose. Article 269A deals with the distribution of GST revenue collected from interstate trade. The Seventh Schedule outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and States. Article 269 outlines taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to the States.  A comprehensive understanding of these articles is essential for grasping the intricacies of India's fiscal federal system.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. It empowers the Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
3.  ADCs have a maximum of 30 members, with 4 nominated by the Governor and 26 elected.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), is a direct outcome of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. It grants the Governor the power to establish ADCs and ARCs in specified states. ADCs are constituted with a maximum of 30 members, comprising 4 nominated by the Governor and 26 elected members.  These provisions are designed to grant autonomy to tribal regions, a crucial aspect of India's governance structure.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs related to the formation of new states in India:**

   Constitutional Provision         Specific Power or Procedure
1. Article 3                          :   Formation of new states and alteration of boundaries
2. Presidential Recommendation   :   Required for introduction of a bill for state formation in Parliament
3. State Reorganisation Commission:  Currently the primary body for recommending new state formation



Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution deals with the formation of new states and the alteration of areas, boundaries, or names of existing states.  A bill for the formation of a new state must be introduced in Parliament only on the recommendation of the President. While State Reorganisation Commissions have been used historically, they are not the *currently* primary body for recommending new state formations. The process is now more directly under the purview of the Parliament and the executive branch. Therefore, option (b) is the only correct answer.  Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because they include the inaccurate pairing related to the State Reorganisation Commission.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   State                                      Status under Protected/Restricted Area Orders
1. Arunachal Pradesh                        : Entirely a Protected Area
2. Jammu & Kashmir                         : Partially a Restricted Area
3. Sikkim                                   : Entirely a Restricted Area
4. Andaman & Nicobar Islands              : Partially a Protected Area

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the relevant orders.  Jammu & Kashmir has parts designated as Protected or Restricted Areas, but not the entire state. Sikkim is partially a Protected Area and partially a Restricted Area, making options (c) and (d) incorrect. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as a Restricted Area, not partially a Protected Area. The question tests factual recall regarding the specific status of different states concerning Protected and Restricted Area classifications under Indian law.  Understanding the nuances of these classifications is crucial for comprehending the governance framework related to access control in sensitive regions.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge, highlighting the importance of accurate information recall rather than general understanding.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                  Provision Related to Fiscal Federalism
1. Article 246                             : Defines tax bases between Union and States
2. Article 269-A                           : Levy and Collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST) within states
3. Article 270                             : Distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union among states
4. Article 280                             : Establishes the Finance Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 246 clearly delineates the tax powers between the Union and State governments, forming the foundation of India's fiscal federalism. Article 270 deals with the distribution of tax revenues collected by the Union among the states, a key aspect of revenue sharing.  Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission, crucial for recommending the distribution of resources.  However, Article 269-A pertains to the levy and collection of GST in interstate trade or commerce, not solely within states.  The question assesses the candidates’ understanding of the constitutional provisions underpinning fiscal federalism in India.  The inclusion of Article 269-A as a distractor tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the article's scope, differentiating between inter-state and intra-state GST.  The correct answer emphasizes the core articles defining revenue sharing and the institutional framework involved.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Order                                  Key Feature
1. Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963 :  Regulates entry into Protected Areas
2. Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958 : Defines areas between the inner line and international border as Protected Areas
3. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986  :  Specifically addresses air pollution control

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, and the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, are correctly matched with their respective features regarding the regulation of entry into specific areas. The Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, provides a broader framework for environmental protection, not specifically focusing solely on air pollution control.  This question tests knowledge of specific legislation and their application in the context of governance and access control in India.  The inclusion of the Environment (Protection) Act as a distractor highlights the need for candidates to distinguish between broad environmental regulations and more specific acts dealing with entry into protected/restricted areas. The question assesses the ability to recall and differentiate between related but distinct legal instruments.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Primary Function
1. Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)     :  Handles cases related to financial crimes
2. Common Service Centres (CSC) SPV        :  Oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme
3. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  Addresses grievances related to Scheduled Castes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The CBI investigates a wide range of offenses, including financial crimes. The CSC SPV is responsible for implementing the Common Service Centres scheme, and the NCSC addresses grievances and welfare issues related to Scheduled Castes.  The question tests the understanding of the roles and responsibilities of various Indian government organizations.  There are no incorrect pairings, making all options except (c) incorrect. This question emphasizes the importance of understanding the functions of key institutions within the Indian governance structure.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Legal Remedy                                 Relevant Constitutional Article/Provision
1. Mercy Petition                              : Article 72 (Presidential power of pardon)
2. Curative Petition                           : Article 142 (Supreme Court's power to do complete justice)
3.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)        : Nirbhaya Fund (funding source)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 grants the President the power to grant pardons, including for death sentences, thus covering mercy petitions. Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to ensure complete justice, forming the basis for curative petitions.  The FTSCs are indeed funded through the Nirbhaya Fund.  This question evaluates the understanding of legal remedies available within the Indian judicial system and their constitutional basis.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes the distractor options ineffective, reinforcing the importance of precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and legal mechanisms.  The question assesses the candidate's ability to link legal processes with their constitutional underpinnings.



**1. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                      Description
1. Section 8                                    :   Specifies exemptions from information disclosure
2. Second Schedule                               :   Lists certain intelligence and security organizations exempt from RTI
3. RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019                    :   Granted the Central Government power to determine the terms of service for CICs and ICs
4. Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 :   Amended Section 8(1)(j) to exempt all personal information from disclosure


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act, 2005, aims to empower citizens by providing them with access to information held by public authorities.  However, certain categories of information are exempt from disclosure to protect national security,  privacy, and other vital interests. Section 8 of the Act explicitly outlines these exemptions. The Second Schedule further specifies certain intelligence and security organizations that are exempted from the ambit of the RTI Act.  The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, significantly altered the process of appointing and managing Information Commissioners (ICs) at both the central and state levels, granting the central government greater control over their terms and conditions of service.  The DPDP Act, 2023, introduced a crucial amendment to Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, broadening the scope of exempted personal information.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                                     Description
1. 12-digit unique identification number     :   Can be deactivated or omitted by UIDAI
2. Issued by UIDAI                             :   Serves as authoritative proof of date of birth
3. Linked to individual biometrics             :   Guarantees no resident can have a duplicate number


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar, a 12-digit unique identification number, is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).  A crucial feature is its linkage to individual biometrics, ensuring uniqueness and preventing duplication. The UIDAI retains the power to deactivate or omit Aadhaar numbers under specific circumstances. However, it's crucial to note that while Aadhaar can be used to establish identity, the Supreme Court has clarified that it is not considered authoritative proof of date of birth.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrect because Aadhaar doesn't serve as definitive proof of date of birth. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 2 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                     Feature
1. Admissibility of electronic records          :   Carries the same legal weight as paper records
2. Oral evidence                               :   Can only be given in person before the court
3. Joint trials                                 :   Applies only to offences with a maximum sentence of less than seven years


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, modernizes India's evidence law. A key provision is the equal admissibility of electronic and digital records alongside paper records, enhancing the use of digital evidence in legal proceedings.  However, the Act also allows for oral evidence to be given electronically, contradicting option 2.  Joint trials are permitted under the Act for multiple accused individuals, but this feature isn't limited to offences with sentences below seven years, making option 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pairs 2 and/or 3.


**4. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Right                                  Description
1. Data Principal                               :   Has the right to seek correction and erasure of personal data
2. Data Fiduciary                              :   Must erase personal data as soon as the purpose is met
3. Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)          :   Are not subject to any data protection obligations
4. Cross-border data transfer                   :   Is permitted only to countries specified by the government


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The DPDP Act, 2023, establishes a framework for protecting digital personal data. Data principals, individuals whose data is being processed, possess several rights, including the right to seek correction or erasure of their data. Data fiduciaries, entities processing personal data, have obligations such as ensuring data accuracy and erasing data when its purpose is fulfilled unless legally required for retention.  The Act designates certain data fiduciaries as Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) based on factors like data volume and sensitivity, but these entities are *not* exempt from data protection obligations; rather, they face additional responsibilities.  Cross-border data transfer is permitted, but only to countries approved by the government. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 3 is incorrect. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**5. With reference to the President's powers concerning mercy petitions, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                     Power Granted
1. Article 72                                  :   Applies only to offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power
2. Article 72                                  :   Includes the power to pardon individuals convicted by court-martial
3. Article 142                                 :   Provides the basis for the curative petition process


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, including commutation or suspension of sentences. This power extends to cases involving convictions by court-martial and offenses under laws where the Union's executive power applies.  While Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, it's not directly related to the President's mercy petition powers; the curative petition process is a separate Supreme Court mechanism. Therefore, pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, while pair 3 is incorrect. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**6. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                      Feature
1. Establishment                               :   Established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993
2. Accreditation                               :   Currently holds an 'A' status accreditation from GANHRI
3. Headquarters                               :   Located in Mumbai


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  Its headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  The NHRC's accreditation status with the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has faced recent deferrals due to concerns about diversity and protection of marginalized groups,  meaning it does not currently hold an 'A' status.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs 2 and/or 3.


**7. With reference to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, consider the following pairs:**

   Amendment/Provision                         Focus
1. Post-1860 amendments                       :   Primarily addressed offenses against women and food adulteration
2. Definition of organized crime               :   Includes cybercrime and land grabbing
3. Murder or grievous hurt by a group         :   Mandatory death penalty for all members involved


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, has undergone numerous amendments since its enactment.  Many of these amendments have focused on addressing issues such as offenses against women and food adulteration.  The IPC also defines organized crime broadly, encompassing various activities including cybercrime and land grabbing. However, the punishment for murder or grievous hurt by a group, while severe, doesn't automatically mandate the death penalty for all members; the sentencing considers the specific circumstances and roles of each individual. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (c), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**8. With reference to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), consider the following pairs:**

   Provision                                   Feature
1. Detention of undertrials                    :   Mandatory release on bail after completing one-third of the maximum sentence for first-time offenders
2. Medical examination                         :   Can only be requested by a senior police officer
3. Forensic investigation                       :   Mandatory for offences punishable by less than seven years imprisonment


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BNSS, 2023, which replaces the CrPC, 1973, introduces several procedural changes.  It mandates the release of first-time offenders on bail after they have served one-third of their maximum sentence.  However, this provision has exceptions for certain serious offenses.  Any police officer, not just a senior one, can request a medical examination of an accused in specific cases.  Forensic investigations are mandatory for offences punishable with at least seven years, not less than seven years, of imprisonment. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrectly matched pairs 2 and/or 3.


**9. With reference to preventive detention, consider the following pairs:**

   Law                                          Grounds for Detention
1. National Security Act, 1980                 :   Maintenance of essential services
2. Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act (COFEPOSA), 1974 :   Security of the State
3. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Maintenance of Public Order


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Preventive detention laws allow for the detention of individuals without trial to prevent them from engaging in activities deemed harmful to national security or public order.  The National Security Act, 1980, COFEPOSA, 1974, and UAPA, 1967, all provide for preventive detention based on grounds such as the security of the state, maintenance of public order, and maintenance of essential services. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.


**10. With reference to personality rights, consider the following pairs:**

   Aspect                                       Feature
1. Protection in Indian Statute                 :   Explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution
2. Posthumous Personality Rights             :   Cannot be claimed by family members
3. International Conventions                   :   A comprehensive international treaty exists on the subject


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Personality rights, encompassing the right to protect one's name, image, and other identifying features, are not explicitly mentioned in any specific Indian statute. While they are often linked to the right to privacy and property, there is no single comprehensive statutory protection.  Posthumous personality rights can be claimed by family members, particularly in defamation suits.  There is no single, universally ratified international convention specifically dedicated to personality rights. Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Body                                  Associated Act/Amendment
1. National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) : Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993
2. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC) :  The Constitution of India
3.  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) :  The Constitution of India
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act (PHRA), 1993, as amended in 2006 and 2019.  This act defines its powers, functions, and composition.  The UPSC's establishment and functions are detailed within the Constitution of India, specifically relating to the recruitment of civil servants. Similarly, the NCSC's constitutional basis is found within the Constitution of India, outlining its role in safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes.  All three pairs accurately reflect the primary legal framework governing each body's existence and operation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair, failing to acknowledge the constitutional or statutory basis of these crucial governance bodies.  A comprehensive understanding of India's constitutional and statutory framework is essential for effective governance and public administration, hence the importance of correctly identifying the legal basis for these institutions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Campaign                       Key Feature/Objective
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan                      :  Preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)
2.  AuditOnline application                : Online audit of panchayat accounts
3.  People’s Plan Campaign (PPC)           : Accelerated people's participation in PDP preparation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC), is explicitly focused on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  The AuditOnline application is designed to conduct online audits of panchayat accounts, enhancing transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds.  The People’s Plan Campaign (PPC) aims to accelerate people's participation in the PDP preparation process.  Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the understanding of governance initiatives aimed at improving local governance and financial management at the panchayat level.  The successful implementation of these initiatives hinges on the effective participation of local communities and transparent financial management practices.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Regulation                                 Principal Focus
1. Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005         :  Citizen access to information from public authorities
2. Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024 :  Preventing unfair means in public examinations
3.  Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :  Regulation of foreign funding for NGOs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, is fundamentally about granting citizens the right to access information held by public authorities. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, are designed to prevent cheating and other unfair practices in public examinations.  The Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) regulates the acceptance of foreign funding by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in India.  All three pairs correctly identify the central theme of each act or regulation. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to represent the core function of each legislative instrument. This question assesses knowledge of key legislation impacting transparency, accountability, and the regulatory environment in India.  A thorough understanding of these acts is vital for comprehending the mechanisms of governance and citizen engagement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Committee/Body                                Key Recommendation/Finding
1. Kasturirangan Committee                     :  37% of Western Ghats as Ecologically Sensitive Area
2. Bibek Debroy Committee                      : Liberalization of Indian Railways
3.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Setting global standards for auditing local governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Kasturirangan Committee's key recommendation was to declare 37% of the Western Ghats region as an Ecologically Sensitive Area. The Bibek Debroy Committee recommended the liberalization of Indian Railways, including the introduction of private players. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies. All three pairs accurately reflect the principal focus or outcome associated with each committee or body. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accurate pairing of all three entities with their key recommendations or findings.  This question tests knowledge of significant committees and their contributions to policy and governance in India, highlighting the interplay between environmental concerns, economic reforms, and the strengthening of local governance structures.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Significant Provision/Feature
1.  Post Office Act, 2023                          : Appointment of Director General of Postal Services (DGPS)
2. Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023    : Establishment of Data Protection Board of India (DPBI)
3. Aadhaar Act, 2016                             :  Use of Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Post Office Act, 2023, introduces the position of Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) to head India Post.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data protection.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates the use of Aadhaar for accessing various social welfare schemes.  Each pair accurately reflects a key provision or feature of the respective act. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses understanding of recent legislation related to postal services, data protection, and the use of biometric identification in governance.  Knowledge of these acts is crucial for analyzing the evolving landscape of digital governance and citizen services in India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992     :  Provisions on Urban Local Bodies
2. 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, 1992     :  Provisions on Panchayati Raj Institutions
3. AuditOnline application                       :   World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 are landmark legislation in India concerning local self-governance.  The 73rd Amendment deals specifically with Panchayats (rural local bodies), while the 74th Amendment addresses Municipalities (urban local bodies).  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. Pair 3 is also correct; the AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj,  received the World Summit on Information Society Prizes in 2023.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; the 73rd Amendment focuses on Panchayati Raj Institutions, not Urban Local Bodies.  The 74th Amendment addresses Urban Local Bodies. The options are designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of the roles of these amendments and the award received by the AuditOnline application.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                       Responsibility/Function
1. Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG)       :   Develops the AuditOnline application
2. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA)    :   Works under the technical guidance of the CAG
3. International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) : Aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CAG's role in auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.  The CAG exercises control and supervision over the maintenance of accounts and auditing at all three levels of PRIs/ULBs, often through ELFAs/DLFAs.  Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies, making pair 3 correct.  However, pair 1 is incorrect; the AuditOnline application was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the CAG. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the institutional framework for local body audits in India and the recent developments in this area.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                   Governing Authority/Implementing Body
1. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)           :   NITI Aayog (for revamp)
2. Aadhaar Act, 2016                          :   Ministry of Electronics & IT
3. Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA) :   Ministry of Home Affairs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

NITI Aayog has initiated a process for revamping Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), making pair 1 correct. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) implements the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), correctly matching pair 3. However, pair 2 is incorrect; while Aadhaar is related to the Ministry of Electronics & IT, the Aadhaar Act, 2016, is not solely governed or implemented by that ministry.  Multiple ministries and agencies are involved in its implementation.  This question tests understanding of the key players involved in the implementation and oversight of major government schemes and Acts.  The distractor in option 2 is designed to test the candidate's nuanced understanding of the Aadhaar ecosystem.


**4. With reference to the Indian Constitution, consider the following pairs:**

   Article                                        Subject Matter
1. Article 275                                   :   Grants-in-aid to states
2. Article 280                                   :   Establishment of the National Human Rights Commission
3. Article 282                                   :   Special Packages to states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 275 of the Indian Constitution deals with grants-in-aid to states, making pair 1 correct. Article 282 empowers the Centre and states to make grants for any public purpose, including special packages to states facing socio-economic challenges; hence, pair 3 is correct.  However, pair 2 is incorrect; Article 280 deals with the establishment of the Finance Commission, not the National Human Rights Commission.  The NHRC is established by a separate Act of Parliament. This question tests the understanding of specific articles of the Indian Constitution relating to fiscal federalism and the distribution of resources between the Union and States. The incorrect pairing is strategically placed to assess the candidate's detailed knowledge of constitutional provisions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Institution                     Key Function/Characteristic
1. Union Public Service Commission (UPSC)     :   Conducts examinations for recruitment to state government services
2. National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):  Deals with grievances related to Scheduled Castes
3. Common Service Centres (CSCs)              :   Primary pillar of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC) addresses grievances related to Scheduled Castes, making pair 2 correct.  Common Service Centres (CSCs) are indeed one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), making pair 3 correct. However, pair 1 is incorrect; the UPSC primarily conducts examinations for recruitment to central government services, not state government services. State Public Service Commissions conduct examinations for recruitment to state government services.  This question tests the knowledge of key institutions and their functions within the Indian administrative structure and the digital governance initiatives.  The incorrect pairing is a crucial distractor to test in-depth understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article                  Provision Related To
1. Article 72                               :  President's Power of Pardon
2. Article 129                               :  Supreme Court's Contempt Power
3. Article 215                               :  High Court's Contempt Power
4. Article 244(2)                           :  Establishment of Gram Nyayalayas
5. Article 282                               :  Discretionary Grants


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  Articles 129 and 215, respectively, vest the Supreme Court and High Courts with the inherent power to punish for contempt of court.  Article 282 empowers both the central and state governments to make grants for any public purpose, not necessarily within their legislative competence, which is relevant to the concept of discretionary grants.  Article 244(2) deals with the administration of scheduled areas and tribal areas, not the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas; that is established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects this.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the constitutional provisions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                 Key Feature/Provision
1. Aadhaar Act, 2016                         :   Proof of Citizenship
2. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019   :   Reduced naturalization period for certain migrants
3. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                :   Exempts all states from its jurisdiction
4. Right to Information Act, 2005            :   Exempts all personal information from disclosure
5. Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964       :   Established Foreigners Tribunals


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, notably reduced the naturalization period for certain categories of migrants.  The Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, established the quasi-judicial bodies known as Foreigners Tribunals.  These are correctly matched pairs (2 and 5).  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, is not a proof of citizenship but a unique identification number.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, does not exempt all states but specifically exempts certain states and tribal areas.  The Right to Information Act, 2005,  was later amended by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, to exempt certain personal information, but this wasn't an original feature. Therefore, only option (a) correctly identifies the accurately matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccurate or incomplete pairings, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge about the acts and their provisions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Body                             Function/Power
1. Public Accounts Committee                  :   Examines the budget proposals
2. Estimates Committee                        :   Audits government revenue and expenditure
3. Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages:   Recommends the adoption of Hindi
4. Foreigners Tribunals                       :   Declare a person as a foreigner
5.  International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL): Sets global standards for auditing local bodies


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages plays a crucial role in advising on the implementation of official languages policies, often including recommendations related to Hindi. Foreigners Tribunals hold the authority to declare individuals as foreigners. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) aims to set global standards for auditing local governments. These are all correctly matched (3, 4, and 5). The Public Accounts Committee audits government revenue and expenditure, while the Estimates Committee scrutinizes the budget and suggests improvements.  Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairings.  Options (a), (c), and (d) showcase a misunderstanding of the functions of these bodies, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge about their specific roles and responsibilities within the Indian governance structure.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Type of Contempt of Court                    Description
1. Civil Contempt                            :   Publication that scandalizes a court
2. Criminal Contempt                         :   Wilful disobedience of a court order
3. Civil Contempt                            :   Interference with the administration of justice
4. Criminal Contempt                         :   Willful breach of an undertaking to a court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Wilful disobedience of a court order and willful breach of an undertaking given to a court are both accurate descriptions of criminal contempt.  (pairs 2 and 4).  Publication that scandalizes a court and interference with the administration of justice are aspects of criminal contempt, not civil contempt.  Civil contempt primarily involves the willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings.  Therefore, only option (a) correctly pairs the types of contempt with their accurate descriptions. Options (b), (c), and (d) reflect a conflation of the characteristics of civil and criminal contempt, highlighting the need for precise understanding of legal definitions and procedures.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Financial Provision/Scheme              Characteristic
1. Special Category Status (SCS)            :   Based on Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (historically)
2. Special Financial Packages              :   Purely discretionary grants under Article 282
3. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)        :   Funded solely by the central government
4. Sixth Schedule Areas                     :   Inclusion determined by the Finance Commission


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Historically, Special Category Status (SCS) grants were often distributed based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Special financial packages are indeed purely discretionary grants, authorized under Article 282 of the Constitution.  These are correctly matched (pairs 1 and 2).  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the central government. The inclusion of areas under the Sixth Schedule is not determined by the Finance Commission but by constitutional provisions and related legislation. Therefore, only option (a) correctly identifies the accurate matches. Options (b), (c), and (d) contain inaccuracies, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of the funding mechanisms and constitutional provisions related to different financial schemes and provisions within the Indian federal system.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Amendment                                  Key Provision/Feature
1. Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008                    :   Exempts Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas.
2. Contempt of Courts Act, 1971                  :   Defines both civil and criminal contempt of court.
3. Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019        :   Amends the Citizenship Act, 1955, relating to citizenship by naturalization.
4. Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985           :   Establishes the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).
5.  Indian Evidence Act, 1872                     :   Replaced by Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts certain states and tribal areas. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework for contempt proceedings, distinguishing between civil and criminal contempt. The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, directly amends the Citizenship Act of 1955, introducing changes to the process of acquiring citizenship.  The Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985, is the foundational legislation for the establishment and functioning of the CAT. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 has indeed been replaced by the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching of all pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A thorough understanding of Indian legal and administrative frameworks is crucial to correctly answer this question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Article/Provision             Related Subject/Power
1. Article 72                                  :   President's power to grant pardons.
2. Article 129                                 :   Supreme Court's power to punish contempt.
3. Article 215                                 :   High Courts' power to punish contempt.

The other options are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of various government schemes, initiatives, and institutions related to governance, justice, and rural development.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Scheme/Act                                     Key Feature/Provision
1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign) :   Introduced as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018
2. Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution    :   Resulted from recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee
3. Article 282 of the Indian Constitution        :   Empowers the Centre and states to make discretionary grants
4. Aadhaar Act, 2016                             :   Aadhaar mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes (as per 2018 SC Judgement)
5. Right to Information Act, 2005              :   Replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, was initially known as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), directly stems from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. Article 282 explicitly grants the power to the central and state governments to provide discretionary grants for public purposes.  The 2018 Supreme Court judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* affirmed the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act and its use for accessing social welfare schemes, although not mandatory for all services. Finally, the Right to Information Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.  Therefore, option (d) encompasses all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Constitutional Provision/Body                  Function/Power
1. Article 72                                     :   Grants pardons, reprieves, etc., for offences against Union laws
2. Curative Petition                             :   Last constitutional remedy after review petition dismissal by SC
3. Foreigners Tribunals                           :   Power to declare a person a foreigner in India
4.  President's Mercy Petition                     :   Relates to death sentences and court-martial convictions
5.  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs)          :   Swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases, including death sentences and court-martial convictions. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  Foreigners Tribunals, established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, possess the sole authority to declare an individual a foreigner. The President's power to consider mercy petitions extends to death sentences and court-martial convictions, as explicitly mentioned in Article 72. Finally, the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) were established to expedite the disposal of cases related to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.



**3.  With reference to Indian Governance, consider the following pairs:**

4. Law Commission of India                         :   Reviews and recommends changes to laws
5. NITI Aayog                                     :   Formulates national development strategies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the mandates and functions of the respective bodies. The NCSC addresses grievances related to Scheduled Castes, State Finance Commissions distribute financial resources among local governments within their respective states, the CVC tackles corruption within the Central Government, the Law Commission reviews and suggests amendments to laws, and NITI Aayog designs and implements national development strategies.  Each description accurately represents the core function of the named body. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.

4.  Model Code of Conduct (MCC)                  :    Election Commission of India (ECI)
5.  RTI Act, 2005                                 :    Department of Personnel and Training


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The NITI Aayog is currently leading the revamp of Centrally Sponsored Schemes. The Ministry of Electronics & IT oversees the implementation of the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) is responsible for the EVM-VVPAT system and the enforcement of the Model Code of Conduct.  Finally, the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions coordinates the implementation of the Right to Information Act, 2005. Each pairing accurately reflects the responsible authority or agency for the respective act or scheme.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, which includes all correctly matched pairs. Other options are incomplete and therefore incorrect.

3.  Assam Accord, 1985                            :   Confers citizenship to migrants from East Pakistan until March 24, 1971
4. Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964             :   Establishes quasi-judicial bodies to determine foreigner status.
5. Passport Act, 1920                              :   Governs the issuance of passports in India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Citizenship Act of 1955 lays the foundation for Indian citizenship, outlining the processes for acquiring and losing citizenship. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, are designed to implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019. The Assam Accord of 1985 addresses the issue of citizenship for migrants from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).
