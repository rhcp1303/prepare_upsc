How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

Statement 2 is correct; Gram Nyayalayas are situated at intermediate Panchayat headquarters. Statement 3 is also correct; they function as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class and handle both civil and criminal cases at the village level.  Statement 4 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas aim for conciliation, they are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, operating instead on principles of natural justice.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:**

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, details the procedures, Articles 129 (Supreme Court) and 215 (High Courts) of the Constitution grant inherent powers to punish contempt. Statement 2 accurately describes the distinction between civil and criminal contempt. Statement 3 is correct; the constitutional articles mentioned provide the basis for the courts' power. Statement 4 is incorrect. While a state government *can* file a contempt petition, it's not a direct power but rather a recourse available when they believe the central government has disobeyed a court order.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's judgment in *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh & Others*:**

1.  The judgment prohibits sub-classification of Scheduled Castes for the purpose of quota allocation.

4.  The judgment mandates that sub-classification within Scheduled Castes must adhere to the 50% upper ceiling on reservations.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment *permits* sub-classification of Scheduled Castes to address varying degrees of backwardness within the SC community. Statement 2 correctly describes the roles of Article 341(1) and 341(2) in specifying and modifying the Scheduled Caste list. Statement 3 is correct; the court emphasized that sub-classification must be justified by data showing backwardness and inadequate representation, not arbitrary decisions. Statement 4 is incorrect. The judgment does not uphold the 50% ceiling in the context of sub-classification within the SC category.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements comparing First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems:**

1. FPTP systems are simpler to understand and tend to produce stable governments.
2. PR systems ensure proportional representation of all parties based on their vote share.
3. FPTP systems always ensure the winning candidate secures a majority of votes in their constituency.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct; FPTP is easier to understand, and generally leads to single-party majority governments. Statement 2 is largely correct; PR aims for proportional representation but the exact mechanism can vary.  Statement 3 is incorrect. In FPTP, a candidate can win with a plurality (most votes), not necessarily an absolute majority.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 72 grants the President pardon powers in cases tried by court-martial and offenses against laws to which the Union's executive power extends. Statement 2 is correct; the President can commute (reduce) death sentences. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not entirely immune to judicial review in exceptional circumstances.  Statement 4 is correct; the President's power explicitly includes cases tried by court-martial.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last* resort, filed only after a review petition is dismissed. Statement 2 is correct; Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, which forms the basis for curative petitions. Statement 3 is incorrect. While violation of natural justice is a ground, other grounds like judicial bias or errors of law also allow filing a curative petition. Statement 4 is correct; the *Rupa Ashok Hurra* case established the framework for curative petitions. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many FTSCs handle POCSO cases, they are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not solely state-sponsored. Statement 2 is incorrect; the central government bears the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 3 is correct; the primary objective is fast disposal of rape and POCSO cases. Statement 4 is incorrect;  the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for implementing FTSCs. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act declares that the religious character of a place of worship will remain as it was on August 15, 1947,  It does not mandate conversion. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act states that pending cases regarding conversion of religious character of places of worship, existing before August 15, 1947, will abate.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  Their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, but only those deemed "petty disputes."

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, provides the statutory backing for the establishment and functioning of Gram Nyayalayas.  Statement 2 is also correct. Gram Nyayalayas possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction but are primarily designed to resolve petty disputes at the village level.  Statement 3 is accurate. While aiming for swift dispute resolution, Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but adhere to the principles of natural justice.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Nyayadhikari for each Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State government in consultation with the High Court, not the Central Government. This reflects the decentralized nature of their operations within the state judicial framework.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 3) are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:**

1.  It is defined exclusively under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish contempt from Articles 129 and 215 respectively.

(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the primary legislation defining contempt, the inherent powers of the courts to maintain their authority also play a role.  Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt. Statement 3 accurately differentiates between civil and criminal contempt, outlining their key characteristics.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The Jharkhand government's petition highlights a dispute regarding the appointment of the Chief Justice, a process involving both the Centre and the State, not solely the State government's power.  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 accurately describe aspects of Contempt of Court.


**3. Consider the following features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) explicitly aims to increase public participation in PDP preparation. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development, launched the campaign. Statement 3 is correct. The campaign utilizes structured Gram Sabhas, and other sabhas, across all three Panchayat tiers for participatory planning. Statement 4 is incorrect. The thematic gaps are identified using the Panchayat Development Index (PDI), not a Panchayat Development Report (PDR).  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 correctly describe aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.

1. It is the first such center in the world.
2. It aims to establish international standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the iCAL and its objectives?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is the first of its kind in *India*, not the world.  Statement 2 is correct; a key goal is setting global standards for local governance audits. Statement 3 is correct; it serves as a collaborative platform. Statement 4 is incorrect; iCAL doesn't directly audit accounts but focuses on capacity building and establishing standards.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect iCAL's role and objectives.

3. FPTP systems always ensure majority representation for winning candidates.
4. PR systems always lead to stable coalition governments.


Which of the above statements correctly highlight differences between FPTP and PR electoral systems?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FPTP divides a country into smaller constituencies, electing one representative per constituency, while PR systems can use larger constituencies or even the entire country as a single constituency. Statement 2 is correct.  FPTP elects one representative per constituency, whereas PR allows for the election of multiple representatives from a single constituency, reflecting the proportion of votes received by each party. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Winning candidates in FPTP systems do not always secure a majority of votes; they simply need more votes than any other candidate. Statement 4 is incorrect. PR systems often lead to coalition governments, but these are not always stable.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key differences between FPTP and PR.


**6. Consider the following regarding the requirements for citizenship by naturalization in India:**

(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Knowledge of a language from the Eighth Schedule is a requirement. Statement 2 is incorrect. The required residency period is typically 11 years, not 15. Statement 3 is correct.  Renunciation of previous citizenship is a necessary condition. Statement 4 is incorrect. Applications are usually submitted through a District Level Committee to the Empowered Committee, not directly to the Ministry of Home Affairs.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the requirements for naturalization.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:**

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAA grants citizenship to religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who entered India before a specific date, fulfilling other conditions. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act specifically *exempts* certain tribal areas and those under Inner Line Permits from its application. Statement 3 is correct.  The Act reduces the naturalization period for the specified groups. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act allows for OCI cancellation under specific grounds, not all circumstances.

1. Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile.
2. The Supreme Court declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional in its 2018 judgement.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address, not citizenship or domicile. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, with certain conditions. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Court mandated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. Statement 4 is correct. The Court ruled that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes, but not for other services.  Therefore, only statement 4 is accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States. Statement 2 is incorrect. They are implemented through State Governments. Statement 3 is incorrect.  They operate in sectors falling under both State and Concurrent Lists. Statement 4 is correct. The current framework is influenced by the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs. Therefore, only statement 4 is accurate.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The Governor, not the President, creates ADCs under the Sixth Schedule. Statement 2 is correct. ADCs possess significant legislative and executive powers, including those related to land revenue and taxation. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule applies only to specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Statement 4 is incorrect. The PESA Act, 1996, applies to Fifth Schedule areas, not Sixth Schedule areas. Therefore, only statements 1 (with correction) and 2 accurately describe the Sixth Schedule.

(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 outlines the process of state formation and alteration. Statement 2 is correct. The President's recommendation is a constitutional requirement before a bill can be introduced in Parliament. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Parliament, not the state legislative assembly, holds the power to form new states. Statement 4 is incorrect. While public opinion is considered, a referendum is not constitutionally mandated. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the constitutional procedure.


**12. Consider the following regarding the Parliamentary Committees in India:**

1.  They are appointed or elected by the Rajya Sabha only.
2.  The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of state governments.

(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is false as Gram Nyayalayas, while using conciliation, are not bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but rather by principles of natural justice.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the President's power extends to offences against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power. Statement 3 is false; a mercy petition is not a prerequisite for a curative petition.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed historically used as a basis for allocating funds to states with Special Category Status.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the Special Category Status, not its introduction. The concept originated earlier, with the Fifth Finance Commission.

Statement 3 is correct. The CBI's operations and functions are governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The CBI's motto is "Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity," not "Justice, Integrity, and Impartiality."


**10. Consider the following statements about the auditing of local bodies in India:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is mandated to audit local bodies under the Panchayati Raj Act, 1992.
2.  The AuditOnline application facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.
3.  Examiners of Local Fund Accounts (ELFAs) work independently of the CAG.
4.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts provide a framework for local self-governance.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, not the Panchayati Raj Act, 1992.  The Panchayati Raj Act establishes the structure of local governance, while the CAG Act defines the CAG's auditing responsibilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a government initiative to streamline and improve the auditing process of panchayat accounts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ELFAs/DLFAs operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not independently.

Statement 4 is correct. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 are foundational laws that laid the groundwork for the establishment and functioning of local self-governing bodies (Panchayats and Municipalities) in India.


1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, including corporation tax and personal income tax, between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based on criteria like population and area.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states by the Centre as per Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the approval of the Union Government.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending this distribution, ensuring a balance of resources between the Centre and the states.  Corporation tax and personal income tax are key components of this revenue sharing arrangement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of the divisible pool of taxes allocated to the states from the Union's revenue. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, is the distribution *among* states from the share allocated to them, based on various criteria such as income distance, area, population, etc., as determined by the Finance Commission.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to make grants-in-aid to states that are in need of special financial assistance.  These grants are often provided to states with specific developmental challenges or revenue deficits.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the Union government can borrow both within and outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only within India (Article 293). Furthermore, if a state is indebted to the Union, it requires the Union's prior consent for further borrowing.  This highlights the inherent fiscal imbalance within the federal structure.


2. Consider the following features of Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria for granting SCS to states.
2.  SCS states receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission abolished the SCS framework.
4.  States granted SCS historically included Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not explicitly define criteria for granting Special Category Status (SCS).  The designation was based on recommendations of Finance Commissions and considerations of geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  This discretionary nature has been a source of contention.

Statement 2 is correct. Historically, SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, which considered various factors related to the state's developmental needs. However, this formula was not enshrined in law and its application varied over time.

Statement 3 is correct. Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS framework, as it existed, was effectively abolished. The rationale was to move towards a more equitable and transparent system of resource allocation.  This didn't eliminate special funding for states with unique needs, but shifted the mechanism away from the SCS label.

Statement 4 is correct. Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were among the first states to be granted SCS in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, reflecting their unique developmental challenges.  Other states were granted SCS subsequently.


3. Consider the following aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):

1.  CSSs are funded solely by the Central Government.
2.  CSSs are implemented exclusively by the Central Government.
3.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
4.  Funding for CSSs is routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are jointly funded by the Central and State governments, with varying funding patterns depending on the scheme and the state. The funding-sharing ratio is usually 60:40 for most states, but it can differ for special category states like those in the North East and Himalayas (90:10).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CSSs are implemented *through* the State Governments.  While the Centre designs and guides the schemes, the actual on-the-ground execution is the responsibility of the state machinery. This reflects the federal nature of India's governance.

Statement 3 is correct. The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, submitted in 2015. This report aimed to streamline the CSS system and improve its efficiency.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  All transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India. This ensures that states have control over the utilization of funds received for these centrally sponsored initiatives.


4.  Consider the following regarding the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010:

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible for implementing the FCRA.
2.  NGOs need prior permission to receive foreign funds, involving Aadhaar submission by office-bearers.
3.  Funds received under FCRA can be freely transferred to any other person or NGO.
4.  The maximum permissible use of foreign contribution for administrative expenses is 50%.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the nodal ministry for the implementation of the FCRA, which regulates the acceptance and utilization of foreign funds by NGOs and other organizations.

Statement 2 is correct.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate prior permission for receiving foreign funds and require Aadhaar submission from office bearers of NGOs seeking registration under FCRA. This is aimed at enhancing transparency and accountability.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Funds received under FCRA must be deposited in a designated FCRA account and cannot be transferred to any other person or NGO. This restriction aims to prevent misuse of foreign funds.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The maximum permissible use of foreign contributions for administrative expenses is 20%, not 50%, as per the amended FCRA.  This aims to ensure that the majority of funds are utilized for the intended purpose of the NGO’s work, not administration.


5. Consider the following statements about the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:

1. The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is responsible for hearing appeals against its decisions.
2. Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.
3. Data fiduciaries must inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a data breach.
4. The Act prohibits the cross-border transfer of personal data under any circumstances.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against the decisions of the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the DPBI itself.  This ensures an independent appellate mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act grants data principals several rights, including the right to access, correct, and even erase their personal data held by data fiduciaries. This empowers individuals to control their personal information.

Statement 3 is correct. Data fiduciaries, the entities responsible for processing personal data, have a clear obligation to report data breaches to the DPBI and the affected individuals.  This transparency is crucial for maintaining data security and trust.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act *allows* the transfer of personal data outside India, except to countries restricted by the government.  This allows for international collaborations and data sharing while maintaining safeguards against data exploitation.


6. Consider the following about the  Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024:

1. The rules provide for the venue-in-charge to file an FIR in case of unfair means.
2. A committee is constituted by the examination authority if management or board of directors of a service provider is involved in unfair means.
3. The rules apply only to examinations conducted by the Central Government.
4. The rules mandate the use of biometric authentication for all examinees.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rules empower the venue-in-charge to take appropriate action, including filing an FIR, if a prima facie case of unfair means or other offenses related to the conduct of public examinations is reported. This ensures prompt action against malpractices.

Statement 2 is correct.  The rules stipulate the formation of a committee by the public examination authority if the management or board of directors of a service provider is involved in any malpractice. This ensures impartiality and a thorough investigation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The rules are applicable to public examinations irrespective of the conducting body, be it the Central Government, State Governments, or other public authorities.  The scope is broad to ensure integrity across all public examinations.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The rules don't mandate biometric authentication.  While technology may be used to enhance security, the rules focus on the processes and procedures for preventing and addressing unfair means, not on specific technological requirements.


7. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016:

1.  Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile.
2.  Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
3.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in 2018.
4.  Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts and mobile connections.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* stipulated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This ruling aimed to protect the privacy of individuals.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court affirmed the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, in its 2018 judgment, while also setting limitations on its use and data retention.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court clarified that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but not for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  This ruling protects individual rights while still allowing Aadhaar's use in targeted welfare delivery.


8. Consider the following about the  Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule provides for autonomous district councils in certain states.
3. The Sixth Schedule applies to all states in Northeast India.
4. The Sixth Schedule was introduced to address the unique needs of tribal communities.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2) of the Indian Constitution, was indeed based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, which aimed to address the specific administrative and political needs of tribal areas in Assam.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states, primarily in Northeast India. These councils have significant powers in matters of local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule primarily applies to states in Northeast India, it doesn't apply to all states in the region.  The specific application is to certain areas within the states mentioned in the Schedule.

Statement 4 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was introduced to address the unique needs and aspirations of tribal communities in specific areas, recognizing their distinct cultural and administrative requirements within the broader Indian federal structure.  The councils provide a degree of self-governance.


9. Consider the following about  Protected and Restricted Areas in India:

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Restricted Area.
3.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs access to Restricted Areas.
4.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely located within a Protected Area as defined under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  This reflects the sensitive geopolitical and environmental considerations in the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sikkim is partly in a Protected Area and partly in a Restricted Area.  The designation varies within the state depending on specific geographical and security considerations.

Statement 3 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, legally defines and regulates access to Restricted Areas in India.  This order is a crucial instrument for managing access to sensitive border areas and regions with unique environmental features.

Statement 4 is correct.  Foreigners, with the exception of Bhutanese citizens, generally need special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas. This requirement is in place to ensure security and to manage the impact of tourism and other activities in these sensitive areas.  The permitting process is overseen by relevant authorities.


10. Consider the following aspects of the  Mission Karmayogi:

1. Mission Karmayogi aims to create a future-ready civil service.
2. Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, including contractual employees.
3. Mission Karmayogi focuses on rule-based training and capacity building.
4. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was launched as part of Mission Karmayogi.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mission Karmayogi's core objective is to transform the Indian civil service into a highly skilled, adaptable, and future-ready workforce capable of meeting the challenges of a rapidly evolving India.

Statement 2 is correct. The scope of Mission Karmayogi encompasses all civil servants, irrespective of their employment status (permanent or contractual), across various ministries and departments of the Union Government.  This broad scope aims for comprehensive capacity building.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a *shift from rule-based to role-based* training and capacity building.  This paradigm shift focuses on developing competencies relevant to specific roles and responsibilities, rather than simply adhering to prescribed rules.

Statement 4 is correct. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was established in 2021 as a key component of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), which is the formal name for Mission Karmayogi.  The CBC plays a pivotal role in designing and overseeing capacity-building initiatives.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas."
2.  It aims to enhance participation in Panchayat Development Plan (PDP) formulation.
3. The campaign exclusively involves elected representatives and government officials.
4.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) plays a role in identifying developmental gaps.


How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, initially called "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," was indeed launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Statement 2 is also correct; a core objective is to boost people's involvement in crafting PDPs.  Statement 4 is true; the PDI helps pinpoint areas needing development. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The Abhiyan's implementation involves a broader range of stakeholders beyond just elected officials and government workers; it explicitly includes community-based organizations (CBOs) like SHGs and other relevant parties. This makes option (c) the accurate answer.


**2. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSS funding is exclusively managed by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States.  Statement 4 is incorrect: CSSs are implemented *through* state governments, not solely by the Centre. Statement 3 is incorrect: While the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations did influence the funding mechanism, stating it as the *sole* significant impact is an oversimplification.  The shift from Plan-Non Plan distinction and the increased importance of CSSs is a major impact, but not the only one.  Only statement 2 is correct.  Therefore, the correct option is (d).


**3. Consider the following regarding the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1. The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used for SCS grants.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS.
4.  Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have recently demanded special financial packages, not SCS.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Constitution does *not* explicitly mention SCS. Statement 2 is correct:  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for allocating grants to SCS states. Statement 3 is correct: The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS framework. Statement 4 is also correct:  The recent demands from Bihar and Andhra Pradesh are for special financial packages, not a revival of the SCS designation.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects the correct statements.



**4. Consider the following statements related to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR):**

1. ADR mechanisms are exclusively used for civil disputes.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is irrelevant to international commercial arbitration.
3.  The Supreme Court's Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) plays a crucial role in promoting ADR.
4. ADR processes always involve a judge as a neutral third party.


How many of the statements given above are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: ADR encompasses various types of disputes, including commercial and industrial ones. Statement 2 is incorrect: The 1996 Act is applicable to a wide range of arbitrations, including many aspects of international commercial arbitration. Statement 3 is correct: The MCPC is actively involved in promoting mediation and conciliation within the ADR framework. Statement 4 is incorrect:  ADR typically uses a *neutral third party*, which is not necessarily a judge. Therefore, three statements are incorrect, making (c) the correct option.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. The DPBI's decisions are not subject to any appellate process.
2. Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.
3. The DPBI is empowered to impose penalties for non-compliance.
4.  Data fiduciaries are not obligated to inform the DPBI in case of data breaches.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The DPBI has the power to impose penalties. Statement 4 is incorrect: Data fiduciaries are required to inform the DPBI about data breaches.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making (b) the correct option.


**6. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was solely based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. It applies to all states in India.
3. It deals with the administration of tribal areas.
4. It is directly related to Article 244(2).


How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were influential, it wasn't the *sole* basis for the Sixth Schedule. Statement 2 is incorrect; it applies only to specific tribal areas in certain states. Statement 3 is correct; the Schedule deals with the governance of these areas. Statement 4 is correct; Article 244(2) directly relates to the Sixth Schedule.  Therefore, three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer.



**7. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  The President can only grant pardons for offenses against Union laws.
2. Article 72 empowers the President to commute death sentences.
3. The President's decision on a mercy petition is always final and not subject to judicial review.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The President's pardon power extends beyond just offenses against Union laws. Statement 2 is correct: Article 72 explicitly includes the power to commute death sentences. Statement 3 is incorrect: While the President's decision carries significant weight, it's not entirely immune to judicial scrutiny in exceptional circumstances. Statement 4 is correct:  The President can indeed grant pardons for court-martial offenses. Therefore, options 2, and 4 are correct, making (d) the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following about Mission Karmayogi:**

1.  It exclusively focuses on training newly recruited civil servants.
2. It promotes a shift from rule-based to role-based training.

4. It covers only permanent civil servants.


Which of the statements given above are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: Mission Karmayogi aims at capacity building for all civil servants, irrespective of their years of service. Statement 2 is correct: The shift to role-based training is a key principle. Statement 3 is incorrect: While the Ministry plays a central role, other ministries and agencies are involved in implementation.  Statement 4 is incorrect: It explicitly includes contractual employees. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. Consider the following statements concerning the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The NHRC was established in 1993 in accordance with the Paris Principles.

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body.  It was established through a statute, not enshrined in the Constitution itself.  Statement 2 is correct: The NHRC's establishment was indeed influenced by the Paris Principles. Statement 3 is incorrect: The NHRC does not possess the power to directly punish individuals. Its role is primarily investigative and recommendatory. Statement 4 is also incorrect: The NHRC's recommendations are not legally binding, though they carry significant moral and persuasive weight.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.


**10. Consider the following regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL is the first center of its kind globally.
2. iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3. iCAL is located in Mumbai.
4. iCAL is funded solely by the Government of Gujarat.


Which of the statements given above is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: While it's the first of its kind in India, it's not the first globally; similar centers exist in other countries. Statement 2 is correct: Setting global standards is a key objective. Statement 3 is incorrect: iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai. Statement 4 is also likely incorrect: While the Gujarat government is heavily involved, funding likely involves other sources as well. Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect, making (c) the correct option.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's address to Parliament:

1.  Article 87(1) initially mandated the President to address both Houses at the start of every session.
2.  The First Amendment Act of 1951 altered this provision.
3.  The President's address is constitutionally mandated at the commencement of the first session following each general election.
4.  The President's address is constitutionally mandated at the commencement of the first session of each year.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions concerning the President's address to Parliament?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  Article 87(1) originally stipulated that the President must address both Houses of Parliament at the beginning of every session.  The First Amendment Act of 1951 modified this requirement, reflecting the evolving parliamentary practices.  The President is constitutionally required to address Parliament at the commencement of the first session after a general election. This ensures that the newly elected representatives are informed of the government's policies and priorities.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while the President often addresses Parliament at the beginning of each year's session, this is a convention, not a constitutional mandate. The Constitution doesn't explicitly specify an annual address.  The frequency of the address is a matter of established practice and political convention, not a rigid constitutional requirement.


2. Consider the following regarding the oath of Members of Parliament (MPs):

1.  Article 99 outlines the oath-taking procedure for MPs before the President or a designated individual.
2.  The Third Schedule details the forms of the oath.
3.  Article 104 mandates a penalty for MPs participating in House proceedings without taking the oath.
4.  Oaths can be administered in English or any of the 22 scheduled languages.
5.  An individual can become a minister without being elected to Parliament and participate in proceedings (without voting rights).

Which of the above statements accurately describe the constitutional provisions related to the oath of MPs?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five statements correctly reflect the constitutional provisions related to the oath-taking process of MPs. Article 99 details the constitutional procedure for administering the oath. The forms of the oath are specified in the Third Schedule. Article 104 outlines the penalties for non-compliance. The choice of language for the oath is constitutionally guaranteed to be either English or any of the 22 scheduled languages.  Finally, the exception that allows an individual to be appointed as a minister without prior election to Parliament and participate in House proceedings (though without voting rights) is also factually accurate.  Therefore, all statements are correct.


3. Consider the following aspects of the Citizenship Act, 1955:

1.  It outlines five methods of acquiring citizenship.
2.  It explicitly permits dual citizenship.
3.  Section 6A, added via the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, is a specific provision related to the Assam Accord.
4.  Countries like the US, UK, and Pakistan allow dual citizenship.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions and features of the Citizenship Act, 1955?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Citizenship Act, 1955, indeed outlines five ways to acquire Indian citizenship. Section 6A was a key addition linked to the Assam Accord.  Many countries, including the US, UK, and Pakistan, do permit dual citizenship.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Citizenship Act of 1955 does *not* permit dual citizenship.  India generally adheres to the principle of single citizenship, meaning a person can be a citizen of only one country at a time.  The other statements correctly identify specific aspects of the Act and related legislation.


4. Consider the following regarding the President's power of mercy:

1.  Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences.
2.  This power extends to sentences by court-martial.
3.  This power applies only to offenses under Union laws.
4.  This power encompasses death sentences.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the President's power of mercy as outlined in the Constitution?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President extensive powers regarding sentences, including pardons, reprieves, respites, commutations, and remissions.  This power extends to sentences awarded by court-martial.  The President also has the authority to commute a death sentence.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The President's power of mercy extends to offenses under both Union and State laws.  The scope of this power is broad and encompasses a wide range of criminal cases.


5. Consider the following concerning curative petitions in India:

1.  It is the final constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed.
2.  It originated from the Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra case.
3.  The curative power of the Supreme Court stems from Article 142.
4.  A curative petition can be filed only if there's a violation of principles of natural justice.
5.  A curative petition can be filed to challenge the judge's undisclosed connections to the case.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the features and grounds of a curative petition?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect the nature and characteristics of curative petitions in the Indian legal system.  A curative petition is the last available legal recourse after a review petition is rejected by the Supreme Court. It's rooted in the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice.  The case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra played a crucial role in establishing the framework for curative petitions.  Violation of natural justice and undisclosed connections of judges are among the valid grounds for filing a curative petition.  Therefore, all statements are correct.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics and status of FTSCs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct. FTSCs were initiated in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme. The Nirbhaya Fund provides significant financial support for their operations. The Department of Justice is responsible for implementing the scheme.  Their primary goal is to expedite the resolution of rape and POCSO Act cases.  Statement 5 is incorrect. While a significant number of FTSCs are operational,  the total number functioning is not equal to the initially planned 1023.  The text states that 755 FTSCs (out of 1023) are functional.


7. Consider the following statements concerning Cantonment Boards in India:

1.  Cantonments primarily house military troops.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are accurate depictions of Cantonment Boards. Cantonments are areas primarily designed to accommodate military personnel.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs their administration.  Their administration is a Union subject, falling under the Union List.  The Station Commander holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board.  Barrackpore was indeed the location of the first cantonment established in 1765.


8. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues:

1.  A recent judgment recognized the right to be free from adverse climate change effects.
2.  This right is linked to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's recent rulings on environmental issues and constitutional rights?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  A recent Supreme Court judgment did indeed recognize a right to be free from the harmful effects of climate change.  This right was linked to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.  The case cited, M.K. Ranjitsinh v. Union of India,  was instrumental in this ruling.  Articles 14 and 21 indeed guarantee the rights to equality and life, respectively.  The Supreme Court's decision highlights the evolving interpretation of fundamental rights in the context of environmental concerns.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the key features and origins of the 42nd Amendment Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act.  It added Articles 323A and 323B to the Constitution. These articles established the framework for administrative tribunals at both the central and state levels.  The amendment also addressed matters related to taxation and land reforms.  The Swaran Singh Committee submitted recommendations that significantly influenced the provisions of this amendment.  The 42nd Amendment was a landmark act with far-reaching consequences for the Indian administrative and judicial systems.


10. Consider the following about the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle:

1.  It was affirmed by a Supreme Court two-judge bench in Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India.
2.  Denying bail in deserving cases violates Article 21 rights.
3.  Section 479 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, deals with bail in bailable offenses.
4.  The principle applies equally to special statutes like the UAPA, 1967.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the legal principles and provisions related to bail in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe the legal principles and provisions regarding bail in India. The Supreme Court's ruling in Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India reinforced the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle. Denying bail unjustly is a violation of Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty). The BNSS, 2023, has provisions regarding bail in bailable offenses. Importantly, the principle applies even to stringent laws like the UAPA, 1967, emphasizing the importance of due process and the presumption of innocence.  The statements accurately reflect the judicial interpretation and statutory provisions related to bail.


11. Consider the following statements regarding plea bargaining:

1. It enables pre-trial negotiations between the defendant and prosecution.
2. Section 290 of the BNSS, 2023, introduces a time-bound framework for plea bargaining applications.
3.  Plea bargaining applications must be submitted within 30 days of the framing of charges.
4.  Plea bargaining is not applicable in cases involving the death penalty.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the aspects of plea bargaining under the BNSS, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Plea bargaining allows for pre-trial settlements between the accused and the prosecution. The BNSS, 2023, introduces a time limit for plea bargaining applications, requiring submission within 30 days of the framing of charges.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the applicability of plea bargaining in death penalty cases is not explicitly mentioned in the given context and may vary depending on specific legal interpretations and court precedents.  The other statements accurately reflect the provisions of the BNSS, 2023, regarding plea bargaining.


12. Consider the following about the National Emergency provisions in India:

1.  Part XVIII of the Constitution deals with emergency provisions.
2.  The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, introduced changes to emergency provisions.
3.  A resolution to approve an emergency requires a special majority in both Houses.
4.  The President can revoke an emergency proclamation without parliamentary approval.

How many of these statements accurately describe the constitutional provisions related to National Emergencies in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. Part XVIII of the Constitution outlines the provisions for National Emergencies.  The 44th Amendment Act brought significant modifications to these provisions, enhancing safeguards against misuse.  Approval of a National Emergency requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament.  Crucially, the President possesses the power to revoke an emergency proclamation without needing further parliamentary approval.  These aspects are essential to understanding the constitutional framework surrounding National Emergencies in India.


13. Consider the following regarding the Anti-Defection Law:

1.  It is enshrined in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court has dismissed petitions challenging its constitutionality.
3.  It aims to prevent defections among elected representatives.
4.  It is intended to maintain political stability.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Anti-Defection Law and its legal standing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The Anti-Defection Law is formally included in the 10th Schedule of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has heard and dismissed challenges to its constitutionality, affirming its legal validity. The law's primary purpose is to prevent the shifting of allegiances among elected representatives, thus promoting political stability.  These points accurately reflect the nature, purpose, and legal standing of the Anti-Defection Law.


14. Consider the following about the Right to Information Act (RTI):

1.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a Public Authority (PA).
2.  Section 8 of the RTI Act lists exemptions from disclosure.
3.  Lower courts are authorized to entertain suits related to RTI.
4.  The RTI Act mandates a 30-day timeframe for providing information.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the provisions and features of the Right to Information Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The CIC is indeed a Public Authority under the RTI Act.  Section 8 specifies exemptions from disclosure.  The Act sets a 30-day deadline for providing information (with exceptions for urgent cases).  Statement 3 is incorrect. Lower courts generally lack jurisdiction in RTI-related matters; appeals typically go to higher courts or tribunals.


15. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:

1.  It provides a 12-digit unique identification number.
2.  No resident can have a duplicate Aadhaar number.
3.  It is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
4.  It serves as definitive proof of date of birth.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the features and functions of Aadhaar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Aadhaar provides a unique 12-digit identification number.  Duplicate Aadhaar numbers are prevented by the system's design.  The UIDAI is the issuing authority.  Statement 4 is incorrect. While Aadhaar can be used to *establish* identity, it is *not* considered conclusive proof of date of birth by the Supreme Court.  Other documents might be necessary for verifying date of birth.


16. Consider the following regarding election petitions in India:

1.  Appeals from election petitions lie with the Supreme Court.
2.  An election petition can be filed by any candidate.
3.  An elector can file an election petition only if it relates to their personal election.
4.  Section 33 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA), outlines nomination requirements.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of election laws in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  Appeals from election petitions go to the Supreme Court.  Any candidate can file an election petition.  An elector can file a petition if it directly impacts their participation in the specific election.  Section 33 of the RPA, 1951, does indeed detail the requirements for valid nominations.  These are all key aspects of India's election laws.


17. Consider the following concerning re-polling in elections:

1.  Re-polling can be ordered due to natural calamities.
2.  It can be ordered due to damage to voting machines.
3.  It can be ordered if a candidate from a recognized political party dies.
4.  Re-polling is mandatory if booth capturing occurs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the circumstances that may necessitate re-polling in Indian elections?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Re-polling can be ordered due to natural calamities or other unforeseen circumstances that disrupt the electoral process.  Damage to voting machines could necessitate a re-poll in affected areas.  The death of a candidate from a recognized political party may also necessitate re-polling.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while booth capturing is a serious offense, re-polling is not necessarily *mandatory*.  The Election Commission has the discretion to decide the appropriate course of action, which might include re-polling or other measures.


18. Consider the following concerning the "silence period" in Indian elections:

1.  It is a period of ban on political campaigning before voting.
2.  It is mandated by the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
3.  Its duration is uniform across all states and constituencies.
4.  It aims to ensure a fair and unbiased election.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the purpose and features of the "silence period" in elections?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The silence period is a pre-election period where campaigning is prohibited to ensure a fair and peaceful voting environment. This is mandated under electoral laws. The primary goal is to allow voters to make informed decisions without the immediate influence of political campaigning.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While there is a silence period, its exact duration isn't necessarily uniform across all states and constituencies; it might vary slightly depending on the specific electoral context.


19. Consider the following regarding the power of Parliament to alter state names:

1.  It is granted by Article 3 of the Constitution.
2.  Such a bill requires the President's prior recommendation.
3.  Parliament can alter state boundaries through ordinary legislation.
4.  Consultation with State Legislatures is required before altering state names.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the parliamentary powers concerning state name changes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Article 3 of the Constitution empowers Parliament to alter state names.  Bills related to Article 3 require the President's prior recommendation.  Consultation with the concerned state legislature is constitutionally mandated before altering a state's name or boundaries.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Parliament can create new states, altering boundaries often requires a more complex process beyond simple majority legislation, potentially involving state legislature consultations.


20. Consider the following about Gram Nyayalayas:

1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They are located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters.
3.  They function as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class.
4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the features and functioning of Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008. They are typically located at the headquarters of intermediate Panchayats.  They are deemed courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class.  Statement 4 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; they are guided by principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence.


21. Consider the following regarding contempt of court:

1.  It is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish contempt.
3.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience to court orders.
4.  Criminal contempt includes acts that scandalize the authority of a court.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the different aspects of contempt of court?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately define different elements of contempt of court in India. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, formally defines contempt.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish those found guilty of contempt.  Willful disobedience to court orders constitutes civil contempt.  Acts that scandalize or undermine the authority of the court are considered criminal contempt.  These statements correctly reflect the legal definition and scope of contempt of court.


22. Consider the following regarding "Zero FIR":

1.  It is registered irrespective of the place where the offense occurred.
2.  It is transferred to the appropriate police station for investigation.
3.  It provides a regular FIR number immediately.
4.  Its provision is under Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the features of a "Zero FIR"?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. A Zero FIR is registered regardless of the location of the crime, making it easier for victims to report incidents. It's then transferred to the relevant police station for investigation.  Section 531(1) of the BNSS, 2023, provides the legal basis for Zero FIRs. Statement 3 is incorrect.  A Zero FIR does *not* have a regular FIR number initially; a new FIR number is assigned by the appropriate police station after the transfer.


23. Consider the following about the doctrine of coverture:

1.  It's a legal doctrine stemming from English common law.
2.  It treats a married woman as a single entity with her husband.
3.  It completely suspends a woman's legal existence after marriage.
4.  It is still a fully operative legal principle in India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the doctrine of coverture and its relevance to modern Indian law?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The doctrine of coverture originated in English common law. It treated a married woman as legally subsumed under her husband.  It essentially suspended her independent legal existence.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the doctrine of coverture has historical roots, it is *not* fully operative in modern Indian law.  Indian law has largely moved away from this outdated principle, recognizing women's independent legal rights.


24. Consider the following regarding the doctrine of harmonious construction:

1.  It involves interpreting multiple legal provisions consistently.
2.  It is often used to resolve conflicts between different laws.
3.  It is a discretionary power of courts to extend time limits.
4.  It is mentioned in Section 3 and 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the doctrine of harmonious construction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The doctrine of harmonious construction seeks to interpret laws in a way that avoids contradictions and maintains consistency among different legal provisions.  Courts frequently employ this doctrine to resolve conflicts between seemingly opposing laws.  The notion of condonation of delay, often associated with harmonious construction, involves the court's discretionary power to extend time limits under specific circumstances.  Statement 4 is partially correct, in that it mentions the context in which the doctrine may be applied, but does not define the doctrine itself. The doctrine is not explicitly mentioned in Section 3 and 5, but may be applied in interpreting these sections.  The other three statements correctly describe the core elements of the doctrine.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC's headquarters are located in Mumbai.
2. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the Chief Justice of India.
3. The NHRC has the power to summon witnesses and examine them under oath.
4. The NHRC's primary function is to promote and protect human rights in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including summoning witnesses and examining them under oath.  This power is crucial for its investigative mandate. Statement 4 is partially correct. While the NHRC promotes and protects human rights, its foundation lies in the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and the Indian Constitution, not solely the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  The Act defines human rights based on the Constitution and international covenants enforceable in Indian courts. Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC's headquarters are in New Delhi. Statement 2 is incorrect; the President of India appoints the Chairperson and members based on a committee's recommendation, not the Chief Justice.  The committee includes the Prime Minister, Home Minister, and leaders of opposition in both houses of Parliament.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Oath of Members of Parliament (MPs):**

1. The oath of office for MPs is administered by the President of India.
2. Article 99 of the Constitution deals with the penalties for MPs who sit in the House without taking the oath.
3.  The oath can be taken in any language recognized by the Indian Constitution.
4. An individual appointed as a minister can participate in parliamentary proceedings without taking the oath.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the oath is administered by the President or a designated person. Statement 2 is partially correct; Article 99 details the oath procedure, while Article 104 specifies the penalty for sitting without taking the oath. Statement 3 is correct; the oath can be administered in English or any of the 22 scheduled languages. Statement 4 is partially correct; an individual appointed as a minister *can* participate but cannot vote without taking the oath.  The statement's phrasing creates ambiguity, making it a plausible distractor.  The individual must be elected to Parliament to vote.


**3. Consider the following features of the Citizenship Act, 1955:**

1.  It allows for dual citizenship.
2.  It outlines five ways of acquiring citizenship, including naturalization and incorporation of territory.
3.  It was amended by the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2005.
4. It exclusively relies on the principle of *jus soli* for citizenship acquisition.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  The Citizenship Act, 1955, details five methods of acquiring citizenship: birth, descent, registration, naturalization, and incorporation of territory. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act does not permit dual citizenship. Statement 3 is incorrect; the relevant amendment was the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, not 2005.  The year is a key distractor, playing on similar-sounding dates. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Act does not exclusively rely on *jus soli* (right of the soil).  It also incorporates *jus sanguinis* (right of blood) and other methods.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1. The Election Commission of India (ECI) derives its authority to enforce the MCC from Article 325 of the Constitution.
2. The MCC is legally binding and violations are subject to criminal prosecution.
3. The MCC applies only to political parties and their candidates.
4. The MCC's applicability extends from the announcement of the election schedule until the announcement of results.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 4 is correct.  The MCC is in effect from the announcement of the election schedule until the declaration of results. This period is crucial to maintain fairness and level playing field.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the ECI's authority for election management stems from Article 324, not 325.  The article numbers are designed to be confusingly similar. Statement 2 is incorrect; the MCC lacks statutory backing and violations are not directly subject to criminal prosecution, although some actions may violate other laws.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the MCC also applies to the ruling government and government employees.


**5. Consider the following about the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act was enacted in October 2005.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Home Affairs is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.
3. The RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
4.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is a Public Authority under the RTI Act.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act was enacted in June 2005 and came into force in October 2005. The dates are close enough to be a good distractor. Statement 2 is incorrect; the coordinating agency is under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court ruled that the Office of the Chief Justice of India is a Public Authority, not the CAG.  The substitution of CAG for CJI is a subtle but significant difference.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the President to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
2.  ADCs have powers over subjects like forest management and land revenue collection.
3. The Sixth Schedule applies only to the state of Assam.
4. The PESA Act, 1996, applies to areas covered by the Sixth Schedule.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. ADCs established under the Sixth Schedule have considerable autonomy and powers over various subjects, including forest management and land revenue. Statement 1 is incorrect; it's the Governor, not the President, who has the power to create ADCs.  The difference in authority is crucial. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule applies to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Limiting it to only Assam is a misleading simplification. Statement 4 is incorrect; the PESA Act applies to Fifth Schedule areas, not Sixth Schedule areas.  The confusion between the Fifth and Sixth Schedules is a key distractor.


**7. Consider the following regarding the  Universal Postal Union (UPU):**

1. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
2. The Director General of Posts (DGPS) in India has the power to regulate postal charges.
3. The Indian Post Office is not liable for any losses incurred by users of its services.
4. The UPU was established in the 19th century.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The DGPS in India has the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services. Statement 1 is correct. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Post Office has limited liability, as specified in the relevant Act.  The statement is designed to be a misleading oversimplification. Statement 4 is partially correct;  the UPU's origins are in the 19th century, making it a plausible but not entirely accurate statement.  More precise details regarding the establishment date would be needed to definitively confirm this.


**8. Consider the following statements about the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL is located in Mumbai.
2.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3. iCAL is primarily focused on auditing central government bodies.
4. iCAL enhances the independence of local government auditors.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 4 are correct. iCAL aims to set global standards and enhance the independence of local government auditors. Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat.  The location is a crucial detail for factual recall. Statement 3 is incorrect; iCAL focuses on local governance bodies, not central government bodies.  The distinction is vital for understanding its mandate.





**1. Consider the following statements related to the President's powers:**

1.  The President can pardon sentences for offenses under both Union and State laws.
2.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, and commute death sentences.
3.  Mercy petitions can only be filed by individuals sentenced to life imprisonment.
4.  The President's power to grant mercy petitions is entirely discretionary and not subject to judicial review.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes death sentences.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President can pardon sentences for offenses under Union laws, Governors have the power to pardon sentences for offenses under State laws.  The jurisdiction is divided.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Mercy petitions can be filed by persons sentenced to death or imprisonment, not just life imprisonment.  The scope is broader than stated.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the power is discretionary, the Supreme Court can review decisions on mercy petitions if there are procedural irregularities or violations of fundamental rights. The President's decision is not completely unassailable.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in India:**

1.  A curative petition is the first constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed.
2.  The curative petition power of the Supreme Court stems from Article 142.
3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there is a violation of the principles of natural justice.
4.  The Rupa Ashok Hurra case established the concept of curative petitions.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last*, not the first, resort available to a litigant after all other avenues, including a review petition (under Article 137), have been exhausted. It is a final recourse.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent power under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice. This power allows the court to rectify its own errors.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While a violation of the principles of natural justice is a ground for filing a curative petition, it is not the only ground. Other grounds include a judge failing to disclose a conflict of interest, or a demonstrable apprehension of bias.  The grounds are broader.

Statement 4 is correct. The landmark case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.* shaped the contours of curative petitions in India, establishing its procedural framework and grounds for admissibility.


**3. Consider the following about Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are a state-sponsored scheme primarily funded by state governments.

3.  The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for the implementation of FTSCs.
4.  FTSCs are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid.


How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears the expenditure, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.  Their core objective is to ensure swift justice in rape and POCSO cases. The Department of Justice is the implementing agency.  And, importantly, FTSCs are integrated with the National Judicial Data Grid for efficient case management and data tracking.


**4. Consider the following regarding Zero FIRs:**

1.  A Zero FIR is registered only at the police station where the crime occurred.
2.  A Zero FIR is immediately assigned a regular FIR number.
3.  The provision for Zero FIRs is found in the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
4.  The concept of Zero FIR originated from the Justice Verma Committee recommendations.


Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A Zero FIR's defining characteristic is that it can be registered at *any* police station, regardless of where the crime took place. It is then transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction for investigation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A Zero FIR does *not* receive a regular FIR number initially.  A new FIR is registered by the relevant police station after the transfer.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The provision for Zero FIRs is found in the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, not the IPC.  The legal basis is a newer act.

Statement 4 is correct. The concept emerged from recommendations made by the Justice Verma Committee following the 2012 Nirbhaya case.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Doctrine of Coverture:**

1.  The Doctrine of Coverture is a modern legal concept originating in India.
2.  Under this doctrine, a married woman's legal existence is suspended.
3.  The doctrine is directly relevant to the Marital Rape Exception in Indian law.
4.  The doctrine grants married women significant property rights.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 2 and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture is an archaic legal concept originating in English common law, not a modern Indian concept. It is a historical legal principle.

Statement 2 is correct.  Under this doctrine, a married woman's legal identity was subsumed under her husband's, effectively suspending her separate legal existence.  It was a significant limitation on women's rights.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court has recognized that the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) in Indian law stems from this historical doctrine, highlighting its continued relevance in legal debates.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The doctrine did *not* grant married women property rights; rather, it severely restricted them, transferring most property rights to the husband.  It was a significant impediment to women's economic independence.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:**

1.  It mandates that conflicting laws be interpreted to eliminate one entirely.
2.  Its origins can be traced to the *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India* case.
3.  It requires courts to prioritize newer laws over older ones regardless of context.
4.  It is primarily concerned with resolving conflicts between constitutional provisions and ordinary laws.

Which statement(s) accurately describe(s) the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction aims to *reconcile* conflicting laws, not to eliminate one. The goal is to find a mutually compatible interpretation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The origins of this doctrine can indeed be traced back to the *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India* case, where the court sought to harmonize seemingly conflicting provisions of the Constitution.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While newer laws might sometimes take precedence, the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction doesn't mandate this universally.  Context and the specific provisions involved are crucial.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While it often applies to constitutional provisions, the doctrine is applicable to resolving conflicts between any laws, including ordinary statutes, not just constitutional provisions and ordinary laws.


**7. Consider the following regarding the three new criminal laws enacted in 2023 and effective from July 1st, 2024:**

1.  They replace the Indian Penal Code (IPC) of 1860.
2.  They introduce community service as a punishment for petty offenses.
3.  They retain the offense of sedition.
4.  They raise the age of a gang rape victim classified as a major to 18 years.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The new laws replace the IPC, 1860.  This is a major legal reform.

Statement 2 is correct.  The new laws introduce community service as a sentencing option for less serious offenses. This is a significant change in criminal justice practices.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The new laws *remove* the offense of sedition, replacing it with other provisions addressing secessionist activities and threats to national unity and integrity.  This represents a shift in legal approach.

Statement 4 is correct. The age threshold for a gang rape victim to be classified as a major has been increased to 18 years.  This reflects a greater focus on protecting children and adolescents.


**8.  Consider the following regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1.  Cantonments are exclusively for military personnel.
2.  The first cantonment was established after Indian Independence.
3.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
4.  The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the State Government.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments house both military and civilian populations.  It is a mixed community.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first cantonment was established by the East India Company well before independence.  Barrackpore is a historically significant example.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments.  This is the primary legal framework.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The administration of cantonments falls under the Union List (Entry 3), making it a subject matter of the Union Government, not the State Government.  This reflects the national security implications.


**9. Consider the following concerning the Supreme Court's recent judgment on the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change:**

1.  The judgment explicitly mentions Article 21 but not Article 14.
2.  The judgment was made in a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard.
3.  The judgment establishes a new fundamental right independent of Articles 14 and 21.
4.  The judgment directly relates to the *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* case.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment explicitly connects the right to a healthy environment to both Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life). It uses these existing articles to widen their scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The judgment was indeed part of a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, highlighting the environmental context.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The judgment does not establish a wholly new fundamental right; instead, it interprets existing rights (Articles 14 and 21) to include protection from climate change's adverse effects.

Statement 4 is correct. The judgment is directly linked to the writ petition *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others*.  The case name is explicitly mentioned in the source material.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although primarily issued to Indian citizens, the central government can issue diplomatic passports to non-citizens in the public interest, as per the Passports Act, 1967.  The rule has exceptions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The validity period can be five years or less, not a fixed five-year term. It depends on various factors.

Statement 3 is correct. Holders of diplomatic passports are entitled to certain privileges and immunities, including immunity from arrest and legal proceedings in some circumstances, according to international law. This is a key feature.

Statement 4 is correct.  India has visa waiver agreements with Germany and several other countries for holders of diplomatic passports, allowing visa-free entry for a specified period.  This facilitates diplomatic travel.

1.  CSC SPV is a private company established under the Companies Act, 1956.
2.  CSCs are primarily focused on delivering services to urban citizens.

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CSC SPV is a special purpose vehicle established by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956.  It is a crucial implementing entity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSCs are primarily aimed at providing services to rural citizens, bridging the digital divide.  The focus is on rural areas.

Statement 3 is correct. CSCs are indeed one of three pillars of the NeGP, alongside connectivity and national data banks/state data centers.  It is a key component of the digital infrastructure.

Statement 4 is incorrect. CSCs offer a range of services, including G2C, business-to-consumer (B2C), and financial services.  The scope is broader than only G2C.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Section 6A was indeed added through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, which was in furtherance of the Assam Accord.  The legislative history is correct.

Statement 3 is correct. The amendments are directly related to the Assam Accord, a memorandum of settlement aimed at resolving citizenship issues in Assam.  It has a direct link to this accord.

Statement 4 is correct. The Act, even with amendments, still prescribes five ways of acquiring citizenship: birth, descent, registration, naturalization, and incorporation of territory.  These five ways remain.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules came into force in June 2024, not July 2024. The date is slightly off.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules explicitly provide for venue-in-charges to take action, including filing FIRs, if there's a prima facie case of unfair means in public examinations.  This is a key aspect of the rules.

Statement 3 is correct.  The rules stipulate the constitution of a committee by the public examination authority if the management or board of directors of a service provider is involved.  This addresses potential conflicts of interest.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Union Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions notified these rules, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The responsible ministry is different.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act allows the transfer of personal data outside India, except to countries specifically restricted by the government.  There are exceptions to the general rule.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act specifically restricts processing that could detrimentally affect a child's well-being, including tracking and targeted advertising.  Child protection is a key feature.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Act does indeed lay down significant penalties for various data protection violations, with higher penalties for offenses concerning children's data.  This reflects the seriousness of such breaches.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act amends and consolidates existing laws; it doesn't completely override all previous data protection frameworks.  It builds upon existing legal structures.



**1. Consider the following aspects of the Lok Sabha Secretariat and the Rajya Sabha Secretariat:**

1.  Ultimate administrative control
2.  Administrative head's designation
3.  Recruitment and service conditions governance
4.  Rules governing recruitment and service conditions promulgation authority

How many of the above-mentioned aspects are identical in both the Lok Sabha Secretariat and the Rajya Sabha Secretariat?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Both the Lok Sabha Secretariat and the Rajya Sabha Secretariat share similarities in their administrative structures. The administrative head in both is the Secretary General.  However, while both secretariats have their recruitment and service conditions governed by rules, these rules are promulgated by different authorities – the Speaker for the Lok Sabha and the Chairman for the Rajya Sabha.  The ultimate administrative control also rests with different individuals: the Speaker for the Lok Sabha and the Chairman for the Rajya Sabha. Therefore, only two aspects – the designation of the administrative head and the fact that recruitment and service conditions are governed by rules – are identical in both secretariats.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they overstate or understate the degree of similarity between the two secretariats.


**2. Consider the following regarding the President's address to Parliament:**

1.  The constitutional article permitting the President to address either House individually or both Houses jointly.
2.  The constitutional article specifying instances where the President specifically addresses both Houses assembled together.
3.  The amendment that altered the mandatory nature of the President's address at the commencement of every session.
4.  The provision related to the President addressing Parliament established after a specific Government of India Act.

How many of the above-mentioned provisions relate directly to the President's address to the Parliament as enshrined in the Indian Constitution?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Articles 86 and 87 of the Constitution directly deal with the President's power to address Parliament. Article 86 grants the President the power to address either House or both Houses jointly, while Article 87 specifies the occasions for addressing both Houses together (beginning of the first session after each general election and the first session of each year). The first amendment to the Constitution modified Article 87, changing the mandatory address at the commencement of every session to the specified occasions mentioned above.  The establishment of the practice of the President addressing Parliament after the 1919 Government of India Act is a historical fact, not a constitutional provision. Therefore, only three of the mentioned provisions are directly related to constitutional provisions regarding the President's address to Parliament. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional basis of the President's address.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Election Commission of India (ECI) and electoral processes:**

1.  The article of the Constitution that empowers the ECI with superintendence, direction, and control over elections.
2.  The article of the Constitution that restricts judicial intervention in electoral processes, invoked by the ECI before the Supreme Court.
3.  The Act that governs the filing of election petitions to challenge the validity of elections.
4.  The specific section within the Act mentioned above that deals with the validity of elections and its challenges.

How many of the above are directly related to the legal framework governing elections in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Article 324 of the Constitution grants the Election Commission of India (ECI) the power of superintendence, direction, and control of elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, the President, and the Vice-President. Article 329(b) limits judicial intervention in electoral matters, allowing challenges only through election petitions. The Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA, 1951), specifically Section 80, deals with the validity of elections and their challenges through election petitions.  All four statements are directly related to the legal framework governing elections in India.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following regarding the composition and functions of Parliamentary Committees:**

1.  The article of the Constitution that grants Parliament the authority to regulate its procedure and conduct of business, impacting the functioning of Parliamentary Committees.
2.  The article of the Constitution that deals with the privileges of Members of Parliament (MPs), relevant to the powers of Parliamentary Committees.
3.  The year in which the Public Accounts Committee was first established.
4.  The number of members constituting the Public Accounts Committee.
5.  The primary function of the Estimates Committee.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Parliamentary Committees in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 118 of the Constitution empowers Parliament to make rules regulating its procedure and conduct of business, indirectly affecting the functioning of Parliamentary Committees. Article 105 deals with the privileges of MPs, which are relevant to the powers of these committees. The Public Accounts Committee was first established in 1921.  The committee comprises 22 members (15 from Lok Sabha and 7 from Rajya Sabha). The Estimates Committee's primary function is to suggest alternative policies to enhance administrative efficiency and examine the effective use of funds within the limits of policy implied in the estimates. All five statements accurately reflect aspects of Parliamentary Committees in India.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.



**5. Consider the following regarding the Cabinet Secretary of India:**

1.  The committee responsible for the appointment of the Cabinet Secretary.
2.  The rules administered by the Cabinet Secretary.
3.  The key function of ensuring inter-ministerial coordination.
4.  The ex-officio position held by the Cabinet Secretary.
5.  The authority of the Cabinet Secretary over working departments.

How many of the above accurately describe the role and responsibilities of the Cabinet Secretary?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) appoints the Cabinet Secretary. The Cabinet Secretary administers the Government of India (Allocation of Business) Rules, 1961, and the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.  A key function is ensuring inter-ministerial coordination. The Cabinet Secretary is the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board (CSB).  However, the Cabinet Secretary has no direct authority over the working departments; they are considered *primus inter pares* among secretaries. Four of the statements accurately describe the role and responsibilities of the Cabinet Secretary.  Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**6. Consider the following concerning the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for elections:**

1.  The authority that lays down the MCC guidelines.
2.  The constitutional article providing the basis for the ECI's authority over elections.
3.  The period of applicability of the MCC.
4.  The legal consequences of violating the MCC.
5.  The scope of applicability of the MCC.


How many of the above accurately describe the Model Code of Conduct?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Election Commission of India (ECI) lays down the guidelines for the MCC. Article 324 of the Constitution empowers the ECI. The MCC is applicable from the announcement of the election schedule until the declaration of results.  Violations of the MCC, lacking statutory backing, are not directly prosecutable, but some provisions are enforceable through related statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951. The MCC applies to political parties, candidates, polling agents, the government in power, and government employees. Four of the above statements accurately describe the Model Code of Conduct; therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Lok Sabha:**

1.  The normal duration of the Lok Sabha's term.
2.  The authority empowered to dissolve the Lok Sabha prematurely.
3.  The possibility of extending the Lok Sabha's term under specific circumstances.
4.  The constitutional articles dealing with provisions related to elections.
5.  The electoral system employed for Lok Sabha elections.

How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of the Lok Sabha?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The normal term of the Lok Sabha is five years. The President can dissolve it prematurely.  The Lok Sabha's term can be extended during a national emergency. Articles 324 to 329 of the Constitution deal with election provisions. Lok Sabha elections utilize a territorial representation system with single-member constituencies.  All five statements correctly describe aspects of the Lok Sabha; thus, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  The constitutional article under which the Sixth Schedule is enacted.
2.  The body empowered to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
3.  The subject areas on which ADCs and ARCs can make laws.
4.  The number of members typically constituting an ADC.
5.  The committee whose recommendations led to the Sixth Schedule's creation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe features of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 244(2) of the Constitution provides for the Sixth Schedule. The Governor creates ADCs and ARCs. ADCs and ARCs can legislate on subjects like forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, and social customs. An ADC typically has up to 30 members. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations resulted in the Sixth Schedule.  All five statements accurately describe features of the Sixth Schedule. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**9. Consider the following regarding the procedure for the formation of new states in India:**

1.  The constitutional article that governs the formation of new states.
2.  The entity that holds the power to form a new state.
3.  The requirement for introducing a bill related to state formation in Parliament.
4.  The specific action required for altering the boundaries of existing states.
5.  The process for uniting parts of states to form a new entity.

How many of the above accurately reflect the constitutional procedure for forming new states?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Constitution governs the formation of new states. Parliament possesses the power to form new states. A bill for state formation requires the President's recommendation before introduction in Parliament.  The procedure for altering boundaries or names of existing states also falls under Article 3.  The process for uniting parts of states or uniting territories with parts of states also follows the provisions of Article 3. All five statements accurately reflect the constitutional procedure for forming new states. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**10. Consider the following regarding the oath-taking ceremony of Members of Parliament (MPs):**

1.  The constitutional article that deals with the oaths of office for MPs.
2.  The authority before whom MPs subscribe to their oaths.
3.  The schedule of the Constitution that provides the forms of oaths.
4.  The penalty for an MP sitting in the House without taking the oath.
5.  The exception to the oath-taking requirement for individuals becoming ministers.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the oath-taking process for MPs?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 99 deals with the oaths of office for MPs.  MPs subscribe to their oaths before the President or a person appointed by the President. The Third Schedule of the Constitution provides the forms of oaths.  There's a penalty for an MP sitting in the House without taking the oath.  An individual can become a minister without being elected to Parliament and can participate in House proceedings (without voting rights) without taking the oath.  All five statements accurately describe the oath-taking process for MPs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are designated as Protected Areas.
3.  Sikkim is wholly a Protected Area.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area. Statement 2 is also correct as mentioned in the provided text. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While parts of Sikkim are designated as Protected Areas, other parts are designated as Restricted Areas. Therefore, Sikkim is not wholly a Protected Area. Statement 4 is correct: The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as Restricted Areas.  Thus, only two statements (1 and 4) are entirely accurate.  The other options are incorrect because they either overstate or understate the number of correct statements. Option (a) is incorrect as more than one statement is correct. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect because they include inaccurate statements.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading statements.


**2. Consider the following aspects of India's Fiscal Federalism:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the tax bases between the Union and States.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Centre, but wholly assigned to States, are governed by Article 268.
3.  The distribution of GST revenue between the Centre and States is determined solely by the Finance Commission.
4.  The Union government's power to borrow money, both domestically and internationally, is enshrined in Article 292.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the constitutional provisions defining India's Fiscal Federalism arrangement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Seventh Schedule indeed delineates the tax bases. Statement 2 is also correct; Article 268 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to states.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission plays a crucial role, the distribution of GST revenue is determined by the GST Council, not solely by the Finance Commission.  Article 269-A is relevant here. Statement 4 is partially correct: Article 292 grants the Union the power to borrow domestically and internationally. However, Article 293 deals with state borrowing, not the Union government's borrowing powers.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are entirely accurate. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the constitutional provisions related to India's fiscal federalism. The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge of the subject.


**3. Consider the following regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1.  Cantonments are primarily dedicated to housing military personnel only.
2.  The first Cantonment was established in Barrackpore (Calcutta) in 1775.
3.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning Cantonment Boards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cantonments primarily house military troops, they also comprise civilian populations. Statement 2 is incorrect; the first cantonment was established in 1765, not 1775. Statement 3 is correct: The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of Cantonment Boards, aligning with the principles of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. Statement 4 is correct: The Station Commander holds the ex-officio presidency of the Cantonment Board. Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.  This question tests detailed knowledge about the administrative structure and history of Cantonment Boards in India.

3.  The judgment significantly expanded the scope of Article 19 of the Constitution.
4.  The judgment highlighted the interrelation between Articles 14 and 21 in the context of environmental protection.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The judgment recognized the right to a healthy environment under both Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life). Statement 2 is correct; the judgment was indeed related to the Great Indian Bustard case. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the judgment broadened the interpretation of fundamental rights, it primarily focused on Articles 14 and 21, not Article 19. Statement 4 is correct. The judgment linked Articles 14 and 21, emphasizing the right to a healthy environment as integral to the right to life and equality.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the essence of the Supreme Court's judgment.  This question assesses comprehension of a significant legal judgment and its implications for environmental law and fundamental rights.  The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate details to increase difficulty.


**5. Consider the following features of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:**

How many of the above features accurately describe the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The cut-off date for entry into India is December 31, 2014, not 2015.  Statement 2 is correct; the CAA exempts the specified migrants from the penal consequences of the Passport Act. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The naturalization period is reduced to 5 years, not 6 years. Statement 4 is correct: The Act does provide for the cancellation of OCI registration on five grounds.  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 4) are fully accurate. This question tests detailed knowledge of the CAA, 2019, and its provisions.  The options include closely related but inaccurate information to challenge the candidate's precise understanding.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the provisions related to the distribution of financial resources between the Union and States in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool, while horizontal devolution refers to the distribution among states based on various criteria. Statement 2 is incorrect for the same reason. Statement 3 is correct: Article 275 provides for grants-in-aid. Statement 4 is correct: Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission's role. Therefore, only three statements (3 and 4) accurately describe the provisions. This question aims to test the understanding of the terminology and the constitutional basis of financial resource distribution in India.  The incorrect options offer plausible but reversed definitions to increase the difficulty level.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The Constitution explicitly mentions the provision for granting Special Category Status to States.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Special Category Status (SCS) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution does not explicitly provide for SCS. Statement 2 is correct: The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used for grants to SCS States. Statement 3 is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS. Statement 4 is correct: The current funding pattern is based on the recommendations of the Chief Ministers' Sub-Group. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are accurate.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the provisions of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule applies only to specific states (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram). Statement 2 is correct; this reflects the composition of ADCs. Statement 3 is correct. ADCs and ARCs have powers to make laws on many subjects and to collect revenue and royalties. Statement 4 is incorrect. The PESA Act applies to Scheduled Areas, which are different from Sixth Schedule areas. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are fully accurate.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and its differences from other constitutional provisions related to tribal areas.  The distractors include plausible but incorrect details regarding the scope and applicability of the Sixth Schedule.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 3 allows for various methods of state formation, including uniting states or parts of states. Statement 2 is correct.  The President's recommendation is mandatory before introducing such a bill. Statement 3 is incorrect. While consultations with the affected states are important, the Parliament has the final authority. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's role is limited to adjudicating any legal challenges, not providing final approval.  Therefore, only two statements (2) are entirely accurate. This question assesses understanding of the constitutional process of state formation, highlighting the roles of different bodies. The incorrect options provide plausible but inaccurate details to increase the difficulty.


**10. Consider the following regarding Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSC SPV is set up under the Companies Act, 1956, not the IT Act, 2000.  Statement 2 is correct; CSCs are a key component of the NeGP. Statement 3 is incorrect; CSCs primarily serve rural citizens. Statement 4 is incorrect; CSCs offer G2C, B2C, and financial services. Therefore, only one statement (2) is fully accurate.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.  Statement 2 is also correct: Parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are indeed designated as Protected Areas. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While Sikkim has Protected Areas, it's not entirely designated as such; parts are also classified as Restricted Areas.  Statement 4 is correct: The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as a Restricted Area. Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.  The question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the geographical classification of these areas, highlighting the difference between "Protected" and "Restricted" designations and the partial nature of Protected Area status in some states. The incorrect options aim to mislead by including partially true statements, testing the candidates' ability to discern complete accuracy.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions defining India's Fiscal Federalism arrangement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Seventh Schedule indeed delineates the tax bases. Statement 2 is partially incorrect; Article 269, not 268, deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but wholly assigned to states.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Article 269A deals with the levy and collection of GST in interstate trade, not Article 270-A which doesn't exist. Statement 4 is partially correct: Article 270 does govern the distribution of certain Union taxes, but the phrasing is slightly inaccurate as it omits the crucial role of the Finance Commission's recommendations.  Therefore, only three statements contain elements of truth, though not entirely accurate in their phrasing or article numbers.  The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional articles related to fiscal federalism and their ability to identify subtle inaccuracies within seemingly correct statements.  The distractors are designed to exploit common misconceptions and partial knowledge of this complex subject.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: Cantonments house both military and civilian populations; a military station is exclusively for military personnel. Statement 2 is incorrect: While established by the East India Company after the Battle of Plassey, Barrackpore was established in 1765, not 1757. Statement 3 is correct:  Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. Statement 4 is correct: The Ministry of Defence retains administrative control. Thus, only three statements contain correct information, albeit with inaccuracies in specific details like dates and precise definitions. The question is designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of Cantonment Boards, requiring them to identify subtle inaccuracies within otherwise plausible statements.  This tests both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts.

Statement 3 is correct: The court did expand the interpretation of these articles to encompass environmental concerns. Statement 4 is incorrect: While the judgment touched upon related rights, Article 19 wasn't a central focus. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the judgment. The question tests the candidate's understanding of judicial pronouncements on environmental rights and their connection to fundamental rights. The distractors focus on the nuances of the judgment, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between implicit and explicit constitutional guarantees and the specific articles involved.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Special Category Status (SCS) in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: SCS was first introduced in 1969, not 1979, based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Sixth. Statement 2 is correct: J&K, Assam, and Nagaland were among the first recipients. Statement 3 is correct:  The purpose of SCS aligns with this description. Statement 4 is correct: Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have indeed made such demands.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Gram Nyayalayas Act exempts certain states and tribal areas. Statement 2 is correct: They are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class. Statement 3 is incorrect: They possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction. Statement 4 is incorrect: They are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, but by principles of natural justice.  Only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The question tests detailed knowledge of the Gram Nyayalaya system, including its jurisdictional limitations and procedural aspects.  The distractors are designed to confuse candidates with partially correct or misleading information about the scope and legal framework of these courts.


**7. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: Article 72 specifies that the President's power extends to offenses where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. Statement 2 is incorrect: The President's power extends to death sentences pronounced by any court, not just court-martials. Statement 3 is correct: Remission is indeed included within the President's power to commute sentences. Statement 4 is incorrect: Article 72 doesn't detail the procedural aspects of filing and adjudicating mercy petitions.  Only statements 2 and 3 contain elements of truth, though with some inaccuracies in their phrasing. The question is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions related to the President's powers, requiring an understanding of the scope and limitations of these powers.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s precise understanding of the article’s meaning.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  Curative petitions are indeed the last resort after review petitions are dismissed. Statement 2 is correct: Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice. Statement 3 is partially incorrect: While violation of natural justice is a ground, other grounds like non-disclosure of connections or apprehension of bias can also be valid reasons.

Therefore, three statements are largely correct, though one requires a nuanced understanding of the grounds for filing a curative petition. The question tests knowledge of the extraordinary legal remedy of a curative petition, its constitutional basis, and the circumstances under which it can be invoked.  The distractors play on the limited circumstances under which curative petitions can be filed.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, with the Centre bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.

Statement 4 is correct: The number of functional FTSCs, including ePOCSO courts, is indeed above 750. Therefore, three statements reflect the key characteristics of FTSCs, though one contains an inaccuracy regarding funding. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of a specific government initiative aimed at fast-tracking justice in sensitive cases.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate’s knowledge of the scheme’s specifics.

Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test a range of cognitive skills, particularly factual recall and analytical abilities.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.


**1. Consider the following aspects of India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The share of states from the divisible pool of taxes.
2.  The criteria used by the Finance Commission for horizontal devolution of funds among states.
3.  The constitutional provision governing grants-in-aid from the Union to states.
4.  The constitutional restrictions on states' borrowing powers.

Which of the above correctly reflect the constitutional and institutional framework governing India's fiscal federalism?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's fiscal federalism.  Statement 1 correctly points to the vertical devolution of resources, where a share of the divisible pool of taxes is allocated to states, a percentage determined by the Finance Commission.  Statement 2 correctly highlights that the Finance Commission employs multiple criteria (income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest cover, and tax effort) for horizontal devolution, distributing funds among states based on these factors.  Statement 3 correctly identifies Article 275 of the Indian Constitution as the basis for grants-in-aid from the Union government to states.  Finally, Statement 4 accurately reflects Article 292 and 293, which respectively grant the Union and states borrowing powers, with limitations on states' borrowing imposed if they are already indebted to the Union.  Therefore, option (d) is the most accurate answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one of these crucial elements.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as having SCS.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to allocate grants to SCS states.

4.  States granted SCS faced primarily geographical disadvantages.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for allocating funds to SCS states, and the 14th Finance Commission did recommend the discontinuation of the SCS framework. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution does not explicitly define SCS.  Statement 4 is an oversimplification; while geographical factors were a consideration, socio-economic disadvantages also played a significant role in granting SCS. Therefore, only three statements are correct, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to misinterpretations of the facts regarding SCS.


**3. Consider the following features related to the functioning of Common Service Centres (CSCs) in India:**

1.  CSCs are a key component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
2.  CSCs primarily serve urban populations.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of CSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. CSCs are indeed a crucial element of the NeGP.  Statement 2 is incorrect; CSCs are designed to serve rural populations. Statement 3 is false; CSC SPV is established under the Ministry of Electronics & IT. Statement 4 is also incorrect; CSCs provide a range of services, including G2C, business-to-citizen (B2C), and financial services.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate, making (a) the correct option.  Options (b), (c), and (d) misrepresent the facts surrounding the role and operation of CSCs in India.

3.  The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) operates independently of the CAG.
4.  The AuditOnline application was developed by the Ministry of Rural Development.

How many of these statements accurately describe the auditing mechanism for local bodies in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are largely correct. The CAG does oversee the audit of PRIs/ULBs, and the 73rd and 74th amendments laid the groundwork for increased accountability, although the online audit is a more recent development. However, statement 3 is incorrect; ELFA/DLFA operate under the CAG's supervision.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are largely correct. The Sixth Schedule does deal with the administration of tribal areas in specific states and mandates the formation of District Councils.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; it is based on the Bardoloi Committee’s recommendations, not the Dar Commission. Statement 3 is also incorrect; it applies only to specific states mentioned within the schedule itself, not all states with tribal populations.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The other options misrepresent key aspects of the Sixth Schedule's provisions.


**6. Consider the following regarding the powers of the Union government concerning the postal system in India:**

(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The Union government does have the power to intercept mail for national security reasons, and the East India Company did establish the first post offices. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the DGPS doesn't levy taxes but sets charges. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Indian Postal Act doesn't have extensive penal provisions.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are largely correct. The NHRC was indeed established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and while not explicitly constitutional, it's a statutory body with significant constitutional backing. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NHRC's accreditation is handled by GANHRI, not the UN Human Rights Council. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the NHRC's headquarters are in New Delhi.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct option. The other options contain inaccuracies about the establishment and functioning of the NHRC.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  All funding for CSSs is routed through the state's Consolidated Fund, and NITI Aayog plays a role in monitoring. However, statement 1 is incorrect; CSSs are primarily funded by the central government.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the current framework is based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the 15th Finance Commission.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate, making (c) the correct answer. The other options incorrectly describe the funding mechanisms and governance structure of CSSs.

However, statement 1 is incorrect; it operates across all three tiers of Panchayats. Statement 3 is also incorrect; it emphasizes inclusive participation, involving elected representatives, frontline workers, CBOs, and other stakeholders.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer. The other options misinterpret the participatory and multi-tiered nature of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SCS considers both geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. Statement 2 is correct:  The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations led to its introduction.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, significantly revises the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Statement 1 is correct as the Act explicitly addresses the admissibility of electronic and digital records, giving them the same legal standing as paper records.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Act allows for joint trials in situations where an accused has absconded or hasn't responded to an arrest warrant.  Statement 4 is accurate because it permits oral evidence to be given electronically, including witness statements made before courts. However, Statement 3 is inaccurate. While the Act does address timelines for certain procedures, it doesn't introduce universally stricter timelines across all investigative steps.  The Act focuses on streamlining processes, but the specific timelines aren't uniformly "stricter" than before. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


2. Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:

1.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data processing.

Statement 2 is also correct:  Consent is generally required for data processing, but the Act includes exceptions for legitimate purposes like government services or medical emergencies. Statement 3 accurately reflects the Act's provision granting data principals the right to access, correct, and even erase their personal data under certain conditions.  However, Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act's applicability is limited; it specifically excludes personal data processed for personal purposes and data already publicly available.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the Act's key features.

(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution grants the President of India the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences. Statement 1 is correct as the President can commute a death sentence to a lesser punishment. Statement 2 is accurate because the President's power extends to offenses against laws falling under the Union's executive power.  Statement 4 is also correct; the President can grant pardons in cases decided by court-martials. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The President's power concerning mercy petitions isn't limited to Supreme Court cases; it extends to sentences passed by various courts, including court-martials.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of curative petitions in the Supreme Court?

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Curative petitions represent the last resort for litigants whose review petitions have been rejected by the Supreme Court. Statement 1 is correct; it is the final constitutional remedy. Statement 2 is accurate as the Supreme Court's power to provide complete justice (Article 142) underpins its ability to hear curative petitions. Statement 4 is also correct; the Rupa Ashok Hurra case is the landmark judgment that shaped the process and guidelines for filing curative petitions. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While a curative petition can be filed based on various grounds such as violation of natural justice or apprehension of bias,  the presence of bribery is not the sole or mandatory criterion.  The grounds for a curative petition are broader. Therefore, three of the statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the FTSCs?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at ensuring the speedy disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases. Statement 1 is partially correct; the Nirbhaya Fund bears the expenditure, making it a central component of funding but not the exclusive source.  Statement 2 is accurate; FTSCs focus on cases under the POCSO Act and those involving rape. Statement 4 is also correct; the Department of Justice is responsible for the scheme's implementation. However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  While aiming for swift justice, FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, implemented across states/UTs, not solely a state-level initiative.  Therefore, three statements correctly describe the FTSCs.


6. Consider the following regarding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):

1. The CBI is a constitutional body.
2. The CBI Director's selection involves the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CBI is India's premier investigating agency. Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body. Statement 2 is correct; the selection process for the CBI Director involves the three mentioned entities. Statement 3 is also accurate; the CBI operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Statement 4 is incorrect; while combating corruption is a key aspect, the CBI's mandate extends to various economic and violent crimes, including cybercrime and high-technology crimes.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act, 2005, aims to promote transparency and accountability in governance. Statement 1 is correct; it replaced the earlier Freedom of Information Act. Statement 2 is accurate; the Supreme Court's ruling in the Raj Narayan case established the link between RTI and Article 19. Statement 4 is also correct; the Department of Personnel and Training plays a crucial role in implementing the Act. However, Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the RTI Act does have exemptions for national security information (under Section 8), it's not an absolute exemption; the specific details and context matter.  The disclosure or non-disclosure depends on a case-by-case assessment of whether releasing the information would jeopardize national security.  Therefore, three statements accurately represent aspects of the RTI Act.


8. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:

1. Aadhaar is an authoritative proof of date of birth.
2.  Aadhaar numbers are unique and linked to individual biometrics.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Aadhaar is a 12-digit unique identification number issued to residents of India. Statement 1 is incorrect; while Aadhaar can be *used* to establish identity, it is not considered definitive proof of date of birth by the Supreme Court.  Statement 2 is correct; Aadhaar numbers are unique and linked to biometric data to prevent duplication. Statement 3 is also correct; UIDAI is the issuing authority. Statement 4 is incorrect; UIDAI does have the power to deactivate or even cancel Aadhaar numbers under certain circumstances.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Aadhaar system.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The "right to be forgotten" is a complex legal concept. Statement 1 is incorrect; the RTBF is not an absolute right and is subject to limitations based on public interest and other considerations. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does not explicitly mention the "right to be forgotten" as a codified right. Statement 3 is correct; the concept has roots in French jurisprudence. Statement 4 is correct; the Supreme Court's Puttaswamy judgment recognized the RTBF as connected to the right to life and privacy under Article 21. Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the RTBF.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

ILPs are travel documents allowing access to specified areas in Northeast India. Statement 1 is incorrect; ILPs aren't required for all Indian citizens in protected areas; the requirement varies by location and purpose of visit.  Statement 2 is partially correct; border security is a factor, but the primary aim is also to protect tribal cultures. Statement 3 is incorrect; NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders are generally not eligible for standard ILPs and need different permits. Statement 4 is correct; the ILP system's origins trace back to the 1873 regulations. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the ILP system.



**1. Consider the following statements related to the President's power on mercy petitions:**

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes sentences awarded by court-martials and death sentences.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has the power to review the manner in which the executive exercises its powers, the President's decision on a mercy petition is generally considered final and not directly subject to judicial review.  The courts might intervene if there is a procedural lapse or violation of fundamental rights, but they cannot directly overturn the presidential pardon.  This is a crucial aspect of the President's discretionary powers in the context of the criminal justice system and reflects the balance of power between the executive and the judiciary.


**2. Consider the following regarding curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  A curative petition is the last resort available after a review petition is dismissed.
2.  The power to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 142.
3.  The grounds for a curative petition include violation of principles of natural justice and apprehension of bias.
4.  Curative petitions can be filed against any judgment of the Supreme Court.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. A curative petition is indeed the final legal recourse available to a litigant after all other remedies, including a review petition under Article 137, have been exhausted. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is rooted in its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice.  Valid grounds for a curative petition typically include the violation of principles of natural justice, a judge's failure to disclose a conflict of interest, and a demonstrable apprehension of bias that materially affected the judgment. However, statement 4 is incorrect. Curative petitions are not applicable to every Supreme Court judgment. They are available only in exceptional circumstances where there is a clear case of miscarriage of justice, and the grounds must be very compelling. The Supreme Court has been very restrictive in its approach to curative petitions, emphasizing their extraordinary nature.


**3. Consider the following features of the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  They are funded entirely by the state governments.
2.  Their primary objective is to expedite cases under the POCSO Act.
3.  They operate under the administrative control of the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
4.  The Nirbhaya Fund contributes to their funding.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. FTSCs are indeed designed to efficiently handle rape cases and those related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  The Nirbhaya Fund, established after the 2012 Delhi gang rape, plays a significant role in financing these courts.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, and the central government bears a substantial part of the expenditure.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the FTSCs fall under the administrative purview of the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  The distribution of responsibilities highlights the multi-faceted approach to addressing sexual violence and ensuring speedy justice.


**4. Consider the following provisions of the Post Office Act, 2023:**

1.  It repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
2.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) is empowered to regulate postal stamp pricing.
3.  The Act includes stringent penal provisions for misuse of postal services.
4.  The government has the power to intercept postal articles for reasons of national security.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, indeed replaces the older 1898 Act, modernizing postal regulations. The DGPS is granted authority over various aspects of postal services, including setting charges and managing stamp sales.  The government retains the power to intercept mail for reasons of national security, public order, and similar exigencies.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The 2023 Act, unlike some previous iterations, notably lacks detailed penal provisions for postal offenses. This reflects a shift in emphasis towards administrative rather than purely punitive measures for resolving postal-related disputes. The absence of strong penal clauses might be seen as a departure from traditional approaches to law enforcement within the postal system.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India:**

1.  It is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of India.
2.  Its accreditation by GANHRI has been deferred recently due to concerns about staff diversity.
3.  It is empowered to investigate human rights violations independently.
4.  It operates under the ambit of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The NHRC's recent deferral of accreditation by GANHRI is indeed linked to concerns regarding diversity and inclusivity within its staff and leadership.  The NHRC is a statutory body with investigative powers to look into human rights violations, and it operates under the framework of the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is not a constitutional body; it's a statutory body established by Parliament under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  This distinction highlights the difference between bodies whose existence and powers are directly enshrined in the Constitution and those created through legislation.  The statutory nature of the NHRC implies that its powers and functions are subject to parliamentary oversight and amendment.


**6. Consider the following aspects of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010 as amended:**

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is the implementing authority.
2.  NGOs must obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds.
3.  The Act allows for the unrestricted use of foreign contributions for administrative expenses.
4.  NGOs are required to maintain a designated FCRA account.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The MHA is responsible for implementing the FCRA, overseeing the registration and regulation of NGOs receiving foreign funds.  Prior permission is mandatory for receiving foreign contributions, and a designated FCRA account is required for managing these funds.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The FCRA, particularly post-2020 amendments, places restrictions on the use of foreign contributions, limiting the amount that can be used for administrative expenses (significantly reduced from the earlier 50%).  This control is aimed at ensuring that foreign funds are primarily used for the stated purposes of the receiving NGOs and to prevent misuse. The restrictions on the utilization of foreign funds emphasize the government’s commitment to regulating foreign influence on domestic NGOs.


**7. Consider the following related to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It grants special autonomy to certain tribal areas.
2.  It is applicable only to the Northeastern states.
3.  It was based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
4.  It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The Sixth Schedule is a unique feature of the Indian Constitution, providing for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils have significant administrative and legislative powers, reflecting the special constitutional arrangements made for the protection and empowerment of tribal communities in these regions. The Sixth Schedule is a direct outcome of the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, which aimed to address the unique needs and concerns of tribal populations in these areas.  While primarily associated with Northeastern states, the underlying principles could theoretically be applied elsewhere, but the practical applicability is limited to the specified areas.


**8. Consider the following about the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1.  It is a constitutional body.
2.  It investigates complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3.  It submits reports directly to the President of India.
4.  It is empowered to issue directions to the Central and State Governments.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution.  Its primary function is to investigate complaints relating to the safeguards and protections provided to Scheduled Castes.  The commission has the power to issue directions to both the Central and State Governments for remedial action. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The NCSC submits its reports to the Parliament, not directly to the President. While the President might receive copies or summaries of the reports, the primary accountability is to the legislature, reflecting the principle of parliamentary oversight over such constitutional bodies.  This arrangement emphasizes the legislative branch's role in monitoring the commission's activities and ensuring accountability.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC):**

1.  It is responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination.
2.  Its members are appointed by the President of India.
3.  It is a constitutional body.
4.  It advises the government on matters related to recruitment and promotions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Constitution, entrusted with conducting the Civil Services Examination and other examinations for recruitment to various central government services.  The President appoints the members of the commission.  A critical function of the UPSC is to advise the government on matters relating to recruitment policies, methods, and promotion procedures within the civil services, ensuring merit and transparency in the selection process.  The constitutional mandate of the UPSC underscores its importance in maintaining the integrity and impartiality of the civil services.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

1.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI).
2.  It grants individuals the right to data portability.
3.  It mandates data localization.
4.  It exempts certain government agencies from some of its provisions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Act establishes the DPBI to oversee data protection, and individuals have the right to access and port their data.  The Act also provides exemptions for certain governmental agencies, particularly those involved in national security and public order, reflecting the need to balance individual rights with national interests.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Act does *not* mandate data localization; it focuses on the protection of personal data regardless of its location.  This decision reflects a recognition that data localization could hinder international data flows and potentially harm economic competitiveness.  The focus on data protection principles rather than localization is a significant feature of the Act, distinguishing it from some other data protection laws globally.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's powers related to mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
2.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
4.  The President can reject a mercy petition without providing reasons.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute death sentences.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Article 72's scope extends beyond offenses solely under the Union's executive power; it includes court-martial sentences as well. Statement 3 is incorrect; while there's judicial review of *related* processes, the President's decision itself isn't directly reviewable.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while the President isn't bound to give detailed reasons, a complete lack of explanation could be legally challenged in certain circumstances. Thus, only two statements (2 and a modified version of 4 implying some level of justification) are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding curative petitions in the Supreme Court:**

1.  A curative petition is the final remedy available after a review petition under Article 137 is dismissed.
2.  The power to entertain curative petitions flows from the Supreme Court's inherent powers under Article 142.
3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there is a demonstrable violation of natural justice.
4.  The Supreme Court's decision on a curative petition is always final and binding.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition's rejection, and its basis lies in Article 142.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while violation of natural justice is a ground, other grounds like judge bias or apprehension of bias can also be valid. Statement 4 is incorrect; while practically final, there's a theoretical possibility of further legal action, though extremely rare.  Therefore, three statements are substantially correct.


**3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They are exclusively funded by state governments.
2. Their primary objective is to expedite cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
3. They are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid.
4.  The scheme is slated to end in 2026.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; FTSCs are centrally sponsored, with funding from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 2 is correct; expediting POCSO cases is a key goal. Statement 3 is correct;  they are indeed linked to the National Judicial Data Grid for improved data management and tracking. Statement 4 is correct; the scheme's extension confirms its continuation until 2026.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning internet shutdowns in India:**

1. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017, allows for indefinite shutdowns.
2.  The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, provides the legal framework for regulating internet services.
3.  The Supreme Court has held that internet shutdowns must comply with Article 19(2) of the Constitution.
4.  The Union Home Secretary alone has the authority to order internet shutdowns.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the 2017 rules allow only for temporary suspensions, not indefinite ones. Statement 2 is correct; the 1885 Act forms the basis for telecom service regulation, including internet. Statement 3 is correct; the Supreme Court's Anuradha Bhasin judgment emphasizes the need for compliance with Article 19(2). Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Union Home Secretary plays a crucial role, the 2017 Rules also involve state-level authorities and review committees. Therefore, three statements are substantially correct.


**5. Consider the following about the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991:**

1. The Act mandates the preservation of the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947.
2. The Act applies to all disputes related to the conversion of places of worship, regardless of their pendency.
3. The Ayodhya dispute is explicitly excluded from the Act's purview.
4.  The Act prescribes a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment for violations.


How many of the above statements are correct?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it existed on the specified date. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act specifically states that pending disputes as of August 15, 1947, are to abate. Statement 3 is correct; the Ayodhya dispute is a notable exception. Statement 4 is incorrect; the maximum penalty is three years' imprisonment, not five. Therefore, three statements are correct.



**6. Consider the following regarding preventive detention in India:**

1.  Preventive detention requires a prior conviction by a court of law.
2.  The Constitution permits both Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws on preventive detention.
3.  Article 22(3) removes the constitutional safeguards against arrest and detention in cases of preventive detention.
4.  Preventive detention is permissible only for offenses against national security.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; preventive detention is precisely about detention *without* prior conviction. Statement 2 is correct; both Parliament and state legislatures have the power to make such laws. Statement 3 is correct; Article 22(3) limits the application of fundamental rights in such cases. Statement 4 is incorrect; while national security is a common ground, preventive detention can be used for other reasons affecting public order.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**7.  Consider the following regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act was enacted in 2002.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the implementation of the RTI Act.
3.  The Act includes all government bodies and substantially funded NGOs as Public Authorities.
4.  The Central Information Commission's members are appointed by the Parliament.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the RTI Act was enacted in 2005, replacing the 2002 Freedom of Information Act. Statement 2 is correct; the Department of Personnel and Training plays a key role in its implementation. Statement 3 is correct; the Act's wide scope includes various governmental and substantially government-funded entities. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CIC members are appointed by the President on the recommendation of a specified committee. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following about Cantonment Boards in India:**

1. Cantonments are exclusively for military personnel.
2.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
3. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the State List.
4.  The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; cantonments house both military and civilian populations. Statement 2 is correct; the 2006 Act governs their administration. Statement 3 is incorrect; the administration of cantonments falls under the Union List. Statement 4 is correct; the Station Commander holds this ex-officio position.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding affirmative action in India and the USA:**

1.  Affirmative action is explicitly enshrined in the US Constitution.
2.  In India, affirmative action primarily aims to remedy historical discrimination against Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
3.  The US system of affirmative action is primarily based on a quota system.
4.  In India, there is no upper ceiling on reservations.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; affirmative action in the US is based on judicial interpretation of the 14th Amendment, not explicit constitutional provision. Statement 2 is correct;  it addresses historical injustices against marginalized communities. Statement 3 is incorrect; the US system focuses on diversity and inclusion rather than strict quotas. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court's Indra Sawhney judgment sets a 50% upper limit on reservations in India.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body.
2.  The NCSC's primary function is to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3.  The NCSC's recommendations are binding on the government.
4.  The Chairperson of the NCSC is appointed by the President of India.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while it's a statutory body with significant powers, it's not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Statement 2 is correct; investigating atrocities against Scheduled Castes is a core function. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NCSC's recommendations are not legally binding but carry significant weight. Statement 4 is correct; the President appoints the Chairperson.  Therefore, three statements are partially or fully correct.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences is enshrined in Article 72.
2.  This power extends to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial for offenses against laws related to matters under the Union's executive power.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
4.  The President's power extends to cases involving offenses against state laws only if the state government recommends it.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the punishment of any person convicted of any offense.  This power extends to sentences awarded by court-martials and for offenses against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends.  Crucially, it also includes the power to commute death sentences. Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect these provisions. However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the President's decision on a mercy petition is not directly subject to judicial review. While the Supreme Court can interpret the scope of Article 72, it cannot directly overturn the President's decision.  Statement 4 is also incorrect as the President's power is not contingent upon state government recommendations for offenses under Union laws.  The President's power is independent in such cases. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**2. Consider the following aspects of a curative petition in the Supreme Court:**

1.  It is the final legal recourse available after a review petition under Article 137 is dismissed.
2.  It is based on the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice.
3.  The grounds for a curative petition include violation of principles of natural justice and apprehension of bias.
4.  A curative petition can be filed only if the petitioner can demonstrate that the judgment was influenced by bribery.

How many of the above statements accurately describe a curative petition?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  This stems from the Supreme Court's power under Article 142 to ensure complete justice.  The grounds for a curative petition typically involve serious procedural irregularities, such as violations of natural justice, or a demonstrable lack of impartiality (apprehension of bias).  However, the requirement in statement 4, that the petitioner must prove bribery to file a curative petition, is incorrect.  While evidence of corruption might strengthen a curative petition, it is not a mandatory requirement.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the aspects of a curative petition, making (c) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  They are established under the Nirbhaya Fund.
2.  They primarily handle cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
3.  Their establishment is a centrally sponsored scheme.
4.  They are mandated to dispose of cases within a maximum of 60 days.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the FTSCs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs are indeed funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, making statement 1 correct.  They primarily deal with rape cases and those falling under the POCSO Act, making statement 2 correct.  The FTSC initiative is a centrally sponsored scheme implemented by the Department of Justice, making statement 3 also correct.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the objective is swift disposal, there is no fixed 60-day limit stipulated for all cases. The aim is efficient and timely resolution, but the timeframe can vary depending on the complexity of each case. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate, leading to option (a) as the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They function as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class.
3.  They are bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, in all proceedings.
4.  Their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters.

Which of the statements above are correct regarding Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, making statement 1 correct. They are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, making statement 2 correct.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While they follow principles of natural justice, they are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  Statement 4 is correct as their jurisdiction encompasses both civil and criminal cases, focusing on petty disputes at the village level.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making option (a) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court:**

1.  It is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders.
3.  Criminal contempt includes scandalous publications that prejudice judicial proceedings.
4.  The power to punish contempt rests solely with the Supreme Court.

Which of the above statements accurately describe contempt of court?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines contempt of court, making statement 1 correct. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, aligning with statement 2.  Criminal contempt encompasses publications that scandalize courts or interfere with judicial proceedings, as stated in statement 3.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has the power to punish contempt, this power also extends to High Courts under Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following statements about Cantonment Boards:**

1.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
2.  Their administration falls under the Union List.
3.  The Station Commander is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.
4.  They were initially established by the British East India Company.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding Cantonment Boards?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, making statement 1 correct.  Their administration is a subject of the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List), confirming statement 2.  The Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board, making statement 3 also correct.  Finally, statement 4 is also true; Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company. Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change:**

1. The judgment linked the right to a clean environment to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
2. The judgment was delivered in a case concerning the Great Indian Bustard.
3. The judgment mandated the government to immediately implement specific climate change mitigation measures.
4.  The judgment was based on the principle of intergenerational equity.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Supreme Court judgment?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court judgment did indeed link the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 (equality) and 21 (right to life), making statement 1 correct. The case did involve the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, making statement 2 also correct. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the judgment did not mandate immediate implementation of specific measures.  It acknowledged the right, but the specifics of implementation were left to the government. Statement 4 is correct, as the underlying principle of intergenerational equity (ensuring future generations have access to resources) likely influenced the court's reasoning.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**8. Consider the following statements about Special Category Status (SCS) for states:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  SCS states used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.
4.  The demand for SCS is often based on geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.


Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Special Category Status?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Constitution does *not* explicitly provide for the categorization of states as SCS states, making statement 1 incorrect.  SCS states did receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, making statement 2 correct.  The 14th Finance Commission, however, recommended the discontinuation of SCS, not its continuation, making statement 3 incorrect.  The demand for SCS is indeed often based on geographical and socio-economic challenges, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
2.  It applies only to states in Northeast India.
3.  ADCs have the power to make laws on matters like land revenue and forest management.
4.  The Sixth Schedule was based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Sixth Schedule does empower the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs, making statement 1 correct. It applies to specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, making statement 2 correct (although it's not limited to *all* Northeast states).  ADCs have extensive powers, including making laws on land revenue, forest management, and other matters, making statement 3 correct. The Sixth Schedule was indeed based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, all four statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the procedure for the formation of new states:**

1. The power to form new states rests with the Parliament.
2.  The President's recommendation is required for introducing a Bill related to state formation.
3.  The state legislatures concerned must approve the formation of a new state.
4.  A referendum in the affected areas is mandatory before state formation.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the procedure for the formation of new states?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 3 of the Constitution grants Parliament the power to form new states or alter existing ones, making statement 1 correct.  A Bill for this purpose can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's recommendation, making statement 2 correct.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the state legislatures do not have a formal approval power in this process.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; a referendum is not mandatory before state formation, although it might be politically advisable in certain circumstances.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**11. Consider the following regarding sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs):**

1.  The Supreme Court has permitted sub-classification of SCs for quota purposes.

Which of the above statements correctly describe the permissible sub-classification of Scheduled Castes?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court has indeed allowed sub-classification of SCs to address varying degrees of backwardness within the SC community, making statement 1 correct. Statement 2 is incorrect; sub-classification doesn't directly rely on Article 341(2) which deals with adding or removing castes from the SC list.  The goal of sub-classification is to achieve substantive equality by providing more targeted affirmative action, making statement 3 correct.  The state does need to justify sub-classification by demonstrating inadequate representation in state services, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Finance Commission does recommend the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union between the Union and the states, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; vertical devolution refers to the sharing between the Union and the states, not among states.  Horizontal devolution is indeed based on criteria like income distance, population, and area, making statement 3 correct.  Grants-in-aid are constitutionally provided under Article 275, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi focuses on competency-based capacity building, making statement 1 correct.  It advocates a shift from rule-based to role-based training, aligning with statement 2. Statement 3 is incorrect; while offline components might exist, the initiative heavily relies on online learning and the iGOT-Karmayogi platform, making statement 4 correct.

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The GRM guidelines mandate the appointment of nodal officers in ministries to handle grievances, making statement 1 correct.  Timelines are set for effective grievance redressal, making statement 2 correct.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while physical methods might be used, the emphasis is on efficient digital processes.  The GRAI is used for assessing and ranking ministries' performance in grievance redressal, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**15. Consider the following regarding the Tribunal system in India:**

1.  Tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies.
2.  The establishment of tribunals is solely based on the Constitution.
3.  The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) adjudicates disputes related to government employees' service conditions.
4.  Appeals from tribunals always lie with the High Courts.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Tribunal system in India?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Tribunals are indeed quasi-judicial bodies, making statement 1 correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; tribunals are established through acts of Parliament, not solely the Constitution.  The CAT does adjudicate service-related disputes for government employees, making statement 3 correct.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the appellate jurisdiction for tribunals varies depending on the specific law governing that tribunal; some appeals go to the High Courts, while others go to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect the regulations concerning Protected and Restricted Areas in India.  Statement 1 is correct as Arunachal Pradesh falls entirely within the designated Protected Area.  Statement 2 is also accurate; only portions of the mentioned states are included in Protected Areas, not their entirety.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the Andaman & Nicobar Islands as completely designated Restricted Areas under the 1963 order.  Finally, Statement 4 accurately describes the permit requirement for foreigners, with the exception granted to Bhutanese citizens.  Therefore, all four statements are true, making (d) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of accurate statements.


2. Consider the following aspects of India's fiscal federalism:

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the division of tax bases between the Union and States.

Statement 2 is incorrect: Article 269, not Article 270, deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to States. Article 270 pertains to the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States. Statement 3 is incorrect: While the Union Government has significant power, the distribution of revenue from taxes levied and collected by it is not solely determined by them.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in this process. Statement 4 is correct: Article 280 mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to recommend the distribution of resources between the Union and States.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate, making (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) include inaccurate statements about the constitutional provisions and the role of the Finance Commission.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Constitution does not explicitly mention SCS; it's a policy decision.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS, leading to its phasing out. Statement 4 is correct: Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were among the first states to receive SCS in 1969. Thus, only statements 2 and 4 are correct, making (b) the correct option. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the facts regarding the constitutional basis of SCS, the role of the Finance Commission, and the historical context of its implementation.

(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), originated from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. Statement 2 is correct: The primary purpose of the Sixth Schedule is to establish autonomous districts within specified states to protect the interests of tribal populations. Statement 3 is incorrect: The Sixth Schedule applies to specific states in the Northeast, not all of them.

(a) 2 and 4
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Cantonments Act, 2006, is implemented in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (relating to urban local bodies), not the 73rd (relating to Panchayats). Statement 2 is correct: The administration of cantonments is a subject of the Union List, under the Union Government's purview. Statement 3 is incorrect: Cantonment Boards serve both military and civilian populations residing within the cantonment area.

Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires detailed knowledge of Indian Polity and Governance.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power of mercy:**

1.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences but not to pardoning individuals convicted by a court-martial.
2.  Article 72 explicitly outlines the President's power to grant pardons only for offences against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
3.  The President's power of mercy can be exercised even if the Supreme Court has upheld the death sentence.
4.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is not judicially reviewable.

How many of the above statements are factually incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or in the case of an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of a State extends, where sentence is a sentence of death. This includes court-martial sentences.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Article 72 mentions offences against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power, it also includes cases where the sentence is death, irrespective of the nature of the offence.

Statement 3 is correct. The President's power of mercy can be exercised even after the Supreme Court has confirmed a death sentence.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the President's decision is largely discretionary, there have been instances where courts have examined the process and fairness of the decision-making, albeit indirectly.  A complete lack of judicial review isn't entirely accurate.  Therefore, three statements are factually incorrect.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in India:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The basis for the curative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court lies solely in its inherent powers under Article 142.
3.  A curative petition can be entertained only if the petitioner demonstrates a violation of principles of natural justice or apprehension of bias.
4.  The concept of a curative petition was established in the landmark case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the legal position on curative petitions?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort and can only be filed after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While Article 142 provides the underlying power, the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is also rooted in its inherent power to ensure justice and rectify errors. It's not solely based on Article 142.

Statement 3 is correct. The grounds for a curative petition primarily include violations of natural justice, non-disclosure of relevant information by judges, or a clear apprehension of bias leading to an adverse judgment.

Statement 4 is correct. The concept of curative petitions gained shape in the *Rupa Ashok Hurra* case, providing a mechanism for addressing exceptional circumstances where the review petition was insufficient.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the legal position.



**3. Consider the following statements about the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule exclusively applies to the four Northeastern states mentioned.

Statement 2 is correct. ADCs under the Sixth Schedule possess significant legislative and executive powers, including those related to land revenue, taxation, and mineral resources.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Governor nominates some members of the ADCs, the majority are elected.  The Chief Executive Member is also elected.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA) applies to Scheduled Areas under the Fifth Schedule, not the Sixth Schedule. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



**4. Consider the following statements related to the formation of new states in India:**

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, exempts certain states and tribal areas.  It's not applicable universally.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While they strive for conciliation, Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but guided by principles of natural justice.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session (criminal cases) and the District Court (civil cases).  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.

How many of the above statements are entirely correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 explicitly grant the power to punish for contempt.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately defines the distinction between civil and criminal contempt.

Statement 3 is correct. The 1971 Act comprehensively covers both types of contempt and the related procedures.

Statement 4 is partially correct. While the Attorney General can advise on contempt matters, they do not have the power to initiate proceedings independently. The power to initiate proceedings rests with the courts themselves.  Therefore, three statements are entirely correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF) in India:**

1.  The RTBF is an absolute right, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates the RTBF.
3.  The Supreme Court, in the *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy* case, recognized RTBF as a facet of the right to life under Article 21.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does not explicitly mention the RTBF.

Statement 3 is correct. The *Puttaswamy* judgment recognized the RTBF as part of the right to life and privacy.

Which of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ILPs are issued to Indian citizens as well, allowing them access to protected areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While environmental protection is a factor, the primary aim is to regulate movement in sensitive border areas and protect the cultural identity of tribal communities.

Statement 3 is correct. These four states utilize the ILP system.

Statement 4 is incorrect. NRIs, PIO cardholders, and OCI holders are not eligible for ILPs and need different permits. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect.


**9. Consider the following statements about Special Category States (SCS) in India:**

1.  The constitutional basis for designating states as SCS lies in Articles 370 and 371.
2.  SCS states used to receive central grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly define SCS; the designation arises from policy decisions and special provisions under various Articles (not just 370 and 371).

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for allocating central grants to SCS states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission recommended phasing out the SCS status and adopting a different funding mechanism.

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the 2002 Act.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The *Raj Narayan* case played a significant role in establishing the right to information, but the Supreme Court's ruling didn't explicitly frame it as a fundamental right under Article 19 in the same way that the RTI Act does.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Court rulings have varied on whether cooperative societies are public authorities; it's not a universal rule.

Statement 4 is correct. The President appoints CIC members based on a committee's recommendation, as described in the Act. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are entirely correct.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the Post Office Act, 2023:

1. It repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998.
2.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) will be appointed to head India Post.
3.  The Act prescribes stringent penal provisions for violations.
4. The DGPS will have the power to regulate charges for postal services.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the Post Office Act, 2023.  The Act indeed replaces the 1998 Act, establishes the DGPS as the head of India Post, and grants the DGPS regulatory power over service charges and the sale of postage stamps. However, statement 3 is incorrect. A crucial aspect of the 2023 Act is the *absence* of penal provisions.  This signifies a shift in approach compared to previous legislation, focusing instead on regulatory mechanisms and administrative oversight. The lack of penal clauses might be intended to streamline operations and allow for a more flexible response to violations through administrative means. This is a significant point for UPSC aspirants to understand, as it demonstrates a nuanced approach to governance and regulatory frameworks.  The absence of explicit penalties doesn't necessarily imply a lack of accountability; it could reflect a policy decision to prioritize alternative enforcement methods.


2. Consider the following regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part IV of the Constitution.
2.  The GANHRI's accreditation of the NHRCI was recently deferred due to concerns about staff diversity.
3.  The NHRC's headquarters are located in Mumbai.
4. The Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, established the NHRC.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The GANHRI's deferral of NHRCI accreditation, citing concerns about diversity and protection of marginalized groups, is a matter of recent record. The NHRC's establishment under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (and subsequent amendments) is also accurate.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a *statutory* body, not a constitutional one. This distinction is crucial in understanding its powers and limitations. While it plays a vital role in protecting human rights, its existence and powers are derived from legislation, not directly from the Constitution.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NHRC's headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  These details highlight the importance of precise factual knowledge for UPSC preparation.  The incorrect options reveal common misconceptions about the NHRC's legal basis and location.


3. Consider the following features of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), post-2020 amendments:

1.  NGOs must obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds, with mandatory Aadhaar submission.
2.  Funds received under the FCRA can be freely transferred to any other person or NGO.
3.  The validity of FCRA registration is ten years.
4.  A maximum of 50% of foreign contribution can be used for administrative expenses.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate prior permission for receiving foreign funds and require Aadhaar submission from all office-bearers of NGOs.  This reflects a stricter regulatory approach. Statement 2 is incorrect; funds received under the FCRA are strictly regulated and cannot be freely transferred.  A designated FCRA account is required, and transfers are limited.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the validity of FCRA registration is five years, not ten.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the permissible usage of foreign contribution for administrative expenses is now capped at 20%, not 50%.  The incorrect options represent common misunderstandings about the FCRA's restrictions and regulations, demonstrating the importance of precise knowledge of the Act's provisions for UPSC preparation.


4. Consider the following statements about the powers and functions of the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) under the Post Office Act, 2023:

1.  The DGPS can intercept postal articles under specific circumstances related to national security.
2.  The DGPS has the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services.
3.  The Post Office is liable for all losses incurred during the transmission of postal articles.
4. The DGPS is responsible for appointing all postal employees across India.

Which of the statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe powers vested in the DGPS. The government, not the DGPS directly, retains the power to intercept postal articles for reasons of national security or public order.  The DGPS does have authority to regulate postal service charges and the supply of postage stamps. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Post Office Act limits the liability of the post office, exempting it from responsibility except in cases specifically prescribed.  This limitation is a significant aspect of the Act and demonstrates a key feature of the regulatory framework.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the DGPS heads India Post, the appointment of all postal employees is not solely their responsibility.  There is a hierarchical structure within the postal service, and appointments are likely handled at various levels of the organization.  The incorrect options highlight potential misunderstandings about the scope of the DGPS's authority within the new legislative framework.


5. Consider the following statements related to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:

3.  The RTI Act guarantees the right to information only for Indian citizens.
4.  The Supreme Court has declared the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The RTI Act superseded the 2002 Act; the Department of Personnel and Training acts as the coordinating agency; and the Supreme Court, in the case of *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government*, linked the right to information to Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression). However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The RTI Act grants the right to information to all persons, not just Indian citizens. This is a significant aspect of the Act's scope and reflects its commitment to transparency and accountability.  The incorrect options illustrate potential misconceptions about the Act's reach and its constitutional underpinnings, underscoring the need for precise knowledge for UPSC preparation.  The correct answer requires a clear understanding of the RTI's key features and its relationship to other legal frameworks.

4.  Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were among the first states granted SCS.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, and Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were among the initial recipients of SCS. However, statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not contain a specific provision for the designation of states as SCS states.  The SCS was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of the SCS, not its continuation.  The incorrect options highlight common misunderstandings about the legal and historical context of the SCS, demonstrating the importance of nuanced understanding for UPSC preparation. The question tests understanding of the historical context and policy evolution of SCS, a frequently tested area in the UPSC exam.

4.  The Aadhaar number is a 16-digit unique identification number.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The UIDAI is indeed the issuing authority for Aadhaar cards.  Statement 1 is incorrect; each resident is assigned only one Aadhaar number, linked to their unique biometric data.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while Aadhaar can be used as *evidence* of date of birth, it is not considered authoritative proof.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Aadhaar number is a 12-digit unique identification number, not 16 digits.  The incorrect options demonstrate potential misconceptions about the Aadhaar system’s key features and its limitations.  The question tests factual knowledge of the Aadhaar system, a frequently discussed topic in the context of governance and technology.  The precise details of the Aadhaar number and its limitations are crucial for UPSC aspirants.

(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The NCSC does indeed investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes, and it submits its reports directly to the President.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament, not a constitutional body.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the NCSC's jurisdiction extends to a wide range of matters related to the welfare and protection of Scheduled Castes, not only employment.  The incorrect options reveal potential misunderstandings regarding the NCSC's legal standing and scope of authority.  The question tests factual knowledge about the NCSC, a crucial institution in the context of social justice and governance in India.  Accurate knowledge of its functions and reporting structure is vital for UPSC aspirants.

However, statement 3 is incorrect. The UPSC's recommendations on appointments are not binding on the government; the government can accept or reject them.  This crucial point underscores the balance of power between the UPSC and the executive branch.  The incorrect options represent potential misunderstandings of the UPSC's role and its relationship with the government. This question tests knowledge about the UPSC's constitutional status and its functions, a vital aspect of Indian polity for UPSC aspirants.  The precise understanding of its powers and limitations is crucial.

(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The CVC's primary function is indeed investigating corruption, and its jurisdiction extends to all central government employees.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act upheld its constitutionality while establishing crucial limitations.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the court mandated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.  Statement 3 is incorrect as the court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be forced for bank accounts or mobile/internet connections, although it is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes. Statement 4 is incorrect because the court explicitly prohibited the state from entering into contracts with private corporations for Aadhaar data sharing, citing infringement on the right to privacy. Statement 2 is directly contradicted by the Supreme Court's affirmation of the Act's constitutionality, implying that it does *not* violate the mentioned fundamental rights. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

Statement 4 is correct; the current framework is indeed based on the 2015 report. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


3. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CAA only applies to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians. Statement 2 is correct; it does reduce the naturalization period to 5 years for the specified categories. Statement 3 is incorrect; it does not grant automatic citizenship but provides a pathway for citizenship applications. Statement 4 is correct; the Act does empower the central government to cancel OCI registration under certain circumstances. Thus, only two statements accurately reflect the CAA.

(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Article 72 explicitly includes offences against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.  Statement 3 is incorrect as Article 72 covers sentences by court-martial and those for offences against Union laws.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Article 72 specifically mentions court-martial sentences. Statement 2 is correct; the President can commute death sentences. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.

How many of the statements above are correct concerning curative petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; a curative petition is the *last* resort, after a review petition has been dismissed. Statement 2 is correct; the curative power stems from Article 142. Statement 3 is partially correct; while violation of natural justice is a ground, other grounds, like undisclosed connections or apprehension of bias, also exist. Statement 4 is incorrect; the existence of other remedies doesn't render a curative petition irrelevant; it is the final option.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are partially correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution doesn't explicitly define criteria for SCS. Statement 2 is correct; this formula was used for grant allocation.

Statement 2 is partially correct; The Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023 amended section 8(1)(j) to exempt personal information, but not all information is exempt. Statement 3 is correct; the 2019 amendment granted this power to the Central Government. Statement 4 is incorrect; lower courts are generally barred from entertaining such suits.

1. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar:

1.  It captures details like caste, religion, income, health, and geography.
2.  It serves as proof of citizenship and domicile for Indian residents.
3.  Resident data is stored decentrally, with authentication possible only from the issuing location.
4.  It facilitates targeted delivery of government benefits and subsidies.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar's core design is to avoid capturing sensitive personal information like caste, religion, income, health, and precise geographical location to protect privacy.  While demographic details might be linked, the core database prioritizes a unique identifier without revealing such specifics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is explicitly not a proof of citizenship or domicile. It is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, but citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Aadhaar's architecture is designed for centralized data storage and online authentication from anywhere within the country, making it scalable and efficient for nationwide use. This centralized approach allows for quicker verification and benefit disbursement.

Statement 4 is correct. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates its use for accessing certain social welfare schemes funded from the Consolidated Fund of India or State Consolidated Funds, enabling targeted delivery of benefits.  This reduces leakages and ensures that subsidies reach the intended beneficiaries.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are incorrect.


2. Consider the following regarding the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):

1.  CSSs are funded solely by the central government.
2.  CSS implementation is exclusively through the central government's agencies.
3.  CSSs operate within sectors listed only in the Union List of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, reflecting a collaborative approach to development initiatives. The central government provides a significant portion of the funding, but state governments also contribute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are implemented through state governments, leveraging their on-the-ground expertise and understanding of local needs. The central government provides guidance and financial support, but execution rests primarily with the states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. CSSs operate in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution. This reflects the shared jurisdiction between central and state governments in various policy areas.

Statement 4 is correct. The current framework governing CSSs is rooted in the recommendations of the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, which aimed to streamline and improve the efficiency of these schemes. Thus, three statements are incorrect.


3. Consider the following regarding the acquisition of Indian citizenship:

1.  Knowledge of a language from the 8th Schedule is mandatory for citizenship by naturalization.
2.  Applicants can only provide a limited set of documents as proof of entry into India.
3.  Renunciation of another country's citizenship is not required for acquiring Indian citizenship.
4.  Applications for citizenship are submitted to the District Level Committee.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Adequate knowledge of a language listed in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution is a requirement for obtaining citizenship through naturalization. This ensures a basic level of integration with the linguistic landscape of India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rules allow for a range of documents to prove entry into India, including visas, residential permits, census slips, and Aadhaar cards, offering flexibility to applicants with varied documentation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Applicants must declare that their citizenship of another country will be irrevocably renounced if their application for Indian citizenship is approved. This prevents dual citizenship, which is not permitted under the Citizenship Act of 1955.

Statement 4 is partially correct. While applications are initially processed at the District Level Committee, the final decision rests with an Empowered Committee, as per Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955.  Therefore, two statements are incorrect.


4. Consider the following statements about the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:

1.  It applies to illegal migrants irrespective of their religious background.
2.  It applies to illegal migrants who entered India after December 31, 2014.
3.  It grants a reduced naturalization period for specified religious groups.
4.  It mandates the cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, specifically applies only to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians. This religious criterion is a key element of the Act and a source of significant debate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, applies to illegal migrants who entered India on or before December 31, 2014.  This cut-off date is crucial to its scope and application.

Statement 3 is correct. The CAA, 2019, reduces the naturalization period for the specified religious groups from 11 years to 5 years, making it easier for them to obtain citizenship.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The CAA provides grounds for the central government to cancel OCI registration, but it does not mandate such cancellation.  The power is discretionary, allowing for case-by-case evaluation. Thus, three statements are incorrect.


5. Consider the following regarding Gram Nyayalayas:

1.  They are established under the Village Courts Act, 2010.
2.  They are located at the headquarters of the district Panchayat.
3.  They are not bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
4.  Appeals from their decisions are heard by the High Court.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not a 2010 Act. This Act provides the legal framework for their establishment and functioning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are located at the headquarters of the *intermediate* Panchayat, not the district Panchayat.  This ensures accessibility at a more localized level.

Statement 3 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but they are guided by the principles of natural justice. This allows for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution.

Statement 4 is incorrect. In criminal cases, appeals lie to the Court of Session, and in civil cases, they lie to the district court, not the High Court.  This reflects the hierarchical structure of the judicial system.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


6. Consider the following regarding contempt of court:

1.  It is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1981.
2.  Only the Supreme Court has the power to punish for contempt.
3.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order.
4.  Criminal contempt includes interfering with the administration of justice.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Contempt of court is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not 1981.  This Act outlines the legal framework for dealing with contempt cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish for contempt, reflecting their respective jurisdictions.  This is enshrined in Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.

Statement 3 is correct. Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court, or a willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.

Statement 4 is correct. Criminal contempt includes actions that scandalize or lower the authority of any court, prejudice or interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding, or interfere with or obstruct the administration of justice.  Therefore, two statements are incorrect.


7. Consider the following statements regarding the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan):

1.  It aims to reduce people’s participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2.  It was launched under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" in 2018.
3.  It involves only elected representatives in the planning process.
4.  The prepared Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly aims to *accelerate* people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  This participatory approach is central to its design.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2018.  This reflects its inclusive approach to development planning.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The campaign involves a wide range of stakeholders beyond elected representatives, including government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other community members.

Statement 4 is correct.  Approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, ensuring transparency and public access to the plans.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


8. Consider the following regarding the Telecommunications Act, 2023:

1.  It retains the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
2.  Spectrum allocation is solely through administrative means.
3.  It establishes a new framework for Right of Way (RoW).
4.  It explicitly regulates Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, reflecting the significant technological advancements in the telecommunications sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Spectrum allocation is done through a combination of auction and administrative means.  While auctions are used for most spectrum, administrative allocation is retained for specific uses like national security and disaster management.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act introduces a new framework for RoW, aiming to streamline the process for infrastructure development and ensuring non-discriminatory access.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, does *not* regulate OTT platforms.  Their regulation remains a separate matter, potentially under consideration through other legislative frameworks. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


9. Consider the following regarding the Election Commission of India (ECI) and elections:

1.  EVMs were first used in Goa's Assembly elections in 2017.
2.  VVPATs were fully deployed in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.

4.  The MCC is a legally binding document.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Goa was the first state to use VVPATs with all EVMs during the 2017 Assembly elections. This was a significant step towards enhancing election transparency.

Statement 2 is correct. VVPATs were fully deployed across India during the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections to further increase voter confidence in the accuracy of the EVM system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960, during the Kerala state assembly elections, not 1970.  It was a gradual process of development and refinement.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the MCC is a crucial part of ensuring free and fair elections, it is not a legally binding document in a strict sense. It's a set of guidelines and principles based on consensus with political parties.  Therefore, two statements are incorrect.


10. Consider the following statements regarding the Indian Parliament:

1.  The President addresses both Houses of Parliament only at the beginning of the first session after each general election.
2.  Article 99 mandates that MPs must take an oath in English.
3.  A person can become a minister without being elected to Parliament.
4.  Article 104 provides a penalty for MPs who sit in the House without taking the oath.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President addresses both Houses of Parliament at the beginning of the first session after each general election *and* at the beginning of the first session of each year.  This is a regular constitutional requirement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While English is an option, MPs can take the oath in English or any of the 22 scheduled languages.  This reflects India's linguistic diversity.

Statement 3 is correct. A person can be appointed a minister without being elected to Parliament.  This person can participate in parliamentary proceedings but cannot vote.

Statement 4 is correct. Article 104 outlines a penalty for a member who sits in the House without taking the oath. This underscores the importance of adhering to constitutional procedures.  Therefore, three statements are incorrect.




1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:

1. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union.
2. Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among different states.
3. Grants-in-aid are provided to states based on Article 275 of the Constitution.
4. State governments can borrow money from international sources without the Union's consent.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission, established under Article 280, plays a crucial role in recommending the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States.  This includes taxes levied and collected by the Union, such as corporation tax and income tax, ensuring a balance of resources.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the States, not among the states themselves. Horizontal devolution addresses the distribution among states.

Statement 3 is correct.  Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance.  These grants are often given to states with weaker revenue bases or specific developmental challenges.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly states that a state government can only borrow within India, not internationally, and requires the Union government's consent if the state is already indebted to the Union.  This prevents states from accumulating unsustainable levels of debt.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


2. Consider the following aspects of Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1. SCS was first introduced based on the recommendations of the Tenth Finance Commission.
2. The Constitution explicitly includes provisions for categorizing states as SCS states.
3.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was previously used to determine grants for SCS states.
4.  Following the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, SCS ceased to exist.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Tenth. The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations were instrumental in establishing the initial framework for providing special assistance to states facing significant socio-economic and geographical challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain a specific provision for designating states as Special Category States.  The granting of SCS was a policy decision based on various factors assessed by the Finance Commissions.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was a key mechanism used to distribute funds to states with Special Category Status.  This formula considered various factors to allocate resources based on need and developmental priorities.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended discontinuing the system of Special Category Status.  This led to a shift in the approach to providing financial assistance to states, moving away from the SCS framework. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


3. Consider the following features of India's Sixth Schedule:

1. It was established based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It aims to provide special autonomy to certain tribal areas within Assam.
3. It grants the Union government direct control over the administration of scheduled areas.
4. It mandates the establishment of autonomous district councils in all states.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, enshrined in Article 244(2) of the Indian Constitution, resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee. The Bardoloi Committee's suggestions were crucial in shaping the structure and provisions of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The Sixth Schedule does provide for a degree of autonomy to certain tribal areas, primarily in the Northeastern states, aimed at preserving their distinct cultural identities and administrative practices.  However, its scope is not limited to Assam.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule establishes autonomous district councils with significant powers over their respective areas but does not grant the Union government direct control over the administration of scheduled areas.  The councils have considerable autonomy in matters of local governance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule applies only to specific states (primarily in the Northeast), and not all states have autonomous district councils under the Sixth Schedule.  Its application is geographically limited. Therefore, only statement 2 is partially correct, but considering the other options, (a) is the best choice due to the significant inaccuracies of other statements.


4. Consider the following regarding the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):

1. CSSs are solely funded by the central government.
2.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers.
3. CSSs primarily focus on schemes within the Union List of the Constitution.
4.  Following the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs became the primary mode of specific-purpose transfers from the Union to States.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, reflecting the cooperative nature of federal governance in India.  The sharing of financial responsibility is a key characteristic of CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct. The current structure and functioning of CSSs are largely based on the recommendations and report produced by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes in 2015.  This report played a pivotal role in shaping the current framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. CSSs operate in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.  This reflects the shared jurisdiction between the Union and States in many areas of governance and development.

Statement 4 is correct. Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs indeed became the dominant method for the Union government to provide specific-purpose grants to States, reflecting a significant change in fiscal federalism. Therefore, statements 2 and 4 are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Fifteenth Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool of taxes for the states, representing a significant portion of the central government's tax revenue allocated to states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Income distance is indeed one of the criteria used by the 15th Finance Commission for horizontal devolution.  This reflects the commission's attempt to address disparities in income levels across states.

Statement 3 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission did consider forest and ecology as a criterion for horizontal devolution, recognizing the importance of environmental factors and resource management.

Statement 4 is correct. Horizontal devolution specifically refers to the distribution of resources allocated to states among the states themselves, aiming for a more equitable distribution based on various criteria.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar is often required for accessing government services and benefits, the Supreme Court has ruled that it cannot be mandatorily linked to opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, but with certain safeguards to protect privacy rights.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Supreme Court ruling stipulated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for longer than six months, emphasizing the importance of data protection and preventing potential misuse of personal information.  Therefore, only statement 4 is correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
2.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
4.  A mercy petition can be filed only after all appeals in the judicial system have been exhausted.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 does cover offenses under the Union's executive power, it also explicitly includes offenses where the sentence is by a court-martial and those resulting in a death sentence.  The scope is broader than just Union-related offenses.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute sentences, including death sentences. This means changing the punishment to a less severe one.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court can review the *process* by which the President makes a decision (e.g., whether due process was followed), it cannot directly overturn the President's decision on a mercy petition. The President's power in this area is considered discretionary and largely beyond judicial review.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While it's typical for mercy petitions to be filed after exhausting judicial appeals, there's no constitutional requirement stating this explicitly.  The timing depends on the specific circumstances and the legal process.  Therefore, only statements 2 is correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in the Indian judicial system:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to hear curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142.
3.  A curative petition can be filed based on newly discovered evidence that was not available during the original trial.
4.  The grounds for a curative petition include allegations of bias against a judge.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the final legal recourse available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  It's a last resort.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to do "complete justice" under Article 142 forms the basis for its jurisdiction to entertain curative petitions. It's an inherent power to address situations where serious errors of justice might have occurred.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While newly discovered evidence might be a ground for an appeal or review, it is not typically a ground for a curative petition. Curative petitions generally focus on errors in the judicial process itself, such as procedural irregularities or a violation of principles of natural justice.

Statement 4 is correct.  Allegations of judicial bias, where a judge failed to disclose a conflict of interest or where there's a clear apprehension of bias impacting the judgment, can be grounds for a curative petition.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

Statement 2 is partially correct. FTSCs handle cases under the POCSO Act, but they also handle rape cases and other similar offenses.  It's not solely limited to POCSO cases.

Statement 3 is correct. FTSCs are established as a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government provides significant funding and support for their operation.

Statement 4 is correct. The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases related to sexual offenses, including rape and those under the POCSO Act. Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**4. Consider the following features of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1.  The RTI Act mandates the disclosure of all information held by public authorities, without exception.
2.  The Act establishes a three-tier appellate mechanism for citizens to appeal against decisions of Public Information Officers (PIOs).
3.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is empowered to impose penalties on PIOs for delays or refusal to provide information.
4.  Certain intelligence and security organizations are exempt from the provisions of the RTI Act.


How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RTI Act does have exemptions, as specified in Section 8, protecting certain information related to national security, personal information, and other sensitive matters.  Not all information is subject to mandatory disclosure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While there is an appellate mechanism, it’s not a three-tier system.  It generally involves an appeal to the first appellate authority (often a senior officer within the public authority), and then a further appeal to the Central Information Commission (CIC) or State Information Commission (SIC).

Statement 3 is correct. The CIC/SIC has the power to impose penalties on PIOs who fail to provide information timely, correctly, or completely.  This is a key enforcement mechanism of the RTI Act.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Second Schedule of the RTI Act lists certain intelligence and security organizations that are exempt from the disclosure requirements.  This is to protect national security and sensitive operational information. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning Contempt of Court in India:**

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Civil contempt is the willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt includes actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court or obstruct the administration of justice.  These are distinct categories.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 (Supreme Court) and 215 (High Courts) provide the constitutional basis for the inherent power of courts to punish for contempt.  This is essential to maintaining the dignity and authority of the judicial system.

Statement 3 is correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, lays down the procedures and processes involved in handling contempt of court cases, ensuring due process is followed.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can hear appeals on contempt cases from lower courts, the High Courts also have the inherent power to punish for contempt within their respective jurisdictions.  Lower courts can initiate contempt proceedings against individuals within their own jurisdictions. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters.

Statement 2 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters, aiming to resolve petty disputes at the village level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They are guided by principles of natural justice, allowing for more flexibility in evidence admissibility to facilitate speedy resolution of disputes.

Statement 4 is correct. The appellate structure involves appeals to the District Court for civil cases and the Court of Session for criminal cases.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used historically, it's no longer the basis for funding SCS.  Funding mechanisms have evolved.

Statement 3 is correct.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the concept of SCS was effectively discontinued, and no new states have been granted this status.

Statement 4 is incorrect.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool, while horizontal devolution refers to the distribution among states from their allocated share.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states by the Centre as per Article 275 of the Indian Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the approval of the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 270 of the Indian Constitution mandates that the Finance Commission recommends the principles governing the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  This is a cornerstone of India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is correct. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes allocated to the states from the center,  while horizontal devolution deals with the distribution of that share among different states based on various criteria decided by the Finance Commission. The 15th Finance Commission, for instance, used criteria such as income distance, area, population, and demographic performance.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 empowers the Union to grant financial assistance to states that need it. These grants are often used to address specific needs or developmental goals.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Union Government can borrow both within and outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only within India (Article 293).  Furthermore, a state indebted to the Union requires the Union's consent for further borrowing.  The statement misrepresents the restrictions placed on state borrowing.

(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The SCS was initially introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission to assist states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.

Statement 2 is correct.  Historically, states with SCS received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, although this has evolved over time.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Constitution does not contain any provision for officially designating states as SCS.  The SCS was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 4 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the abolition of the SCS, leading to its discontinuation.  The current funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on different recommendations.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
2.  ADCs consist of 30 members, all elected by the people of the region.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 244(2) of the Indian Constitution, which incorporates the Sixth Schedule, grants the Governor the power to create ADCs and ARCs in specified states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ADCs have a maximum of 30 members,  a portion of these members are nominated by the Governor, not all are elected.

Statement 3 is correct. ARCs are designed to cater to the specific needs and representation of particular tribes within the larger autonomous districts.

Statement 4 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs possess executive, legislative, and judicial powers within their specified domains, not just legislative powers.  They have significant autonomy in matters like land revenue, taxation, and local governance.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India:**

1. The current framework of CSSs is based on the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.
2. CSSs primarily focus on schemes related to the National Development Agenda for achieving Vision 2022.
3.  Funding for all CSSs is directly transferred to the states by the Union Government, bypassing the Consolidated Fund of the State.
4. Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, CSSs have become the primary mode of specific-purpose transfers from the Union to the States.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current structure and guidelines for CSSs are largely based on the recommendations of the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

Statement 2 is correct. CSSs are designed to address key aspects of the National Development Agenda and contribute to national goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although the Union Government provides the funding, all transfers for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State. This ensures transparency and accountability within the state's financial system.

Statement 4 is correct.  The abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, as recommended by the 14th Finance Commission, significantly increased the importance of CSSs as a mechanism for transferring funds from the Union to the states for specific purposes.

(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mission Karmayogi's core objective is to develop a highly skilled and adaptable civil service equipped to address India's evolving developmental challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi explicitly covers all civil servants, including contractual employees, aiming for comprehensive capacity building across the entire civil service.

Statement 3 is correct. A significant shift in Mission Karmayogi's approach is the move from a rule-based to a role-based training and capacity-building framework, focusing on the practical application of skills.

Statement 4 is correct. The CBC was launched in 2021 as a crucial component of the NPCSCB, playing a central role in implementing Mission Karmayogi's initiatives.

While the majority of cantonments were established before independence, six were established after India gained independence.

3. The judgment significantly limits the scope of fundamental rights in environmental matters.
4. The judgment was delivered in response to a public interest litigation.
5.  The judgment explicitly mentions the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental right.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's ruling?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The Supreme Court did indeed link the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution, and the case did concern the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the judgment actually expanded, not limited, the scope of fundamental rights in relation to environmental concerns. While the judgment arose from a petition, the exact nature (public interest litigation or otherwise) is not explicitly stated in the provided text. Statement 5 is also incorrect, as the text doesn't state the judgement explicitly mentioned a right to a healthy environment as a fundamental right; it linked it to existing articles.

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The President appoints the Chairperson and members based on recommendations, the NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court, including summoning witnesses, and removal is not by impeachment but by Presidential order after consultation with the Supreme Court. Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional one, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the tenure is three years or until age 70, not five years.

Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, including death sentences and court-martial cases. The President can indeed commute a death sentence to life imprisonment. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while there's some debate, the President's decision is generally not directly subject to judicial review.

(b) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.

The RTI Act did indeed come into effect in October 2005, it grants citizens access to information held by public authorities, the Department of Personnel and Training coordinates its implementation, and it replaced the earlier Freedom of Information Act.  Statement 5 is partially correct in that the Supreme Court played a significant role in shaping the understanding of the right to information, but it didn't explicitly declare it a fundamental right under Article 19 in the same way that some other rights are defined.  The Supreme Court's rulings significantly influenced the enactment of the RTI Act, but the act itself doesn't directly cite Article 19.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. SCS was indeed introduced based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations and the 14th Finance Commission did recommend its discontinuation.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for a time, it's not the only method and not currently in use. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Constitution doesn't explicitly define SCS; it's a policy decision. Statement 5 is incorrect because the criteria for granting SCS are not purely objective and are based on a combination of factors, including geographical and socio-economic considerations.  The decision is a political one, not solely based on objective constitutional criteria.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The Sixth Schedule is indeed a product of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, it governs tribal areas, provides significant autonomy to tribal councils, and was introduced to address their specific needs.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The Constitution does permit preventive detention under specific circumstances, Article 22(5) guarantees the right to make a representation, and the National Security Act is an example of a preventive detention law.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the right to consult a lawyer exists generally, it's not guaranteed during the initial period of preventive detention under Article 22(3).  Statement 5 is incorrect; those detained under preventive detention have fewer protections than those arrested under ordinary criminal law.  The protections afforded under Article 22 are limited in cases of preventive detention.

6.  NITI Aayog

State Finance Commissions are established by state governments under Article 280, but their functions are not explicitly detailed in the Constitution.  The Central Vigilance Commission and the Law Commission are statutory bodies created by Parliament. NITI Aayog is a policy think tank established by a government resolution, making it non-constitutional.  Therefore, only two of the listed bodies, UPSC and NCSC, are constitutionally mandated.

(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonments originated with the British East India Company's military needs after the Battle of Plassey.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Ministry of Defence holds administrative control over Cantonment Boards. Statement 3 is incorrect. While cantonments house military personnel, they also include civilian populations. Statement 4 is correct. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing cantonment administration, aligning with the principles of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act related to local self-government.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one false statement.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the judgment linked the right to a healthy environment to Articles 14 and 21, not Article 32.  Statement 2 is correct; the case involved the Great Indian Bustard. Statement 3 is correct; the judgment expanded the scope of fundamental rights to include environmental concerns. Statement 4 is incorrect; the judgment did not create a new constitutional body.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following features related to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system and Proportional Representation (PR):**

1. FPTP systems tend to result in more stable governments than PR systems.
2. PR systems ensure a more accurate reflection of the popular vote share in the legislature.
3. FPTP systems are simpler for voters to understand than PR systems.

Which of the above statements accurately contrast FPTP and PR systems?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly highlight key differences. FPTP often leads to single-party majority governments (more stable), while PR reflects vote share more accurately but frequently results in coalition governments (potentially less stable). FPTP is simpler for voters. Statement 5 is incorrect; PR systems often use larger constituencies or even nationwide voting.

(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct.  Statement 2 is incorrect; vertical devolution is the share from the divisible pool *to* states, not *among* them. Horizontal devolution is the distribution among states. Statement 4 is incorrect; state governments can borrow only within India, not abroad.


**5. Consider the following about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria for granting SCS to states.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only

(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements accurately describe the Doctrine of Coverture?

(a) 1, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect; it treated the married woman as one entity with her husband. Statement 3 is incorrect; while significantly weakened, it hasn't been entirely overturned in all aspects of Indian law.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Cantonments Act, 2006
2. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act
3. The Ministry of Defence
4.  Executive orders establishing military stations

Which of the above are directly involved in the administration of cantonments in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with local self-government, and while cantonments have their own boards, the overarching legal framework is influenced by this amendment. The Ministry of Defence has administrative control over cantonments. Executive orders establish military stations, which are distinct from cantonments that house both military and civilian populations.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are directly involved in cantonment administration. Option 4, while relevant to military areas, is not directly involved in the administration of a cantonment as a whole.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change and fundamental rights:**

1. The judgment was based on a writ petition concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard.
2.  The judgment invoked Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
3. The judgment limited the scope of fundamental rights to environmental matters.
4. The petition challenged the government's inaction on climate change mitigation policies.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Supreme Court's decision?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Supreme Court case did indeed concern the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, and the judgment explicitly referenced Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) to expand their application to encompass the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change. Statement 3 is incorrect; the judgment *expanded* the scope of fundamental rights, not limited it. While the petition might have indirectly touched upon climate change mitigation, the core issue was the protection of the bustard and its habitat, making statement 4 an inaccurate representation of the case's central focus.


**3. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2. Parts of Himachal Pradesh are designated as Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.

4. A foreigner requires a special permit to visit a Protected Area, but not a Restricted Area.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Arunachal Pradesh is wholly designated as a Protected Area. Statement 2 is also correct; parts of Himachal Pradesh fall under Restricted Areas. Statement 3 is incorrect; Sikkim is partly Protected and partly Restricted.  Statement 4 is incorrect; special permits are needed for both Protected and Restricted Areas, except for citizens of Bhutan.


**4. Consider the following aspects of India’s Fiscal Federalism:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations determine the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds between the Union and States.
3.  Horizontal devolution is based solely on population figures.
4. Grants-in-aid are provided to states as per Article 275 of the Constitution.

How many of these statements correctly describe key elements of India's Fiscal Federalism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in resource allocation. Vertical devolution describes the central-state revenue sharing.  Article 275 provides the constitutional basis for grants-in-aid. Statement 3 is incorrect; horizontal devolution considers multiple criteria, not just population, as exemplified by the 15th Finance Commission's methodology.


**5. Consider the following about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants for SCS states.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.
4.  Special packages are provided to states based solely on the need for additional funding.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the Special Category Status?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None of the above


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used for determining grants to SCS states. Statement 1 is incorrect because the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS.  Statement 3 is false; the 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS system. Statement 4 is incorrect; special packages are discretionary and not solely based on financial need, but also on socio-economic factors.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It empowers the President to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
3.  ADCs have the power to make laws on subjects like land revenue collection and taxation.
4.  The PESA Act, 1996 applies to areas covered by the Sixth Schedule.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Sixth Schedule stems from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, and ADCs under this schedule do have legislative and executive powers, including taxation and land revenue. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Governor, not the President, creates ADCs. Statement 4 is incorrect; the PESA Act applies to Fifth Schedule areas, not the Sixth.


**7. Consider the following related to the formation of new states in India:**

1.  Article 3 of the Constitution deals with the formation of new states.
2.  The President's recommendation is required for introducing a bill on state formation.
3.  The state legislatures have the primary power to decide on the formation of new states.

(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Article 3 outlines the process, and the President's recommendation is mandatory for introducing a bill. Statement 3 is incorrect; Parliament, not state legislatures, holds the power to form new states. Statement 4 is also incorrect; special majority is required for passing a bill on state formation.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1.  It is a constitutional body.
2.  It is governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.
3.  The selection of the CBI Director involves the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.
4.  The CBI's jurisdiction extends to all states without requiring their consent.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CBI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The CBI is governed by the DSPE Act, and its director's selection involves the mentioned panel. Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-constitutional body. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CBI needs the consent of states for investigations within their jurisdiction.


**9. Consider the following concerning the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1.  The DPBI's decisions are appealable to the Supreme Court of India.
2.  Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI in case of a data breach.

(b) 2 and 3 only

(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Data fiduciaries must inform the DPBI of breaches, and data principals have the right to data correction and erasure. Statement 1 is incorrect; appeals go to the TDSAT, not the Supreme Court. Statement 4 is incorrect; the DPBI imposes penalties, but it doesn't directly prosecute.


**10. Consider the following related to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) solely determines the MCC.
2.  The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during Lok Sabha elections.
3.  The MCC applies only to political parties and not individual candidates.
4.  The MCC aims to ensure free and fair elections.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Model Code of Conduct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The MCC's purpose is to ensure free and fair elections.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the ECI formulates the MCC in consultation with political parties. Statement 2 is incorrect; it was first introduced in Kerala state assembly elections.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the MCC applies to both parties and candidates.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult' by incorporating closely related distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to all states in India.
2.  They function as mobile courts, settling both civil and criminal disputes at the village level.
3. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases are heard by the High Court, and in criminal cases by the Supreme Court.
4. They are bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, exempts certain states and tribal areas. Statement 3 is partially incorrect; appeals in civil cases go to the district court, not the High Court. Statement 4 is incorrect because Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but by principles of natural justice. The inclusion of seemingly correct but subtly inaccurate statements (like the incorrect appellate courts) makes this question challenging.


**2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:**

1.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines both civil and criminal contempt.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves acts that scandalize the court.
3. The Supreme Court's power to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 128 and 216 of the Constitution.
4.  Only the Supreme Court can hear appeals against contempt of court judgments.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct descriptions of civil and criminal contempt. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the relevant articles are 129 and 215, not 128 and 216.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; High Courts also have the power to hear contempt cases related to their jurisdictions. The use of similar-sounding article numbers as distractors increases the question's difficulty.


**3. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 73 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, and commute death sentences.
2. The President's power extends to all offenses, regardless of the court that imposed the sentence.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and cannot be challenged in court.
4. Mercy petitions are only applicable to cases involving capital punishment.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 partially correct,  as the correct article is Article 72, not 73.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the President's power is limited to specific offenses (those under the Union's executive power, court-martial sentences, and death sentences). Statement 3 is incorrect; while the President's decision carries significant weight, there have been instances of judicial review in related matters. Statement 4 is incorrect; mercy petitions can be filed for other sentences besides death. The question's difficulty arises from the subtle inaccuracies and the close relationship between the correct and incorrect statements.


**4. Consider the following statements about Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court:**

1.  They are a remedy available after a review petition under Article 136 is dismissed.
2.  They were established in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.
3.  The power for curative petitions stems from Article 141 (power of judicial review).
4.  A curative petition can be filed if there's a violation of principles of natural justice or an apprehension of bias.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the correct article is Article 137, not 136. Statement 3 is incorrect; the power stems from Article 142 (power to do complete justice), not 141.  The proximity of the article numbers and the similar nature of the articles make this a challenging question.


**5. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They were launched in 2018 as a state-sponsored scheme.
2.  Their funding comes primarily from the Chief Minister's Relief Fund.
3.  They primarily handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
4.  Their implementation is overseen by the Ministry of Home Affairs.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; they were launched in 2019 as a *centrally* sponsored scheme. Statement 2 is incorrect; their funding comes from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 4 is incorrect; their implementation is overseen by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.  The incorrect details regarding funding source and implementing ministry create significant confusion.


**6. Consider the following regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

3. The local self-government of cantonments is a subject matter of the State List.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 4 and 1 are partially correct. The correct battle is Plassey, not Panipat, and the act is based on the 74th, not the 73rd, Constitutional Amendment Act. Statement 3 is incorrect; local self-government of cantonments falls under the Union List. The deliberate misinformation regarding the battle and constitutional amendment makes this question difficult.



**7. Consider the following regarding the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues:**

1. The Supreme Court's recent judgment on climate change invoked Articles 15 and 22.
2. The *M.K. Ranjitsinh v. Union of India* case concerned the protection of the Asiatic Lion and its habitat.
3. The judgment expanded the scope of fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 and 21.
4. This is an example of the Supreme Court using its power of judicial review to broaden the scope of fundamental rights.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the articles invoked were 14 and 21, not 15 and 22. Statement 2 is incorrect; the case concerned the Great Indian Bustard, not the Asiatic Lion.  The subtle changes in the articles and the animal species create a challenging question.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It was launched in 2019 to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans.
2.  It involves all three tiers of Panchayats and various stakeholders like SHGs.

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it was launched in 2018, not 2019.  The slight inaccuracy in the launch year, combined with the other correct statements, makes this a demanding question.


**9. Consider the following regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. It was inaugurated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
2. It aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3. It is the first such centre in South Asia.
4.  It is primarily funded by the World Bank.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; it was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat. Statement 3 is incorrect; it is the first such centre in *India*, not South Asia.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the source of funding is not specified in the provided text. The incorrect location and the unclear funding source make this a difficult question.


**10. Consider the following about the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India:**

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and applies only to commercial disputes.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards obtained through fraud or corruption, effective from October 23, 2021.
3. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, facilitates institutional arbitration.
4. The Indian Council of Arbitration is a statutory body established by an Act of Parliament.

How many of the statements are correct?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are partially correct. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, applies to all kinds of arbitrations, not only commercial disputes, and the 2021 amendment was effective retrospectively from October 23, 2015, not 2021.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Indian Council of Arbitration is a society registered under the Societies Registration Act, 1860, not a statutory body. The combination of partially correct and incorrect statements creates a challenging question.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" in 2018 by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  The campaign involves only elected representatives at the Panchayat level.
4. The PDI (Panchayat Development Index) is used to assess the financial health of Panchayats.
5.  The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The primary aim of Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to enhance public participation in the PDP preparation process.  Statement 2 is partially correct; while the Abhiyan was launched as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," it was initiated by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Abhiyan's implementation involves not only elected representatives but also frontline workers, CBOs (including SHGs), and other stakeholders across all three Panchayat tiers. Statement 4 is incorrect; the PDI assesses the overall holistic development, performance, and progress of Panchayats, not just their financial health. Statement 5 is correct:  The approved GPDPs are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.  Therefore, only three statements (1, 2 – with correction, and 5) are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions (MoPPG&P) issues guidelines for handling public grievances.

3.  Grievance redressal timelines have been increased to 30 days from the previous 21 days.
4. The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) ranks Ministries/Departments monthly.
5.  CPGRAMS is a 24/7 online platform for lodging grievances with state authorities only.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the GRM?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The MoPPG&P plays a crucial role in setting guidelines for grievance redressal. Statement 2 is also correct: Nodal officers are appointed to ensure prompt and efficient handling of grievances. Statement 3 is incorrect: The timelines for grievance redressal have been *reduced* to 21 days, not increased. Statement 4 is correct: The GRAI is used for monthly ranking of Ministries/Departments based on their grievance redressal performance. Statement 5 is incorrect; CPGRAMS connects to both central and state ministries/departments.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. CSSs are schemes jointly funded by the central and state governments.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by the Planning Commission.
3. CSSs primarily focus on schemes within the State List of the Constitution.
4.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations significantly altered the funding pattern of CSSs.
5.  NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features of CSSs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: CSSs involve joint funding from the Centre and States. Statement 2 is partially correct; the current framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, not the Planning Commission. Statement 3 is incorrect; CSSs cover schemes from both the State and Concurrent Lists. Statement 4 is correct: The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to significant changes in the funding and implementation of CSSs. Statement 5 is incorrect; NITI Aayog plays a significant role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations. Therefore, only three statements (1, 4, with correction to statement 2) are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about Mission Karmayogi:**

1. It aims to create a future-ready civil service based on a competency-driven approach.
2.  The 70-20-10 mandate emphasizes classroom training as the primary learning method.
3.  The iGOT-Karmayogi platform is used for monitoring the performance of all users.
4. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on the training of senior bureaucrats.
5. It promotes a shift from rule-based to role-based training.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the key features of Mission Karmayogi?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a competency-driven approach to civil service capacity building. Statement 2 is incorrect: The 70-20-10 mandate prioritizes on-the-job experience and peer learning over traditional classroom training. Statement 3 is correct: The iGOT-Karmayogi platform monitors the performance of learners, supervisors, and content providers. Statement 4 is incorrect: Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, not just senior bureaucrats. Statement 5 is correct: It advocates a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.  Therefore, four statements (1, 3, 5, with correction to statement 2) accurately reflect Mission Karmayogi's features.

5.  ELFA/DLFA operate independently of the CAG's supervision.


How many of the statements above correctly describe aspects of local body auditing in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat. Statement 2 is correct: The 73rd and 74th Amendments provide the constitutional framework for local self-governance. Statement 3 is correct: The CAG's authority over local body audits is derived from the 1971 Act. Statement 4 is correct: AuditOnline is used for online auditing of Panchayat accounts. Statement 5 is incorrect: ELFA/DLFA operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG.  Therefore, four statements (2, 3, 4, with correction to statement 1 and 5) are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1. SCS is constitutionally mandated for states facing socio-economic disadvantages.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants for SCS states.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.
4.  States with SCS receive special provisions under Articles 371 to 371-J.
5.  Bihar currently holds Special Category Status.


How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of Special Category Status in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SCS is not constitutionally mandated but a classification based on various factors. Statement 2 is correct: The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was previously used for allocating grants to SCS states. Statement 3 is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission effectively ended the SCS classification. Statement 4 is partially correct;  while special provisions exist under Articles 371-371J, they are not solely for SCS states. Statement 5 is incorrect; Bihar does not currently hold Special Category Status. Therefore, only two statements (2, with correction to statement 4) are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Rural Development in 2019.
3.  A key component involves holding structured Ward Sabhas, Gram Sabhas, and Block Sabhas.
4. The initiative exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People's Plan Campaign (PPC), explicitly aims to enhance public participation in the creation of PDPs.  This participatory approach is crucial for ensuring that development plans reflect the needs and priorities of the local communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the aim is similar, the campaign was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2018, not the Ministry of Rural Development in 2019.  This subtle difference in ministry and year highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Structured meetings at various levels (Ward, Gram, and Block Sabhas) are integral to the Abhiyan's process. These meetings facilitate discussions, consultations, and the incorporation of community feedback into the PDPs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Abhiyan's scope extends beyond just GPDPs. It encompasses the preparation of Block Panchayat Development Plans and District Panchayat Development Plans as well, demonstrating a multi-tiered approach to rural development planning.


**2. Consider the following features of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  It is the second centre of its kind in India, focusing on auditing local governance bodies.
2.  It serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors.
3.  Its primary function is to enhance the dependence of local government auditors.
4. It was inaugurated in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.

How many of the above statements accurately describe iCAL?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is the *first* such centre in India, a significant detail that distinguishes it and underscores its pioneering role in establishing auditing standards for local governance.

Statement 2 is correct. iCAL functions as a collaborative hub, bringing together policymakers and auditors to share knowledge and best practices. This collaborative approach is vital for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of local government audits.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The aim is to enhance the *independence* of local government auditors, not their dependence. Independent audits are crucial for ensuring accountability and transparency in local governance.  The use of the word "dependence" is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's careful reading and understanding.

Statement 4 is incorrect. iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad.  This seemingly minor geographical detail tests the candidate's precise recall of factual information.



**3. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018:**

1. Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
2. The Act violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
3. Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.
4. The State can freely enter into contracts with private corporations for sharing Aadhaar data.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment specifically addressed these points, highlighting the court's careful balancing of individual rights and the government's need for effective governance.

Statement 1 contradicts the judgment, which explicitly limits Aadhaar metadata storage to a maximum of six months.  This showcases the importance of knowing the specific details of the court's ruling.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the court affirmed that the Act does *not* violate the mentioned fundamental rights. The court meticulously examined the Act's provisions to ensure that it didn't infringe on citizens' rights.

Statement 3 is false. The judgment clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes, it cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  This distinction is crucial.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The court explicitly prohibited the State from entering into contracts with private corporations for sharing Aadhaar data, emphasizing the importance of protecting citizens' privacy.


**4. Consider the following aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. CSSs are entirely funded by the central government.
2. CSSs are implemented solely through central government agencies.
3. The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers.
4. CSSs exclusively cover subjects in the Union List of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics of CSSs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers on the rationalization of CSSs.  This highlights the iterative nature of policymaking and the involvement of state governments in shaping central schemes.

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs involve *shared* funding between the Centre and States, not complete central funding.  The sharing ratio can vary depending on the specific scheme.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are implemented *through* States, even though they are jointly funded, reflecting the federal structure of the Indian government.

Statement 4 is incorrect. CSSs cover subjects from both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, showcasing the collaborative nature of Centre-State relations in policy implementation.


**5.  Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions (Article 72):**

1. The President can only grant pardons for offences against laws relating to matters under the State List.
2. The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3. The President's decision on mercy petitions is not subject to judicial review.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the President's powers under Article 72?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The President's power under Article 72 explicitly includes the authority to commute death sentences, a significant power in the criminal justice system.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's power extends to offences against laws relating to matters under the Union List as well as offences where the executive power of the Union extends.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not immune to judicial review. Courts have the power to examine the process and legality of the decision, although the scope of review is limited.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The President's power extends to sentences awarded by court-martials as well as sentences for offences against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.


**6. Consider the following about Curative Petitions:**

1. A curative petition is the first recourse available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to hear curative petitions stems from Article 136.
3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there is a violation of principles of natural justice or if the judge failed to disclose a connection with the subject matter.
4. The concept of curative petitions was established in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.


How many of the above statements correctly describe curative petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition is dismissed, and it is filed to address violations of natural justice, non-disclosure of connections by judges, or apprehensions of bias.  The *Rupa Ashok Hurra* case is foundational in establishing the curative petition mechanism.

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last*, not the first, recourse. This is a critical distinction that tests understanding of the hierarchical structure of legal remedies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions is derived from Article 142, which empowers it to do complete justice. Article 136 deals with the Court's appellate jurisdiction.


**7. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are a state-sponsored scheme primarily funded by state budgets.
2.  FTSCs are primarily focused on handling cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

4.  The Nirbhaya Fund contributes to the funding of FTSCs.

How many of the above statements are accurate concerning FTSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. FTSCs are indeed primarily designed to expedite cases under the POCSO Act and other related offences, and they do receive funding from the Nirbhaya Fund.

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, with funding shared between the Centre and States.  This distinction is crucial in understanding the funding mechanisms of government schemes.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  FTSCs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  This highlights the importance of knowing the precise implementing ministry.


**8. Consider the following regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, mandates their establishment in all villages across India.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be courts of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed deemed to be courts of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, granting them the necessary legal standing to handle cases.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, does not mandate their establishment in *all* villages.  There are exceptions, particularly in certain states and tribal areas.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* strictly bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate under the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas are to be disposed of within 6 months, not 3 months, from the date of filing.  This difference in timeframe shows the importance of precise factual knowledge.


**9. Consider the following concerning the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1. The MCC was first introduced in the 1970s.
2. The MCC is a legally binding document enforced by the courts.
3. The Election Commission of India (ECI) formulates the MCC in consultation with political parties.
4. The MCC applies only to Lok Sabha elections.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the MCC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The ECI does indeed formulate the MCC in consultation with political parties to ensure consensus and broad acceptance.  This consultative process is key to the MCC's effectiveness.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960, not the 1970s, a notable difference that highlights the need for precise knowledge of historical context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC is not legally binding in the same way as a statute.  While it carries significant moral and political weight, violations are primarily addressed through ECI directives and public pressure, not court enforcement.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The MCC applies to all elections, both national and state-level.  Its scope is not limited to Lok Sabha elections.


**10. Consider the following features of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) is responsible for implementing the FCRA.
2.  NGOs are required to submit their annual returns bi-annually.
3.  The FCRA mandates a designated FCRA account in any branch of a nationalized bank.
4.  The maximum permissible amount for administrative expenses from foreign contributions is now 50%.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the FCRA (post-2020 amendments)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The MHA is indeed responsible for implementing the FCRA. This reflects the sensitive nature of foreign funding and the government's role in regulating it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NGOs are required to submit their annual returns *annually*, not bi-annually.  This small difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FCRA mandates a designated FCRA account in specific branches of the State Bank of India, New Delhi, not just any nationalized bank.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The maximum permissible amount for administrative expenses from foreign contributions is 20%, not 50%, after the 2020 amendments. This change reflects a stricter regulation of the use of foreign funds.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas".

4. The Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP) prepared under this Abhiyan is published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  The Abhiyan's core objective is to boost public involvement in creating Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs). It was initially launched in 2018 under the banner of "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Finally, the approved GPDPs are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal for transparency and accessibility.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Abhiyan's implementation involves not only elected representatives but also frontline government workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders at all three tiers of Panchayats. This multi-stakeholder approach is crucial for inclusive planning and execution.


**2. Consider the following features of the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSS funding is solely managed by the central government.
2.  They primarily focus on schemes aligned with the National Development Agenda and Vision 2022.
3. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of CSSs.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding CSSs?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects that CSSs concentrate on schemes integral to the National Development Agenda and the vision for 2022, requiring collaboration between the Centre and States.  Statement 4 is also correct; all financial transfers for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.  Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the Centre.  Furthermore, the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, while leading to changes in the funding structure, did not result in the abolishment of CSSs; instead, they became the main method of specific-purpose transfers from the Union to the States.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  SCS grants were historically based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  Historically, SCS grants were indeed distributed using the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  And following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS designation has been discontinued, with no state currently holding this status.  Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention the categorization of states as SCS states; the classification was a policy decision.  Special packages are discretionary and not based on a rigid, pre-defined formula; they aim to address the specific needs of states facing socio-economic or geographical challenges.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was established based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It primarily concerns the administration of tribal areas in Assam and Meghalaya.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 correctly reflect key aspects of the Sixth Schedule.  It primarily deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states, notably Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Crucially, it mandates the creation of autonomous district councils to manage these areas' affairs. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Sixth Schedule's provisions don't apply uniformly across all states with tribal populations; its application is specific to the states mentioned above.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole agency handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  CPGRAMS is a platform exclusively for lodging grievances related to corruption.
3.  The Sevottam model incorporates GRM as one of its modules.
4.  State-level GRMs operate independently of the Union Government's mechanisms.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of GRM?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Sevottam model, designed to enhance public service delivery, indeed includes the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) as a key component.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while DARPG plays a significant role, the Directorate of Public Grievances under the Cabinet Secretariat also handles grievances at the Union level. Statement 2 is incorrect; CPGRAMS is a broader platform for various service delivery-related grievances, not limited to corruption alone.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while states have their own mechanisms, they often interact and are connected with the Union Government's systems for efficient grievance redressal.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Auditing of Local Bodies:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) does not audit the accounts of local bodies.
2. The AuditOnline application facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.

How many of the statements above are correct concerning the auditing of local bodies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The AuditOnline application was indeed developed to streamline the online auditing of panchayat accounts, enhancing accountability.  The iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of local government audits.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the CAG does audit local bodies, exercising control and supervision over their accounts.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; ELFAs operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG.


**7. Consider the following about the  National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) - Mission Karmayogi:**

1. It focuses solely on training newly recruited civil servants.
2. It promotes a rule-based approach to capacity building.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Mission Karmayogi's scope encompasses all civil servants, including those on contractual employment, across various Union Government ministries and agencies.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it's not limited to newly recruited civil servants but aims for continuous capacity building throughout their careers. Statement 2 is incorrect; it emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training and competency-driven development.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the CBC, a crucial part of the NPCSCB, was launched *in conjunction with* Mission Karmayogi, not after.


**8. Consider the following elements related to Aadhaar:**

1. Aadhaar serves as proof of both citizenship and domicile.
2. Aadhaar data is stored decentrally for enhanced security.
3.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for all government services.
4. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.

How many of the above statements are correct about Aadhaar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is partially correct, with a significant caveat. While the Aadhaar Act does make Aadhaar mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it does *not* mandate it for all government services, and it cannot be forced for bank accounts or mobile connections.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar is proof of address and identity for residents of India but not proof of citizenship or domicile. Statement 2 is incorrect; Aadhaar data is stored centrally, not decentrally.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in its 2018 judgment, subject to certain conditions and safeguards.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched in 2024 as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’.
3.  It involves all three tiers of Panchayats, including elected representatives and community-based organizations.
4. The campaign includes structured Ward Sabhas and the use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The core aim of Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is to boost the involvement of citizens in the process of creating Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  This participatory approach is crucial for ensuring that the plans genuinely reflect the needs and priorities of the local communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, initially launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’, was rolled out in 2018, not 2024. The 2025-26 PDP preparation is a recent iteration of the ongoing campaign.  This subtle difference in dates is a key distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The Abhiyan actively engages all three tiers of Panchayats, which includes local elected representatives.  The inclusion of community-based organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs) is also a vital component, ensuring that diverse voices are heard and considered in the planning process.  This multi-tiered approach signifies a comprehensive strategy for grassroots development.

Statement 4 is correct. The campaign employs structured Ward Sabhas/Mahila Sabhas/Gram Sabhas to facilitate the development plan formulation.  The use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) for identifying thematic developmental gaps adds a data-driven dimension to the planning process, enabling a more targeted and effective approach to address local challenges.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 3, and 4) are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. It is a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors.
2. It aims to set global standards for auditing local bodies in India only.
3. It enhances the independence of local government auditors.
4.  It utilizes the AuditOnline application for online auditing of panchayat accounts.

Which of the above statements accurately describe iCAL?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. iCAL serves as a collaborative platform, bringing together policymakers and auditors to share best practices and improve the auditing of local governance. This collaborative aspect is central to its goal of enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of local governance audits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While iCAL is indeed the first of its kind in India, its stated aim is to set *global* standards for auditing local governance bodies, not just within India.  The global reach of its aspirations is a crucial detail to distinguish it from a purely domestic initiative.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key objective of iCAL is to strengthen the independence of local government auditors. Independent audits are critical for ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of public funds and the delivery of public services.  This independence is a cornerstone of good governance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the AuditOnline application is a significant initiative in the area of local body auditing, it is a separate program developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not a direct component of iCAL.  The linkage is plausible but incorrect.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately describe iCAL.


**3. Consider the following aspects of the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) system in India:**

1.  The Online Mediation Training Web-Portal was launched by the Ministry of Law and Justice.
2.  The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was established in 2010.
3.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law.
4.  The 2021 amendment to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act allows for a conditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards in cases of fraud.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Online Mediation Training Web-Portal was launched by the Supreme Court of India, not the Ministry of Law and Justice. This is a crucial detail that differentiates the judicial and executive branches.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCPC was constituted by the Supreme Court of India in 2005, not 2010. This minor difference in the year is a potential distractor, testing precise factual knowledge.

Statement 3 is correct. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is indeed based on the UNCITRAL (United Nations Commission on International Trade Law) Model Law, reflecting India’s integration with international standards in dispute resolution.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The 2021 amendment allows for an *unconditional*, not conditional, stay of enforcement of arbitral awards in cases where the arbitration agreement, contracts, or award itself were obtained through fraud or corruption. The word "unconditional" is key here.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Mission Karmayogi:**

1.  It aims to create a future-looking civil service with a shared understanding of India’s development priorities.
2.  It includes only permanent civil servants of the Union Government.
3.  It emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training.
4. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was launched as part of Mission Karmayogi in 2020.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mission Karmayogi's overarching goal is to cultivate a highly skilled, forward-thinking civil service that is deeply aligned with India's developmental ambitions and national priorities.  This forward-looking approach is a key characteristic of the mission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope extends to *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various Union Government ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies. This inclusive approach is a vital aspect of the mission’s design.

Statement 3 is correct.  A fundamental shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building is a core tenet of Mission Karmayogi. This shift emphasizes competency-based development, aligning training with the actual roles and responsibilities of civil servants.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The CBC was launched in 2021, not 2020, as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi.  The one-year difference is a designed distractor.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 3, and 4) are accurate.


**5. Consider the following features of the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. It repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
2. Spectrum allocation is exclusively through auction.
3.  It establishes a new regulatory framework for Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.
4.  It expands the scope of the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) to include research and development.

Which of the above statements are correctly reflected in the Act?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, modernizes the legal framework by repealing the outdated Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.  This repeal reflects the significant technological advancements in the telecommunications sector.

Statement 2 is correct, but with a nuance. While the Act prioritizes auctioning for spectrum allocation, it also allows for administrative allocation in specific cases, such as national security and disaster management. The exclusive nature of the statement is the distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act does *not* regulate OTT platforms.  This omission is deliberate, leaving the regulation of OTT platforms to be addressed through other means. This is a critical difference.

Statement 4 is correct. The Act expands the scope of the USOF (now Digital Bharat Nidhi) to encompass research and development in telecommunication services, technologies, and products. This expansion reflects a proactive approach to technological innovation.

Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States and implemented by the States.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report.
3.  All transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.
4. The funding pattern for core schemes is uniformly 60:40 (Centre:State).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are indeed jointly funded by the central and state governments, with implementation primarily undertaken by the states.  This shared responsibility is a defining feature of CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015). This report serves as the foundation for the current structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  All transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.  This is a crucial distinction in financial management.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While a 60:40 (Centre:State) funding pattern is common, it is not uniform. Different funding ratios apply to certain states, particularly in the Northeast and Himalayan regions, where a 90:10 ratio might be seen.  This variation is a key aspect of the CSS funding model.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Parts of Sikkim are designated as Restricted Areas.
3.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected Areas, irrespective of their nationality.
4. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs access to both Protected and Restricted Areas.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Arunachal Pradesh is wholly designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963. This reflects the sensitive geographical and strategic importance of the state.

Statement 2 is correct. Parts of Sikkim are indeed designated as Restricted Areas, while other parts are considered Protected Areas.  This distinction reflects the varying levels of access restrictions based on geographical and strategic considerations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While foreigners generally need special permits for Protected and Restricted Areas, citizens of Bhutan are exempted.  This exception is a critical detail that makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 4 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, is the primary legal instrument that governs access to both Protected and Restricted Areas in India.  It outlines the procedures and requirements for obtaining special permits.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are correct.


**8. Consider the following aspects of the Aadhaar system in India:**

1. Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile.
2. Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
3.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services.
4.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, with certain conditions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  This distinction is fundamental to understanding the purpose and limitations of Aadhaar.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act stipulated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This time limit is a crucial safeguard for privacy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  This restriction is a key aspect of the court's decision.

Statement 4 is correct. The Supreme Court did indeed uphold the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, but with significant conditions to protect privacy and other fundamental rights.  These conditions are central to the court's acceptance of the Act.

Therefore, only statement 4 is correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Tribunal system in India:**

1. Tribunals are established solely by the Constitution of India.
2.  The Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) adjudicates disputes related to the services of persons appointed to public services connected with the affairs of the Union.
3.  Appeals from tribunals always lie with the Supreme Court.
4.  Article 323B allows for the creation of tribunals on any subject matter under the purview of the legislature.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Tribunals are established through Acts of Parliament, not solely by the Constitution.  This is a key difference between the constitutional and statutory basis for judicial bodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CAT's jurisdiction specifically includes adjudicating disputes and complaints related to recruitment and service conditions of public servants appointed to positions connected with Union affairs.  This is a core function of the CAT.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Appeals from tribunals typically lie with the High Court, unless a specific law mandates that appeals go directly to the Supreme Court.  This variation is a key aspect of the appellate structure.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Supreme Court's 2010 clarification regarding Article 323B affirmed the power of legislatures to establish tribunals on various subject matters falling under their jurisdiction.  This flexibility is a vital aspect of the tribunal system’s design.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements about Contempt of Court:**

1.  Contempt of Court is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1972.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders.
3.  Criminal contempt includes interfering with the administration of justice.
4.  Only the Supreme Court has the power to punish contempt.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Contempt of Court is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not 1972. This minor difference in the year is a potential distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. Civil contempt indeed involves willful disobedience of court orders, judgments, decrees, or other processes.  This is a core aspect of civil contempt.

Statement 3 is correct.  Criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court, prejudice judicial proceedings, or obstruct the administration of justice.  These actions represent a threat to the integrity of the judicial process.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish contempt under Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively.  This shared power is a fundamental aspect of the judicial system.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:

1.  The President's power is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution.
2.  This power extends to all offenses, irrespective of the convicting court.
3.  The President can only grant pardons, not commute sentences.
4.  The power does not extend to cases involving offenses against state laws.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate regarding the President's constitutional powers on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases.  Statement 2 is incorrect because Article 72 specifically limits the President's power to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial, for an offense against a Union law, or a death sentence.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the President can commute sentences (reduce the severity of punishment). Statement 4 is incorrect as the President's power extends to offenses against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends, which encompasses a broad range of offenses.  Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions.


2. Consider the following regarding curative petitions in the Supreme Court:

Which of the above statements accurately describe the aspects of curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only (b) 1 and 4 only (c) 2, 3, and 4 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of curative petitions.  A curative petition is indeed the last available legal recourse in the Supreme Court after the dismissal of a review petition (1).  The Supreme Court's power to grant curative relief stems from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice (2). Grounds for filing a curative petition include violations of principles of natural justice, non-disclosure of relevant information by judges, and apprehensions of bias (3). The Rupa Ashok Hurra case is a landmark judgment that established the framework and guidelines for curative petitions in India (4).  Therefore, all the statements correctly represent the characteristics of curative petitions.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; SCS is granted to states facing significant developmental challenges. Statement 2 is incorrect; the criteria for SCS are not determined by the PMO but rather through various government processes and commissions, notably Finance Commissions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Fifth Finance Commission, not the 15th, was the first to introduce the concept of SCS. Statement 4 is correct; SCS provides additional central assistance to help bridge the developmental gap.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 4) accurately reflect the features of SCS.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the 2019 CPA explicitly includes online transactions within its definition of consumer transactions. Statement 2 is also correct; the CPA, 2019 established the CCPA as a central authority for consumer protection. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CPA, 2019 did not abolish the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission; it reformed and strengthened it.

Statement 2 is also correct; the judgment was made in a writ petition concerning the Great Indian Bustard's protection.

2.  The CBI is a statutory body established under the Indian Constitution.
3. The Director of the CBI is selected by a panel comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.
4. The CBI's motto is "Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity."

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CBI's establishment in 1963 directly followed the Santhanam Committee's recommendations on preventing corruption.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBI is a non-statutory body, operating under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, not a constitutional body.  Statement 3 is correct.  The selection process for the CBI Director involves the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Chief Justice of India, reflecting the sensitive nature of the appointment and the need for consensus among key branches of government. Statement 4 is also correct; this is the officially stated motto of the CBI. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  The Abhiyan utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.
4.  The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate: The core objective of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to increase public involvement in PDP creation. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the initiative was launched in 2018, it was under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development, and the name was "Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas." Statement 3 is correct; the PDI is a key tool used to pinpoint areas needing improvement. Statement 4 is also correct; the e-Gram Swaraj portal serves as the platform for publishing approved GPDPs. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements about the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL was inaugurated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
2.  It aims to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies.
3.  iCAL primarily focuses on enhancing the independence of state-level government auditors.
4. It serves as a knowledge hub and think tank for addressing governance issues at local levels.


How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai. Statement 2 is correct; a key goal of iCAL is to set global standards for auditing local governance. Statement 3 is partially correct but needs clarification. While iCAL aims to improve the independence of local government auditors, its scope is broader than just state-level auditors. It focuses on all levels of local government. Statement 4 is correct; iCAL functions as a knowledge center and think tank for tackling local governance challenges. Thus, only two statements are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following aspects of India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, including central GST, between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among different states based on criteria like population and area.
3.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided by the Union Government as per Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments require the Union Government's prior consent before borrowing money from foreign sources.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Finance Commission plays a crucial role in distributing tax revenues between the Union and States. Statement 2 is incorrect; vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool, not the distribution among states. Horizontal devolution is the distribution among states. Statement 3 is correct; Article 275 explicitly allows for grants-in-aid. Statement 4 is correct; state governments need Union approval for foreign borrowing, reflecting the federal structure's constraints on individual states' fiscal autonomy.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The criteria for granting SCS are solely based on geographical disadvantages.
2.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
3.  States granted SCS receive preferential treatment in terms of central government funding and planning.
4.  The grant of SCS is a permanent status and cannot be revoked.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SCS considers both geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. Statement 2 is correct; the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations led to the introduction of SCS. Statement 3 is correct; SCS provides advantages in central funding and developmental planning. Statement 4 is incorrect; SCS is not permanent and can be reviewed and potentially revoked.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. The DPBI is responsible for imposing penalties for data breaches.
2.  The DPBI's decisions are subject to appeal in the Supreme Court of India.
3.  Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected individuals in case of a data breach.
4.  The DPBI can designate any data fiduciary as a Significant Data Fiduciary (SDF) based on factors like the volume and sensitivity of data processed.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the DPBI has the power to levy penalties for violations. Statement 2 is incorrect; appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court. Statement 3 is correct; data fiduciaries have a legal obligation to inform the DPBI and affected individuals of breaches. Statement 4 is also correct; the DPBI has the authority to classify data fiduciaries as SDFs based on specified criteria.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the issuance of passports in India:**

1. The Indian government can issue passports to non-citizens in specific circumstances.
2.  There are four classes of passports issued in India: Ordinary, Diplomatic, Official, and Emergency.
3.  The Passport Act, 1920, is the primary legislation governing the issuance of passports in India.
4. The issuance of passports is solely under the purview of the Ministry of External Affairs.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the government can issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest.  Statement 2 is incorrect; there are only three classes of passports: Ordinary, Diplomatic, and Official. There is no mention of an "emergency" passport class in the provided text. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text does not mention the exact legislation governing passport issuance.  Statement 4 is broadly correct, though other ministries might have a role in specific passport-related matters.  Therefore, only statement 1 and 4 are fully supported by the information provided.


**8. Consider the following about Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

1.  CSCs are a component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
2.  CSCs primarily serve urban populations in India.
3. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development.
4. CSCs offer services in various sectors, including G2C, B2C, and financial services.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; CSCs are one of the three pillars of NeGP. Statement 2 is incorrect; CSCs primarily cater to rural areas. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CSC SPV is under the Ministry of Electronics & IT. Statement 4 is correct; CSCs offer a wide range of services across different sectors. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI):**

1. The WPFI is released annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
2.  The WPFI ranks countries based on the level of press freedom experienced by journalists.
3.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 was above 160.
4.  The WPFI considers factors such as censorship, violence against journalists, and legal restrictions on the media.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; RSF publishes the WPFI. Statement 2 is correct; the index assesses the level of press freedom. Statement 3 is incorrect; India's ranking was 159, not above 160. Statement 4 is correct; the WPFI considers various factors affecting press freedom.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements on Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Parts of Sikkim are designated as Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
3.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas, except citizens of Nepal.
4.  The designation of Protected and Restricted Areas is primarily determined by ecological considerations.


Which of the following statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the provided text states that Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area. Statement 2 is correct; parts of Sikkim are classified as Restricted Areas. Statement 3 is partially correct;  foreigners need special permits, but the exception is for citizens of Bhutan, not Nepal. Statement 4 is not entirely accurate; while ecological factors play a role, security concerns also influence the designation of these areas. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.


**1. Consider the following statements related to the President's powers:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences.
2.  The President's power extends to offenses against any law relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
3.  The President's mercy power applies only to cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial.
4. The President's power under Article 72 is subject to judicial review.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions regarding the President's power on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe aspects of this power. The President's power extends to cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial (Statement 3 is correct) and also to offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  However, Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has interpreted and clarified the scope of the President's powers, the power itself is not explicitly subject to judicial review in the same way a legislative act might be. The President's decision is largely discretionary, though it can be challenged on grounds of mala fide or violation of fundamental rights, but not on the basis of simple disagreement with the decision. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in India:**

1.  A curative petition is the last resort for someone whose review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed.
2.  The Supreme Court's curative power stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice.
3.  A curative petition can be filed if there's an apprehension of bias or if principles of natural justice were violated.
4.  The concept of curative petitions originated in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.
5.  A curative petition can be filed only if the petitioner proves the judge had a direct financial interest in the case.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the essential features of a curative petition in India's legal system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe key aspects of curative petitions in India.  A curative petition is indeed the final legal recourse available after a review petition is rejected by the Supreme Court (1).  The Supreme Court's power to grant curative relief stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice (2). Grounds for filing a curative petition include violations of principles of natural justice, apprehension of bias, or non-disclosure of connections by the judge (3), and the landmark case establishing the concept of curative petitions is *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr* (4). Statement 5, however, is too restrictive. While a direct financial interest would certainly be grounds, a curative petition can be filed for other reasons related to bias or procedural irregularities.  Therefore, four out of the five statements accurately describe curative petitions.


**3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme funded primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund.
2.  Their primary objective is to expedite the disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act.
3.  As of a certain point, over 750 FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO courts, were operational across many states.
4.  FTSCs are administered by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
5.  FTSCs are not connected to the National Judicial Data Grid.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the FTSCs in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the characteristics of FTSCs.  They are indeed a centrally sponsored scheme primarily funded by the Nirbhaya Fund (1), their main purpose is the swift resolution of rape and POCSO Act cases (2), and a significant number were functional across various states and union territories (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; FTSCs fall under the administrative purview of the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Statement 5 is also false; FTSCs are indeed linked to the National Judicial Data Grid for better data management and tracking of cases. Therefore, only three of the given statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding Zero FIRs in India:**

1.  A Zero FIR is registered regardless of where the offense occurred.
2.  The provision for Zero FIR is under Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.
3.  After registration, a Zero FIR is immediately transferred to the appropriate police station for investigation.
4.  A regular FIR number is assigned to a Zero FIR before it is transferred.
5.  The concept of Zero FIR was recommended by the Justice Verma Committee.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Zero FIR system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 accurately describe Zero FIRs. A Zero FIR can be filed at any police station, irrespective of the crime's location (1).  The legal basis for Zero FIRs is Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (2), and the recommendation for this system originated from the Justice Verma Committee's report (5). Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. While a Zero FIR is transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction, it's not immediate; some procedural steps are involved.  Also, a regular FIR number is *not* assigned initially; a new FIR number is assigned by the relevant police station after the transfer.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Doctrine of Coverture:**

1.  It's a legal doctrine originating from English common law.
2.  It treats a married woman and her husband as a single legal entity.
3.  It enhances a married woman's property rights and contractual capacity.
4.  The Supreme Court case *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* linked the Marital Rape Exception to this doctrine.
5.  It is still a fully applicable legal doctrine in modern India.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Doctrine of Coverture and its relevance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe the Doctrine of Coverture. It originated in English common law (1), treated a married woman as legally subsumed under her husband (2), and the Supreme Court case *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* highlighted its connection to the Marital Rape Exception (4).  Statement 3 is incorrect; the doctrine actually *restricted* a married woman's property rights and contractual capacity. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the doctrine of coverture is not a fully applicable legal doctrine in modern India.  It's largely obsolete, though its historical influence is relevant in understanding certain legal concepts. Therefore, only two of the statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following elements related to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction:**

1.  It's a principle used to reconcile seemingly conflicting legal provisions.
2.  It's primarily applied by lower courts, not the Supreme Court.
3.  It involves interpreting laws in a way that avoids contradictions and promotes consistency.
4.  The Supreme Court's application of this doctrine is always binding on lower courts.
5.  It is relevant to the Supreme Court's decisions concerning the Limitation Act.


How many of these statements correctly describe the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 accurately represent the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction. This doctrine is used to resolve apparent conflicts between different legal provisions (1), aiming for an interpretation that avoids contradictions and maintains overall consistency (3). The Supreme Court has indeed applied this principle in cases related to the Limitation Act (5). Statement 2 is incorrect; the Supreme Court frequently employs this doctrine. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while Supreme Court interpretations carry significant weight, they are not always absolutely binding on lower courts, especially concerning the application of the doctrine of harmonious construction, which requires contextual analysis.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following about Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They are located at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat.
3.  They have both civil and criminal jurisdiction to settle petty disputes.
4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
5.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the High Court.


How many of the above statements correctly describe Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 (1), are typically located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters (2), and handle both civil and criminal cases involving minor disputes (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; they are guided by principles of natural justice. Statement 5 is also incorrect; appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session (criminal) and the District Court (civil), not directly to the High Court.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following related to Contempt of Court in India:**

1.  It's defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their contempt powers from Articles 129 and 215, respectively.
3.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct justice.
4.  Only the Supreme Court can punish for contempt of High Courts.
5.  Contempt of court proceedings are immune from judicial review.


How many of the above statements accurately describe contempt of court in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe contempt of court.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines contempt (1); Articles 129 and 215 grant contempt powers to the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively (2); and the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is accurately stated (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; High Courts have inherent power to punish for contempt of their own orders. Statement 5 is also incorrect; contempt of court proceedings, while carrying significant weight, are not entirely immune from judicial review; they can be challenged on grounds of mala fide or violation of fundamental rights. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  It's a constitutional provision that mandates special assistance to certain states.
2.  The Fifth Finance Commission first introduced the concept of SCS.
3.  States granted SCS historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  The 14th Finance Commission led to the discontinuation of SCS.
5.  The Constitution explicitly defines criteria for granting SCS.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Special Category Status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Fifth Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS (2), states with SCS received funds based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula (3), and the 14th Finance Commission ended the formal system of SCS (4). Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution doesn't mandate SCS; it's a policy decision based on socio-economic factors and recommendations of Finance Commissions. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Constitution doesn't explicitly define criteria for granting SCS.  The criteria have evolved over time based on various factors.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It was established based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
3.  ADCs can have a maximum of 30 members, with at least 26 elected.
4.  ADCs and ARCs have limited powers, primarily executive in nature.
5.  The Sixth Schedule applies to all states with significant tribal populations.


How many of these statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the Sixth Schedule. It's based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations (1), empowers the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs (2), and ADCs have a maximum membership of 30, with a minimum of 26 elected members (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; ADCs and ARCs have considerable powers, including legislative and judicial powers in specified areas. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Sixth Schedule applies only to specific states—Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram—not all states with substantial tribal populations.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**11. Consider the following related to the formation of new states in India:**

1.  Article 3 outlines the procedure for forming new states or altering state boundaries.
2.  The Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states.
3.  A bill for state formation requires the President's recommendation to be introduced in Parliament.
4.  State reorganisation is exclusively the domain of the state legislatures.
5.  The Supreme Court's approval is mandatory for the formation of new states.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions on state formation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the constitutional process of state formation. Article 3 details the procedure for creating new states or modifying existing ones (1); Parliament can indeed form new states by combining parts of existing states (2); and the President's recommendation is required before a state formation bill is introduced in Parliament (3). Statement 4 is incorrect; state reorganization is a matter for the Parliament, not state legislatures. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court's approval is not mandatory for state formation, though judicial review is possible if the process is challenged on constitutional grounds. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**12. Consider the following regarding sub-classification of Scheduled Castes:**

1.  The Supreme Court has permitted sub-classification of Scheduled Castes to address varying degrees of backwardness.
2.  Sub-classification is explicitly prohibited under Article 341(2) of the Constitution.
3.  The state can sub-classify based on inadequate representation in state services.
4.  Sub-classification can lead to 100% reservation for a particular sub-caste.
5.  The state must provide data on the inadequacy of representation to justify sub-classification.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect the Supreme Court's stance on sub-classification of Scheduled Castes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the Supreme Court's position on sub-classification. The Court has allowed sub-classification of Scheduled Castes to address different levels of backwardness within the SC community (1).  The state can use inadequate representation in state services as a basis for sub-classification (3), and the state needs to justify sub-classification by providing data on underrepresentation (5). Statement 2 is incorrect; Article 341(2) doesn't prohibit sub-classification; it deals with the Parliament's power to modify the list of SCs. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court has clarified that sub-classification cannot lead to 100% reservation for any single sub-caste.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following statements about the Uniform Civil Code (UCC):**

1.  Article 44 of the Constitution directs the state to endeavor to secure a UCC.
2.  A UCC would replace all existing personal laws based on religion.
3.  Goa currently operates under a UCC.
4.  The UCC is a legally mandated requirement under the Constitution.
5.  The UCC would apply uniformly to all citizens regardless of their religion.


How many of these statements correctly describe the UCC in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. Article 44 of the Constitution does direct the state to work towards a UCC (1); Goa has a form of common civil code based on the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867 (3); and a UCC, if implemented, would apply uniformly to all citizens regardless of religion (5). Statement 2 is incorrect; a UCC would not necessarily replace *all* aspects of existing personal laws; it would aim for a unified system but might retain some elements of existing laws. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the UCC is a Directive Principle of State Policy, not a legally mandated requirement. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**14. Consider the following regarding the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991:**

1.  It aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it was on August 15, 1947.
2.  It allows for changes in the religious character of places of worship if mutually agreed upon by all parties involved.
3.  It prohibits the filing of any suits challenging the ownership of places of worship.
4.  It applies retrospectively to events before its enactment.
5.  It is intended to maintain communal harmony and prevent disputes.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Places of Worship Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the provisions of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.  The Act seeks to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947 (1); it applies retrospectively to events before its enactment (4); and it aims to promote communal harmony and prevent disputes over religious sites (5). Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act doesn't permit changes in the religious character of places of worship, regardless of mutual agreement. Statement 3 is also an oversimplification; the Act doesn't completely prohibit suits challenging ownership; it places restrictions on such suits.  Therefore, four statements accurately describe the Act's key features.


**15. Consider the following features of Cantonment Boards in India:**

1.  Cantonments primarily house military troops.
2.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
3.  The Ministry of Home Affairs has administrative control over Cantonment Boards.
4.  The Station Commander is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.
5.  Cantonments were first established by the British East India Company.


How many of the above statements correctly describe Cantonment Boards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Cantonments are primarily areas for military troops (1); they are governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006 (2); the Station Commander serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board (4); and the East India Company established the first cantonments (5).  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs, has administrative control over Cantonment Boards. Therefore, four of the statements are correct.


**16. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's approach to environmental issues?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the Supreme Court's approach to environmental matters. The Court has indeed linked the right to a healthy environment to Articles 14 and 21 (1),  this recognition arose in a case involving the Great Indian Bustard (2), and Articles 14 and 21 do guarantee the rights to equality and life, respectively (4). Statement 3 is incorrect; the Supreme Court has demonstrated a willingness to expand the scope of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the Court's approach evolves based on evolving scientific understanding and societal needs.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 accurately describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.

Statement 4 is incorrect; iCAL focuses on local governance bodies, not just state-level ones. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while iCAL may receive international collaboration, it's not exclusively funded by international organizations. Therefore, only three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The issuance of a passport to a non-Indian citizen based on public interest.
2.  The exemption of certain individuals from passport requirements by the Central Government.
3.  The existence of three passport classes in India: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of passport issuance in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of the Indian passport system. The Central Government possesses the authority to grant passports to non-citizens if deemed necessary for public interest.  It also has the discretion to exempt specific individuals from the standard passport requirements.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect.  The CSC scheme is overseen by the CSC SPV, which is a separate entity established under the Companies Act, 1956, not solely managed by the Ministry.  CSCs cater to rural citizens, not exclusively urban populations.  Furthermore, CSCs offer services from various sectors—Government, private, and social—not just the Government sector. Only statement 4 is correct.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The WPFI 2024 was released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a non-governmental organization, not the United Nations.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the DGPS's powers. The DGPS can make regulations on charges for services and the sale of postage stamps. Statement 3 is incorrect; the government, not the DGPS, has the power to intercept postal articles. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the DGPS is appointed at the national level, not by state governments.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The NHRC's accreditation was deferred by GANHRI, and it was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. Statement 2 is also incorrect; its headquarters is in New Delhi, not Mumbai.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Act specifically applies to the processing of *digital* personal data, not all forms of personal data.  Consent is not always required; it's exempted for certain legitimate uses. Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court. Only statement 2 is correct.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect. Cantonments are under the administrative control of the Union Government, not solely state governments. The first cantonment was established by the East India Company before independence. While Cantonment Boards do handle civic duties, their administration is a matter of Union Government jurisdiction. Only statement 4 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the RTI Act.  The RTI Act did replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. The Supreme Court has linked RTI to fundamental rights, specifically under Article 19.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the RTI Act was enacted in 2005, not 2002.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The MCC is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  While it applies during the election period, violations are not directly subject to criminal prosecution; they may lead to actions under other relevant laws. Although the Election Commission's authority stems from Article 324, the MCC itself doesn't have constitutional backing. Only statement 2 is correct.


**10. Consider the following about the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) implements the FCRA.
2.  NGOs can receive foreign funds without prior registration.

Only a maximum of 20%, not 50%, of foreign contributions can be used for administrative expenses. Only statement 1 is correct.


**11. Consider the following regarding the Centre-State financial relations:**

2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Centre but wholly assigned to states are mentioned in Article 269.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's fiscal federalism?

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Article 269 addresses taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to states.  The GST Council's recommendations are crucial in distributing GST revenue. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the Finance Commission plays a significant role, it's not the sole determinant. Statement 4 is also incorrect; fiscal federalism encompasses the sharing of funding responsibilities among federal, state, and local governments.


**12. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is partially a Protected Area.
2.  Sikkim is entirely a Restricted Area.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 3 and 4 are correct. Foreigners generally need special permits for Protected/Restricted Areas, and the 1963 Order governs access to Restricted Areas. Statement 1 is incorrect; Arunachal Pradesh is wholly a Protected Area. Statement 2 is also incorrect; Sikkim is partly Protected and partly Restricted.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF):**

1.  RTBF finds its roots in French jurisprudence, specifically the "right to oblivion."
2.  The Supreme Court of India, in the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy case, recognized RTBF as a component of the right to life under Article 21.
3.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates the "right to be forgotten."
4.  The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) includes provisions for the right to be forgotten.

How many of the above statements are accurate depictions of the Right to be Forgotten?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF). RTBF does indeed originate from the "right to oblivion" concept in French law, and the Puttaswamy judgment did recognize it as connected to Article 21's right to life.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, doesn't explicitly mention "right to be forgotten," though it addresses data protection principles that overlap with the concept.  Statement 4 is correct; the GDPR in the EU does encompass a right to be forgotten. Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, like the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, which deals with similar concepts but does not explicitly mention RTBF, adds to the question's difficulty.


**2. Consider the following features related to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in India:**

1.  It's a travel document issued by the central government allowing Indian citizens entry into restricted areas.
2.  The ILP system primarily aims to regulate movement near international borders.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The ILP system primarily regulates movement near international borders to ensure security, protects tribal cultures in northeastern India, and originated from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873.  However, statement 1 is incorrect because the ILP is issued by state governments, not the central government. Statement 5 is also incorrect; NRIs staying abroad for more than six months are *not* eligible for ILP; they require a Protected/Restricted Area Permit.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to identify the inaccuracies in the seemingly plausible statements.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the tax bases between the Union and States.

3.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in the distribution of revenues between the Union and States.
4.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among States.
5.  Horizontal devolution refers to the share of States from the divisible pool of taxes.

How many of the above statements accurately describe elements of India's fiscal federalism framework?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Seventh Schedule does define tax bases, the Finance Commission is vital for revenue distribution, and vertical devolution is about sharing funds between the Union and States. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Article 268 deals with taxes collected by the Union but assigned to the States, not all Union taxes.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; horizontal devolution is about the distribution of funds *among* states, not the share from the divisible pool. The question's difficulty stems from the subtle differences between closely related concepts, requiring a thorough understanding of fiscal federalism.


**4. Consider the following statements about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  SCS is granted to States facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages to aid their development.
2.  The Fifth Finance Commission first introduced the concept of SCS in 1969.
3.  SCS grants States complete financial autonomy from the Union government.
4.  Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have recently demanded SCS.
5.  The allocation of resources under SCS is determined solely based on population size.

Which of the above statements correctly characterize the Special Category Status (SCS) in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  SCS is indeed given to disadvantaged states, the Fifth Finance Commission introduced it, and Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have sought it.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; SCS doesn't grant complete financial autonomy; it provides additional central assistance. Statement 5 is also false; resource allocation under SCS considers various factors beyond just population.  The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between partially true and entirely true statements regarding SCS.


**5. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, and commute sentences.
2.  The President's power extends to all offenses, regardless of the court's jurisdiction.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the President's powers regarding mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 4, and 5 are correct. Article 72 grants the President pardon powers, mercy petitions can be filed after appeals, and the President's power specifically includes death sentences. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the President's power is limited to specific offenses, as defined in Article 72. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the President's decision is generally not subject to judicial review, though the Supreme Court has made observations in certain cases. The question assesses knowledge of constitutional provisions and the limitations on presidential powers.


**6. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in India:**

1.  A curative petition is the last resort available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  Curative petitions were established through the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra.
3.  The power to hear curative petitions stems from Article 142 of the Constitution.
4.  A curative petition can be filed only if there is evidence of bribery influencing the judgment.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the process and legal basis of curative petitions in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Curative petitions are a final recourse after review petitions, they were established through the Hurra case, and Article 142 provides the basis for the Supreme Court's power.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; while a curative petition can be filed for various reasons including violation of natural justice, the grounds are broader than just bribery.  Statement 5 is also incorrect; there is no specific timeframe for hearing curative petitions. This question tests knowledge of legal procedures and constitutional provisions, requiring differentiation between specific and general grounds for filing a curative petition.


**7. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019.
2.  FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in India?


(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. FTSCs are centrally sponsored, handle rape and POCSO cases, and aim for speedy disposal.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; they are funded from the Nirbhaya Fund, a central scheme. Statement 5 is also incorrect; FTSCs are part of the regular judicial system, not separate from it.  The question tests knowledge of government schemes and their operational aspects, requiring the candidate to distinguish between funding sources and the court's place within the overall judicial framework.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are correct. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the 2008 Act, have jurisdiction over civil and criminal matters, and are located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; they are not bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but by principles of natural justice. Statement 4 is also incorrect; appeals go to the Court of Session (criminal) and District Court (civil), not directly to the High Court.  The question tests knowledge of the judicial system's alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and their operational details.


**9. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court:**

1.  Contempt of Court is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish for contempt.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The 1971 Act defines contempt, both Supreme Court and High Courts have powers, civil contempt involves disobedience, and criminal contempt includes scandalizing courts.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; the Act does not provide a detailed appeals process.  The question assesses knowledge of the legal framework of contempt of court and its procedures.

(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. iCAL is in Rajkot, aims to set global standards, and promotes auditor independence. However, statement 3 is incorrect;  its funding sources are likely collaborative, not solely central government. Statement 5 is also incorrect; it addresses broader governance issues, not just finance. The question assesses knowledge of specific institutions and their functions within the governance landscape.  The plausible distractors regarding funding sources and the scope of iCAL’s activities make the question more challenging.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act applies to processing within India and for goods/services offered in India, it sets up the DPBI, and it includes penalties for breaches.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; consent is not required for all processing, only when not for legitimate purposes. Statement 5 is also incorrect;  the Act doesn't explicitly mention “right to be forgotten”. The question tests knowledge of specific legislation and its nuances, requiring a precise understanding of its scope and limitations.


**12. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:**

However, statement 2 is incorrect; the primary governing act is not the 1898 act, although it’s a significant part of its history. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Post Office isn't entirely free from liability. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while there are provisions for misuse, the Act doesn’t have stringent penal provisions. The question tests knowledge of the history and legal framework of the Indian Postal Department.

The DPBI's role in identifying and notifying Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) is also a core part of its mandate.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided statements.

How many of these features are correctly associated with the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately describe aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan. The campaign's core objective is to increase citizen participation in the development planning process at the Panchayat level. Its launch date and name, the multi-tiered implementation involving various stakeholders, the structured meetings for plan formulation, and the use of the PDI for gap analysis are all correctly stated.  There is no conflicting or inaccurate information presented.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1.  The CBI was established in 1963 based on the Santhanam Committee's recommendations.
2.  It functions under the Ministry of Home Affairs.
3.  The CBI is a statutory body established by the Constitution of India.
4.  The CBI Director's selection involves the Prime Minister, Leader of Opposition, and Chief Justice of India.
5.  The CBI's motto is "Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity."

How many of these statements accurately describe the CBI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Only two statements are entirely correct. Statement 1 is correct: the CBI's establishment in 1963 followed the Santhanam Committee's recommendations. Statement 5 is also correct:  "Industry, Impartiality, and Integrity" is the CBI's motto. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the CBI falls under the Ministry of Personnel, Pension & Public Grievances, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-statutory body, not established by the Constitution. While the selection process for the CBI Director involves the mentioned individuals (statement 4),  the provided text does not explicitly state the exact composition of the selection panel.  Therefore, only two statements are definitively accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1.  The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report by a Chief Ministers' Sub-Group.
2.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes aligning with the National Development Agenda and Vision 2022.

(b) 2, 3, and 5
(c) 1, 3, and 5
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 5 are accurate. The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report. The number of CSSs and their approximate share of the central budget are also correctly stated. The varying funding patterns based on state location (North Eastern and Himalayan states receiving different treatment) and legislative status (Union Territories without legislatures) are also true.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate in that the schemes do not necessarily need to align with Vision 2022 (the text only mentions that they *can* relate to this). Statement 4 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that funds are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.


**5. Consider the following concerning the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat.

How many of the above statements correctly describe iCAL?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe iCAL. Its location in Rajkot, its goal of setting global auditing standards, and its function as a knowledge center for grassroots governance are all explicitly mentioned. Statement 5 is also correct as its main goal is to improve the independence of local government auditors.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the President's powers concerning mercy petitions?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the President's power under Article 72. The power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., the applicability to court-martial sentences, and the power to commute death sentences are all explicitly stated. Statement 3 is partially true but misleading; the power extends to offenses against any law relating to a matter within the Union's executive power, not exclusively to such offenses. Statement 5 is incorrect; the President's decision is not subject to judicial review. Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


**7. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

2. It is enshrined under Article 244(2).
3. It grants special autonomy to certain tribal areas in the Northeast.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Sixth Schedule.  It's origin in the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, its constitutional basis in Article 244(2), its focus on granting special autonomy to tribal areas in Northeast India, and its provision for the establishment of autonomous district councils are all correct.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule does not mandate the inclusion of *all* tribal areas; it applies to specific areas as determined by the Indian Parliament.


**8. Consider the following regarding Parliamentary Committees:**

1.  Parliamentary Committees are appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker.
2.  They operate under the direction of the President of India.
3.  Their reports are presented to the House or Speaker.

How many of the above statements correctly describe Parliamentary Committees?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 accurately describe Parliamentary Committees. Their appointment process, the submission of reports, their constitutional basis (Articles 105 and 118 relating to privileges and rules of procedure), and the composition of the Estimates Committee are all correct.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; Parliamentary Committees operate under the direction of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha (or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, depending on the committee), not the President of India.


**9. Consider the following regarding the devolution of funds between the Union and States:**

How many of these statements accurately describe the financial relations between the Union and States in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The distribution of Union-levied taxes, the definition of horizontal devolution and its criteria, the constitutional basis for grants-in-aid (Article 275), and the role of the Finance Commission in resource allocation are all accurately stated.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool, not the distribution among states *from* their allocated share (that's horizontal devolution).


**10. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  SCS is a classification given by the Centre to assist in the development of disadvantaged states.
2.  It was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
3.  SCS states used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
5.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, SCS ceased to exist.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Special Category Status in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The purpose of SCS, its introduction date, and the use of the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for grant allocation are all correct. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the Constitution does *not* explicitly provide for SCS. Statement 5 is also inaccurate; while the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to a change in the approach to special funding, SCS didn't entirely cease to exist; the system evolved.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power of mercy:**

1.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
2.  Article 72 exclusively deals with pardons for offenses against Union laws.
3.  The President can pardon individuals convicted by court-martial.
4.  The President's power is absolute and cannot be judicially reviewed.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. This includes the power to commute a death sentence to a lesser punishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 72 deals with pardons for offenses against laws to which the executive power of the Union extends, it's not exclusive to such offenses.  It also covers cases where sentences are awarded by court-martial.

Statement 3 is correct.  The President's power to pardon extends to cases where the sentence is given by a court-martial.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the President's power is significant, it's not absolute. The exercise of this power can be subject to judicial review in certain limited circumstances, primarily concerning the fairness and due process involved in the decision-making process.  The courts can intervene if the President's decision is arbitrary or mala fide.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  They are available only after a review petition is dismissed.
2.  Their basis lies solely in Article 137 of the Constitution.

4.  The Rupa Ashok Hurra case significantly shaped their procedural aspects.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after their review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 137 provides the basis for review petitions, the power to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 142 (power of the Supreme Court to do complete justice), which allows the court to address exceptional situations where justice demands it.

Statement 3 is correct. One of the grounds for filing a curative petition is the allegation of a violation of the principles of natural justice, including the failure of a judge to disclose a conflict of interest or an apprehension of bias that might have influenced the judgment.

Statement 4 is correct.  The *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.* case established the framework for curative petitions in India, clarifying their procedure and grounds for consideration.


**3. Consider the following features of the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They are funded entirely by state governments.
2.  Their primary focus is on cases under the POCSO Act.
3.  They are a centrally sponsored scheme.
4.  Their establishment is overseen by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are funded primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund, a centrally managed fund. While states may contribute, the central government bears the significant financial burden.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of rape cases, including those under the POCSO Act.  While they handle other cases, POCSO cases are a major focus.

Statement 3 is correct. FTSCs operate as a centrally sponsored scheme, indicating joint funding and implementation by the central and state governments.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for the implementation of the FTSC scheme.


**4.  Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

1.  It mandates the appointment of a Data Protection Officer for all data fiduciaries.
2.  Penalties for non-compliance can reach ₹250 crore.
3.  It completely prohibits the transfer of personal data outside India.
4.  Exemptions are provided for processing data for national security purposes.

Which of the above statements are correct?


(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act mandates a Data Protection Officer only for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs), not all data fiduciaries.  The criteria for designating an entity as an SDF include the volume and sensitivity of data, risks to data principals, and potential impacts on national security.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act provides for significant penalties for various offenses, including a maximum penalty of ₹250 crore for failure to take security measures to prevent data breaches.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act allows for the transfer of personal data outside India, subject to certain conditions and restrictions imposed by the government.  It doesn't completely prohibit such transfers.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Act provides exemptions for the processing of personal data in the interest of national security, public order, and other specified reasons.


**5. Consider the following regarding the provisions of the Sixth Schedule to the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

4.  It grants special autonomy to the states under its purview.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution following the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, which addressed the governance needs of tribal areas in Assam.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule applies specifically to certain states, mainly in the Northeast, but not uniformly to all states in the region.  The specific states and areas covered are listed in the Schedule itself.

Statement 3 is correct. The primary purpose of the Sixth Schedule is to provide a framework for the administration of tribal areas within the specified states, granting them a degree of autonomy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule provides for autonomy, it doesn't grant "special autonomy" to the states themselves.  The autonomy is granted to the tribal areas within those states through the creation of autonomous district councils and regional councils.  The states retain overall jurisdiction.


**6. Consider the following aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1.  They are primarily funded by the state governments.
2.  Their funding pattern is uniform across all states.
3.  They aim to address national development goals.
4. NITI Aayog has a role in their monitoring.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are centrally sponsored, meaning the central government provides a significant portion of the funding, although there is a sharing of funds between the central and state governments depending on the scheme and the state's categorization (e.g., North Eastern states receive a higher share of central funding).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding pattern in CSSs varies depending on the scheme and the state (different ratios of central to state funding exist for different states and schemes).  North Eastern and Himalayan states often have different funding arrangements compared to other states.

Statement 3 is correct.  CSSs are designed to support national development priorities and goals, requiring collaboration between the central and state governments.

Statement 4 is correct. NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of CSSs, ensuring their alignment with national priorities and promoting efficient resource allocation.


**7. Consider the following regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1. It is a constitutional body.
2. It is responsible for investigating complaints related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3.  It has the power to summon witnesses and examine documents.
4. Its recommendations are binding on the government.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. One of the key functions of the NCSC is to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and take appropriate action.

Statement 3 is correct.  The NCSC has the power to summon witnesses, examine documents, and conduct inquiries to effectively investigate complaints and make recommendations.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the NCSC's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the government.  The government is expected to consider these recommendations seriously but retains the discretion to accept or reject them.  However, non-compliance can be a subject of parliamentary scrutiny.


**8. Consider the following statements about the  Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023:**

1. It replaces the Indian Evidence Act of 1872.
2.  It mandates forensic investigation for all criminal cases.
3.  It allows for the electronic submission of oral evidence.
4. It introduces provisions for joint trials in specific situations.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, is intended to replace the outdated Indian Evidence Act of 1872, modernizing the legal framework for admissibility of evidence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act does not mandate forensic investigation for *all* criminal cases.  It specifies forensic investigation as mandatory for offenses punishable by at least seven years of imprisonment.

Statement 3 is correct.  A significant provision of the new Act is the allowance for the electronic submission and recording of oral evidence, adapting to modern technological advancements.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Act introduces provisions for joint trials, particularly when an accused has absconded or failed to respond to an arrest warrant.  This streamlines the judicial process in certain circumstances.


**9. Consider the following related to the  Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024:**

1. They apply only to examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.
2. They mandate the filing of an FIR in every case of suspected unfair means.

4. They came into force in October 2024.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules apply to *public* examinations, which is a broader category than just UPSC examinations.  Any public examination where the rules are adopted would fall under their purview.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The rules stipulate that a venue-in-charge should take appropriate action *if a prima facie* case of unfair means is reported. This does not automatically mandate an FIR in every instance; it depends on the assessment of the situation.

Statement 3 is correct. The rules provide for the constitution of a committee to investigate cases of suspected unfair means where the management or board of directors of a service provider is involved in the misconduct.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The rules came into force in June 2024, not October 2024.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. Its members serve a five-year term.
2. Appeals against its decisions go to TDSAT.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The members of the DPBI are appointed for a term of two years, not five years.  They are eligible for reappointment.

Statement 2 is correct. Appeals against the decisions of the DPBI lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).

Statement 3 is correct.  The DPBI has the authority to monitor compliance with data protection regulations and impose penalties for violations, including those related to data breaches.

Statement 4 is correct.  Data principals (individuals whose data is being processed) have several rights under the Act, including the right to obtain information about the processing of their data and the right to seek correction or erasure of inaccurate or incomplete data.

3.  The campaign involves structured meetings at various levels, including Gram Sabhas and District Sabhas.
4. The campaign mandates the use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) for identifying thematic development gaps.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the key aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements accurately describe features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  The core aim is to increase citizen involvement in PDP creation (1).  It began as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" (2), highlighting its inclusive approach.  The structured meetings at different Panchayat levels are a crucial component of its implementation strategy (3). Finally, the utilization of the PDI to pinpoint thematic gaps is integral to the planning process (4).  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the provided statements.

1. It comprises 30 members elected through proportional representation.
2. Its primary function is to investigate breaches of parliamentary privileges.
3.  The Chairperson is appointed by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.
4. It submits recommendations directly to the Prime Minister.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha does have 30 members (20 Lok Sabha, 10 Rajya Sabha) elected via proportional representation (1). Its main role is investigating and addressing violations of parliamentary privileges (2). The Rajya Sabha Chairman appoints the Committee's Chairperson (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Committee submits its recommendations to the President, not the Prime Minister (4).


**3. Consider the following statements about Cabinet Committees of the Union Government:**

1. They are explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution.
2.  Their establishment is governed by the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.

4.  Only Cabinet Ministers can be members of these committees.

How many of these statements are accurate concerning the Union Government's Cabinet Committees?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are partially correct, while 1 and 4 are incorrect. Cabinet Committees are *not* explicitly mentioned in the Constitution (1), but their formation is indeed outlined in the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961 (2).  While the Prime Minister chairs *some* key committees (like the Political Affairs Committee), not all Cabinet Committees are chaired by the Prime Minister (3). Finally, while Cabinet Ministers predominantly form the membership, the rules do not entirely exclude non-Cabinet Ministers (4).


**4. Consider the following regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections:**

1. It's a set of guidelines established solely by the Election Commission of India (ECI).
2.  Its legal basis is explicitly stated in Article 324 of the Constitution.
3.  The MCC applies only to political parties and their candidates.
4.  Violation of the MCC leads to direct criminal prosecution under the Indian Penal Code.


How many of the above statements accurately depict the Model Code of Conduct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is partially correct. The MCC is a set of guidelines developed by the ECI in consultation with political parties, not solely by the ECI.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Article 324 empowers the ECI but doesn't explicitly mention the MCC. Statement 3 is incorrect because the MCC also applies to the government in power and government employees.  Statement 4 is incorrect; while violations can have consequences, they aren't directly prosecuted under the IPC but through other relevant statutes.


**5. Consider the following aspects of Lok Sabha elections:**

1.  They utilize a system of territorial representation.
2.  Each constituency elects multiple representatives.
3.  The candidate with the highest number of votes wins.
4.  The election system is based on proportional representation.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Lok Sabha election system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. Lok Sabha elections employ territorial representation, where each constituency elects one representative. Statement 2 is incorrect; each constituency elects only one representative (single-member constituency). Statement 3 is partially correct; the candidate with a plurality (most votes), not necessarily a majority, is declared the winner. Statement 4 is incorrect; the system is based on the first-past-the-post system, not proportional representation.


**6. Consider the following statements related to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
2.  ADCs have limited powers, primarily executive in nature.
3.  The Sixth Schedule applies to all states in India.
4.  The Panchayats Extension to Scheduled Areas Act (PESA) applies to Sixth Schedule areas.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule does grant the Governor the power to form ADCs and ARCs. Statement 2 is incorrect; ADCs have extensive powers, including legislative and judicial powers. Statement 3 is incorrect; it applies only to specific states (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram). Statement 4 is incorrect; PESA does not apply to Sixth Schedule areas.


**7. Consider the following regarding the procedure for the formation of new states in India:**

1. The power to form new states rests with the state legislative assemblies.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state requires the President's recommendation.

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against both Union and State laws, including death sentences.  The jurisdiction is not limited to offenses solely against the Union.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not entirely immune to judicial review. Courts can examine whether due process was followed or if the decision was arbitrary or capricious.

Statement 3 is correct. The President can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment or any other appropriate sentence. This is a crucial aspect of the President's power to temper justice with mercy.

Statement 4 is correct.  Generally, mercy petitions are filed only after all avenues of appeal within the court system have been exhausted.  This ensures that the judicial process is complete before the executive power of clemency is exercised.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice forms the basis for its jurisdiction to entertain curative petitions.  This power allows the court to rectify any injustice that may have occurred in the lower courts.

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect key provisions of the CAA, 2019. The Act does amend the Citizenship Act, 1955 (1),  lays out specific religious and geographical criteria for granting citizenship to illegal migrants (2), provides exemptions from certain penal consequences (3), shortens the naturalization period (4), and includes provisions for OCI registration cancellation (5).  Statement 6 is incorrect.  The ten-year period for citizenship mentioned in statement 6 refers to a separate provision, not directly part of the CAA, 2019. This statement describes a previous, distinct legal provision.  The other options incorrectly underestimate the number of accurate statements about the CAA's provisions.


**4. Consider the following about Foreigners Tribunals:**

1.  Established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964.
2.  They are quasi-judicial bodies.
3.  They have the sole power to declare a person a foreigner.
4.  Their powers are equivalent to those of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.
5.  The Supreme Court recently overturned a Foreigners Tribunal decision.
6. Exclusion from the National Register of Citizens automatically classifies a person as a foreigner.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the nature and function of Foreigners Tribunals in India?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately describe Foreigners Tribunals. They are established under the 1964 Order (1), are quasi-judicial (2), hold the sole authority to declare someone a foreigner (3), possess powers similar to civil courts (4), and their decisions are subject to judicial review, as evidenced by the Supreme Court's action (5). Statement 6 is incorrect. Exclusion from the NRC does not automatically make someone a foreigner; a Foreigners Tribunal's determination is necessary. Options (a), (c), and (d) either underestimate the number of correct statements or include the inaccurate statement 6.  This question tests factual knowledge of the legal framework surrounding citizenship determination in India.


**5. Consider the following regarding Mercy Petitions:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., is enshrined in Article 72.
2.  This power applies to sentences imposed by court-martials and for offenses against laws under Union executive power.
3.  It includes the power to commute death sentences.
4.  The President recently rejected a mercy petition of a Lashkar-e-Taiba terrorist.
5.  The power to grant pardons extends to cases where the sentence is for offenses against any law relating to a matter to which executive power of any State extends.
6.  The power to grant pardons only extends to cases where the sentence is for offenses against any law relating to a matter to which executive power of the Union extends.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the President's power concerning mercy petitions?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe the President's power regarding mercy petitions. Article 72 grants the President the power to grant pardons, etc. (1), including those from court-martials and offenses under Union executive power (2), and the power to commute death sentences (3). The rejection of a mercy petition is a real-world example (4). Statement 5 is incorrect because the power to grant pardons only extends to cases where the sentence is for offences against any law relating to a matter to which executive power of the Union extends.  Statement 6 is also incorrect, as it states the opposite of the actual constitutional provision.  Therefore, only four statements are accurate.  This question tests knowledge of the constitutional framework related to executive clemency.



**6. Consider the following aspects of Curative Petitions:**

1.  They are the last constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  They originated from the Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr. case.
3.  The Supreme Court's curative power stems from Article 142.
4.  A curative petition is admissible if principles of natural justice are violated.
5.  A curative petition can be filed if there is an apprehension of bias affecting the petitioner.
6.  A curative petition can be filed if the judge failed to disclose a connection to the subject matter.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics and admissibility of curative petitions in India?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately reflect the nature and grounds for filing a curative petition.  Curative petitions are the final recourse after review petitions are dismissed (1),  originated in the cited case (2), derive power from Article 142 (3), and are admissible if principles of natural justice are violated (4), or if bias is suspected (5), or if the judge failed to disclose a connection (6).  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements regarding the legal framework of curative petitions.  All options incorrectly suggest that some of these points are inaccurate. This question tests understanding of the Supreme Court's jurisdiction and the final avenues of legal recourse available to a litigant.


**7. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  They are a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019.
2.  They are funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.
3.  They are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.
4.  Their objective is to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and POCSO Act cases.
5.  A report by India Child Protection indicates they are highly efficient in handling such cases.
6.  Over 755 FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO courts, are functional across 30 states/UTs.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features and performance of Fast-Track Special Courts?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately describe FTSCs. They are a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 (1), funded by the Nirbhaya Fund (2), implemented by the Department of Justice (3), aim for swift disposal of relevant cases (4), have shown efficiency according to a report (5), and a significant number are operational (6).  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements.  This question tests knowledge of government schemes related to justice delivery and child protection.  All other options incorrectly suggest a lower number of accurate statements.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act:**

1.  It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2.  The Supreme Court established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19 in the *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government* case.
3.  It establishes Central and State Information Commissions.
4.  The Central Information Commission comprises a Chief Information Commissioner and up to ten Information Commissioners.
5.  Appointments to the Central Information Commission are made by the President.
6.  The RTI Act applies to all government bodies, state-controlled entities, and NGOs substantially financed by central or state governments.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect key aspects of the RTI Act, 2005?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are correct. The RTI Act replaced the 2002 Act (1), established information commissions (3), details the composition of the CIC (4), specifies the appointment process (5), and outlines the broad applicability of the Act (6). However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the *Raj Narayan* case was significant in shaping the understanding of information access, it did *not* establish RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.  The Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 19 has evolved, but it hasn't explicitly declared RTI itself a fundamental right. Therefore, only five statements are accurate.  This question tests knowledge of the RTI Act and its legal context.


**9. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule:**

1.  It's based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It empowers the Governor to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
3.  ADCs consist of a maximum of 30 members, with some nominated by the Governor.
4.  ADCs and ARCs have legislative and executive powers on specified subjects.
5.  The Sixth Schedule applies only to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
6.  The PESA Act, 1996, is applicable to areas under the Sixth Schedule.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions and applicability of the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately represent the Sixth Schedule. It's based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations (1), empowers the Governor to create councils (2), specifies the composition of ADCs (3), outlines the councils' powers (4), and limits its application to the four specified states (5). Statement 6 is incorrect. The PESA Act is separate legislation and is not directly applicable to areas under the Sixth Schedule, although there can be overlaps in the governance of tribal areas.  Therefore, only four statements are completely accurate. This question tests understanding of the constitutional provisions for the governance of tribal areas in Northeast India.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1.  First introduced in 1960 during Kerala state assembly elections.
2.  Guidelines laid down by the Election Commission of India (ECI).
3.  Govern the conduct of political parties and candidates during elections.
4.  Aim to ensure free and fair elections.
5.  The ECI recently issued directives on ethical social media usage related to MCC violations.
6.  The MCC is a legally binding document enforceable through criminal prosecution.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Model Code of Conduct?

(a) Only three (b) Only four (c) Only five (d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately describe the MCC. It was first introduced in 1960 in Kerala (1), is set by the ECI (2), governs the conduct of political actors (3), aims for free and fair elections (4), and the ECI's recent directives demonstrate its relevance in the digital age (5).  Statement 6 is incorrect. The MCC is not a legally binding document in the sense that it is not directly enforceable through criminal prosecution. It is a set of guidelines and its violation doesn't automatically lead to criminal charges.  Therefore, only five statements are entirely accurate.  This question tests understanding of election-related regulations and guidelines.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of divisible pool resources between the Union and States.
2.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of resources among states based on criteria like population and area.
3.  Article 293 allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India.
4.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided by the Centre as per Article 275.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Finance Commission, established under Article 280, plays a crucial role in recommending the vertical devolution of resources – the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes collected by the Union government.  The 15th Finance Commission, for example, recommended a 41% share for states.

Statement 2 is correct. Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of resources among states from the share allocated to them. The 15th Finance Commission used multiple criteria, including income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts to determine this distribution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly states that a state government can borrow only *within* India, not outside.  Borrowing from external sources requires the Union government's consent.

Statement 4 is correct. Article 275 empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states. These grants are usually provided to states that are financially weaker or require special assistance for specific development projects.

Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1. SCS is a constitutional provision explicitly defining criteria for granting special financial assistance to states.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants for SCS states.
3. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolition of SCS.
4. States with SCS received additional funding based on their geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 3 and 4 only (d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While SCS provided additional financial assistance based on the geographical and socio-economic disadvantages faced by certain states, it was not a constitutional provision explicitly defining the criteria.  The classification was based on recommendations of Finance Commissions and government discretion.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used to allocate funds to states granted Special Category Status.

Statement 3 is correct. Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS classification was abolished, although special funding mechanisms for some states (particularly in the Northeast and Himalayas) continued.

Statement 4 is correct. The core rationale behind granting SCS was to address the unique challenges faced by states due to geographical limitations or socio-economic backwardness.  This included providing extra financial assistance to bridge the development gap.


**3. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSS funding is entirely managed by the Union government.
2. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations significantly altered the funding pattern of CSSs.
3. CSSs are primarily implemented through states in sectors listed in the State and Concurrent Lists.
4.  NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the Union and state governments. The funding pattern varies depending on the scheme and the state involved.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to significant changes in the financial architecture of Centre-State relations. The abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017 made CSSs and Central Sector Schemes the primary instruments of specific-purpose transfers to states.

Statement 3 is correct. CSSs are implemented by state governments, but funding is shared by the Union and states.  The subject matter of these schemes typically falls under the State or Concurrent Lists of the Constitution's Seventh Schedule.

Statement 4 is incorrect. NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring and overseeing CSSs.  It has concurrent jurisdiction with other relevant ministries in this regard.  It also oversees third-party evaluations of CSS performance.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1.  The MCC is enshrined in the Constitution of India.
2. The Election Commission derives its authority for MCC from Article 324.
3. The MCC applies only during the election period.
4. Violations of the MCC are directly punishable under the Indian Penal Code.

Which of the following statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 3 only (d) None of the above

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI), not a constitutional provision.  Article 324 empowers the ECI to superintend, direct, and control elections, but it does not explicitly mention the MCC.

Statement 2 is correct.  The ECI's authority to issue and enforce the MCC is derived from its constitutional mandate under Article 324 to conduct free and fair elections.

Statement 3 is correct. The MCC is in effect from the announcement of the election schedule until the declaration of results.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While violations of the MCC can lead to serious consequences, including disqualification of candidates, they are not directly punishable under the Indian Penal Code.  However, certain provisions of the MCC can be enforced through corresponding provisions in other statutes, such as the Representation of the People Act, 1951.


**5. Consider the following regarding Aadhaar:**

1.  Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts.
2.  Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
3.  The Supreme Court declared Aadhaar unconstitutional in 2018.
4.  Aadhaar is primarily used as a proof of citizenship.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on Aadhaar clarified that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  While it can be required for accessing certain government welfare schemes, it cannot be universally mandated for all private services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling stipulated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This was a critical aspect of the judgment to protect privacy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court, in 2018, upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, but with certain caveats regarding privacy and data security.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address for residents of India.  It is not a proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. It provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states.
3. It covers the entire state of Sikkim.
4. It mandates the formation of autonomous district councils in all scheduled areas.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides a mechanism for the administration of tribal areas in four northeastern states – Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It outlines the creation of autonomous district councils and regional councils to manage local affairs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does not cover the entire state of Sikkim.  Sikkim has its own unique administrative arrangements.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule provides for the creation of autonomous district councils, it does not mandate their formation in *all* scheduled areas. The specific application of the Schedule is determined by the relevant state government.


**7. Consider the following about the Public Accounts Committee (PAC):**

1.  It was first established in 1950.
2.  It consists of members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.
3.  Its primary function is to audit the revenue and expenditure of the Union government.
4.  Its members are appointed by the President of India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PAC was first set up in 1921, in the wake of the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms, not in 1950. While it continued after independence, its origins predate 1950.

Statement 2 is correct. The PAC comprises members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, reflecting the bicameral nature of the Indian Parliament.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PAC's primary function is to examine the accounts showing the appropriation of sums granted by Parliament (and the state legislatures) and to scrutinize the Union government's revenue and expenditure.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Members of the PAC are elected by the Lok Sabha, not appointed by the President.  The Lok Sabha elects its members to the PAC, and the Rajya Sabha elects its members to the PAC.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991:**

1. It allows for the alteration of the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
2.  It aims to maintain the status quo of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
3.  It prohibits the filing of new suits challenging the ownership of places of worship.
4. It applies retroactively to all disputes concerning places of worship.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 2 only (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act explicitly aims to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947.  It does not permit alterations to this status.

Statement 2 is correct. The central objective of the Act is to freeze the religious character of places of worship as it existed on the date of India's independence.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act bars the filing of new suits challenging the existing status of places of worship, aiming to prevent further legal battles and maintain peace and harmony.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Act aims to maintain the status quo as it existed on August 15, 1947, it does not apply retroactively to all disputes.  Disputes that were already underway before the enactment of the Act might have continued under existing legal processes.  The Act is primarily prospective in its application.  


**9. Consider the following regarding the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. The DPBI is responsible for directing data fiduciaries to take measures during data breaches.
2. Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Supreme Court of India.
3. Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.
4. The DPBI appoints data protection officers for significant data fiduciaries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 2 and 4 only (c) 1, 2, and 3 only (d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. One of the key functions of the DPBI is to monitor compliance with data protection regulations and direct data fiduciaries (entities processing personal data) to take appropriate actions in case of data breaches.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against DPBI decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court of India.

Statement 3 is correct.  Data principals (individuals whose data is being processed) have the right to access, correct, and even request the erasure of their personal data under the data protection framework.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the DPBI oversees the data protection landscape, it doesn't directly appoint data protection officers.  Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) are required to appoint their own data protection officers as per regulations.


**10. Consider the following statements concerning the Union Government's borrowing powers:**

1. Article 292 allows the Union Government to borrow money both within and outside India.
2.  Article 293 restricts state governments from borrowing without the Union Government's consent.
3.  If a state is indebted to the Union, it needs the Union's prior consent for further borrowing.
4.  The Union Government can only borrow money from domestic sources.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only (b) 1, 2, and 3 only (c) 2 and 3 only (d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 292 grants the Union Government the power to borrow money both within and outside India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 allows state governments to borrow money *within* India, but it does not automatically require Union consent for all borrowing.  However, there is a condition:

Statement 3 is correct.  If a state government is already indebted to the Union, it requires the Union's prior consent for any further borrowing.  This is a crucial mechanism to manage overall fiscal stability and prevent excessive state-level debt.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Union Government has the power to borrow from both domestic and international sources.  This is a vital tool for managing the national economy and financing government programs.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of divisible pool among states.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among states based on criteria like population and area.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states under Article 275.
4.  The Union government can borrow money both within and outside India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's fiscal federalism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe elements of India's fiscal federalism.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending the distribution of the divisible pool of taxes between the Union and States (Article 280).  Grants-in-aid, provided under Article 275, are a significant tool for assisting states with their financial needs, particularly those facing revenue shortfalls. The Union government's borrowing powers, both domestically and internationally (Articles 292 and 293), are integral to its fiscal management and ability to fund national programs and initiatives.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While vertical devolution does involve the distribution of resources to states, it's primarily concerned with the share of states from the divisible pool.  Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, focuses on the distribution *among* states based on various criteria, as mentioned in the text.  Thus, the description of vertical devolution in statement 2 is an oversimplification.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission used income distance as a primary criterion for horizontal devolution.
2.  Special Category Status (SCS) is constitutionally mandated.
3.  States' revenue sources currently cover less than 60% of their revenue expenditure.
4.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to allocate grants to SCS states.

How many of the above statements are factually correct regarding India's fiscal federalism and state finances?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed gave significant weight to income distance in its formula for horizontal devolution among states. The text explicitly states that states' revenue sources cover only 58% of their revenue expenditure, highlighting a reliance on central government support. Lastly, the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used for allocating grants to states with Special Category Status (SCS).

Statement 2 is incorrect. The constitution doesn't explicitly provide for the categorization of states as SCS; it's a practice developed through Finance Commission recommendations and government policy.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are primarily funded by the state governments.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction.
3.  NITI Aayog has a role in monitoring Centrally Sponsored Schemes.
4.  The funding pattern for CSS in Northeastern states is different from other states.

Which of the above statements correctly reflect aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct regarding CSS. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations did lead to the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, significantly impacting the way central funds are allocated and utilized. NITI Aayog's role in monitoring and overseeing CSS is clearly mentioned in the text.  The funding pattern for core CSS in Northeastern and Himalayan states differs from other states (90:10 vs 60:40 Centre:State ratio).

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSS are jointly funded by the Centre and States, with the central government typically contributing a larger share. The implementation is carried out through state governments.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi focuses solely on training higher-level civil servants.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission was established as part of Mission Karmayogi.
3.  Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training.
4.  Mission Karmayogi's scope encompasses only permanent civil servants.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Mission Karmayogi?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect Mission Karmayogi's key features.  The Capacity Building Commission was indeed launched as a part of this initiative.  The shift from rule-based to role-based training and a competency-driven approach are central to Mission Karmayogi's philosophy.

Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is broader than just higher-level civil servants; it aims to improve the capacity of all civil servants, including contractual employees.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on Gram Panchayats.
2.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to identify developmental gaps.
3.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2024.
4.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves only elected representatives.


Which of the above statements accurately describes aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The PDI is a key component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, used to assess the developmental needs of Panchayats.

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves all three tiers of Panchayats, not just Gram Panchayats. It was launched in 2018, not 2024.  It involves various stakeholders, including elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is the first of its kind globally.
2.  The CAG's audit mandate for local bodies stems from the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts.
3.  AuditOnline is an application used for online auditing of local body accounts.
4.  The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) works independently of the CAG.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of auditing of local bodies in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies originates from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, although the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts laid the groundwork for local self-governance. AuditOnline is indeed an application used to conduct online audits of panchayat accounts.

Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect.  iCAL is the first of its kind in India, not globally. ELFA/DLFA work under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not independently.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar:**

1.  Aadhaar is a proof of both address and citizenship.
2.  Aadhaar data is stored decentrally for enhanced security.
3.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in 2018.
4.  The government can mandatorily require Aadhaar for all financial transactions.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the facts about Aadhaar?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court did indeed affirm the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in 2018.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Act's primary aim is to preserve the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Act does not allow for changes based on present-day needs. It applies to all places of worship, not just mosques and temples.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The UCC aims to create a uniform system of personal laws applicable to all citizens, irrespective of religion, covering matters such as marriage, divorce, and inheritance.

While they manage infrastructure and services within cantonment areas, their primary responsibility is not urban planning for entire cities.  Although the Ministry of Defence has a significant role in their administration, the land ownership and control are not exclusively under the Ministry's purview.  Some land may be under state control or other agencies.

(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The WPFI does indeed rank countries based on their press freedom levels.

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The WPFI is published by Reporters Without Borders, not the United Nations.  A higher rank actually indicates *less* press freedom (a rank of 1 is best, 180 is worst). The WPFI considers various media platforms, not just print media.

This reflects the government's flexibility in managing national security and international relations. Statement 3 is incorrect.  India issues three classes of passports: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon). The inclusion of the Official passport as a distinct category is a crucial detail often overlooked. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Ordinary passport is blue, not white.  The color-coding of passports serves as a vital visual identifier of the passport holder's status and associated privileges. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

This reflects the technological focus of the CSC initiative. Statement 2 is correct. CSCs are indeed a crucial pillar of the National e-Governance Plan, aiming to extend government services to rural areas. Statement 3 is incorrect. The NeGP includes three pillars: Connectivity, National Data Bank/State Data Centres, and CSCs.  The distinction between National Data Bank and State Data Centres is important for understanding the decentralized nature of data management. Statement 4 is incorrect. CSCs primarily serve rural citizens, bridging the digital divide. Statement 5 is incorrect. CSCs provide a broader range of services including G2C, business-to-citizen (B2C), and financial services.  The diversity of services underscores the comprehensive approach of the CSC initiative.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are partially correct (with minor inaccuracies).

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is the organization responsible for publishing the WPFI.  RSF's role in advocating for press freedom is globally recognized. Statement 3 is incorrect. RSF is headquartered in Paris, France, not Geneva, Switzerland. This detail is crucial for understanding the organization's geographical context. Statement 4 is incorrect. The WPFI 2024 assessed 180 countries, not 200. The number of countries included in the index can vary from year to year. Therefore, only statements 2 is correct.

(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only

The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to calculate grants for SCS states. Statement 3 is correct. Following the 14th Finance Commission, SCS as a formal category was discontinued, though special funding mechanisms for some states continue. Statement 4 is incorrect. Special packages can be given for various socio-economic reasons, not only geographical disadvantages. Statement 5 is correct.  Article 282 allows for discretionary grants, which includes special packages.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct.

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect because Cabinet Committees are extra-constitutional; they are not mentioned in the Constitution. Statement 3 is incorrect because while most members are Cabinet Ministers, non-Cabinet Ministers are not barred from membership. Statement 4 is incorrect as the Prime Minister chairs some, but not all, Cabinet Committees; for example, the Parliamentary Affairs Committee is chaired by the Home Minister. Statement 2 is correct as it accurately reflects the rules governing their establishment. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Parliamentary Committees:**

2.  Their authority is derived solely from the provisions of the Official Languages Act, 1963.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct: Parliamentary Committees are indeed appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker, and they submit their reports to the House or Speaker.  However, Statement 2 is incorrect; their authority is derived from Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution, not solely from the Official Languages Act.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the Lok Sabha Secretariat provides the secretariat for many, it doesn't provide for *all* Parliamentary Committees.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; the committee investigates breaches of privileges. Statement 3 is also correct; the Chairman is appointed by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 2 is correct: The President appoints the Chairperson and Members based on committee recommendations. Statement 3 is also correct:  The NHRC possesses powers similar to a civil court.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory body, established by the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not a constitutional body.

Statements 2 and 3 are correct; the Lokpal comprises a chairperson and up to eight members, with at least half being judicial members. Statement 4 is incorrect; the President appoints the Lokpal's members based on the recommendations of a selection committee. Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 4, after correcting statement 4) are correct.  Note that a corrected statement 4 could be considered correct.

3.  Violations of the MCC are directly prosecutable under criminal law.
4.  The Election Commission of India derives its authority for the MCC from Article 324 of the Constitution.


Which of the above statements are incorrect regarding the MCC?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the MCC is a set of guidelines laid down by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with political parties. Statement 2 is incorrect; it also applies to the government in power, government employees, and polling agents. Statement 3 is incorrect; violations are not directly prosecutable; however, some provisions are enforceable through related statutes. Statement 4 is correct; Article 324 empowers the ECI. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect.


**10. Consider the following regarding the State Election Commission (SEC):**

1.  It is constituted under the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992.
2.  It is responsible for conducting elections to the Parliament and State Legislative Assemblies.
3.  It advises the Governor on matters related to the conduct of local body elections.
4.  It has the power to decide disputes related to local body elections.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the SEC's functions?


(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; the 73rd and 74th Amendments provide for the SEC's constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect; the SEC conducts elections to local bodies, not Parliament or State Legislative Assemblies. Statement 3 is correct; it advises the Governor on local body election matters. Statement 4 is also correct; it has the power to decide related disputes. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the SEC's functions.



1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of divisible pool between the Union and States.
2.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based on criteria like population and area.
3.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Finance Commission, as per Article 280 of the Constitution, plays a crucial role in recommending the principles governing the distribution of the divisible pool of taxes between the Union and the States.  This ensures a fair and equitable distribution of resources.

Statement 2 is also correct. Horizontal devolution, a key aspect of fiscal federalism, involves the allocation of funds among states based on various factors, including income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest cover, and tax efforts.  This aims to address regional disparities and ensure balanced development.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance, particularly those with revenue deficits or specific development challenges.  These grants are crucial for ensuring a minimum standard of public services across all states.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Union government can borrow both within and outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only within India (Article 293).  This limitation reflects the federal structure and prevents undue financial risks at the state level.  Furthermore, if a state is already indebted to the Union, it needs prior consent for further borrowing.


2. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1.  SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
2.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
3.  States with SCS received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, SCS ceased to exist.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 1, 3, and 4 only (c) 1 only (d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The concept of Special Category Status (SCS) for certain states was indeed introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission. This was intended to provide additional financial assistance to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly mention the categorization of states as SCS states.  The provision of special assistance to states has been based on various commissions' recommendations and policy decisions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, states with SCS received financial assistance based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, which considered various factors related to their development needs.

Statement 4 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission significantly altered the approach to providing special assistance to states.  The SCS designation was effectively discontinued, and a different framework was adopted to address the needs of states facing unique challenges.  The current funding patterns are largely based on the recommendations of the Chief Ministers' Sub-Group rather than the SCS classification.


3. Consider the following regarding Cantonment Boards in India:

1.  Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey.
2.  The administration of cantonments falls under the purview of the state governments.
3.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.
4.  Currently, there are 61 cantonments in India, all established before independence.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonments, primarily areas housing military troops, have their origins in the British East India Company's rule.  Their establishment followed the Battle of Plassey, marking a significant stage in the company's consolidation of power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The administration of cantonments is a Union subject (Entry 3 of the Union List), not a state subject. This reflects the national security implications associated with military establishments.

Statement 3 is correct. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments.  Its alignment with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with local self-government, reflects the attempt to balance military needs with the provision of civic services to the civilian population within cantonments.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While most cantonments were established before independence, a few (6) have been established *after* independence. This shows that the cantonment system has continued to evolve and adapt to changing needs.


4. Consider the following statements regarding the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India:

1.  The Supreme Court has recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change under Articles 14 and 21.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in  ‘M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others’ relates to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.
3.  Articles 14 and 21 guarantee the fundamental rights to equality and life respectively.
4. The  judgment significantly restricts the scope of  Articles 21 and 14.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A landmark Supreme Court judgment has indeed recognized the right to a healthy environment and to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as flowing from the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution.  This has far-reaching implications for environmental protection and policy-making.

Statement 2 is correct. The case of ‘M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others’ did indeed concern the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.  The Court used this case as a vehicle to expand the scope of environmental rights.

Statement 3 is correct. Articles 14 and 21 are fundamental rights that are central to the Indian Constitution. Article 14 guarantees equality before the law and equal protection of the laws, while Article 21 guarantees the right to life and personal liberty.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The judgment, far from restricting the scope of Articles 21 and 14, actually *expanded* their interpretation to include environmental rights.  This demonstrates the judiciary's proactive role in interpreting and applying fundamental rights to address contemporary challenges.


5. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1.  The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It applies to the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh.
3.  It grants autonomy to tribal areas within certain states.
4.  It is mentioned under Article 244(3) of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, which provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, was indeed based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. This committee studied the governance challenges in these areas and proposed a framework for greater autonomy.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The Sixth Schedule applies to the *entire* state of Meghalaya and parts of other northeastern states,  not only Arunachal Pradesh. The areas covered are specified within the schedule itself.

Statement 3 is correct. The Sixth Schedule aims to grant a significant degree of autonomy to tribal areas, allowing them to manage their own affairs and preserve their distinct cultural identities.  It establishes autonomous district councils and regional councils with specific powers and responsibilities.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule is mentioned under Article 244(2), not Article 244(3).  This article deals with the special provisions for the administration of tribal areas in certain states.


6. Consider the following statements regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:

1.  Sikkim is entirely located within a Protected Area.
2.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area.
3.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas.
4.  Citizens of Bhutan do not need special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 2 and 3 only (c) 3 and 4 only (d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is partly located in a Protected Area and partly in a Restricted Area, not entirely within a Protected Area.  The division reflects the varying levels of access control needed for different regions within the state.

Statement 2 is correct.  The entire Union Territory of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands is designated as a Restricted Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963. This reflects the strategic importance of these islands and the need to control access for security reasons.

Statement 3 is correct.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, foreigners (excluding citizens of Bhutan) are generally not permitted to enter Protected or Restricted Areas unless they obtain special permits from the competent authorities. This is a crucial aspect of access control in these sensitive areas.

Statement 4 is correct. Citizens of Bhutan are exempted from the requirement of obtaining special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas. This reflects the special relationship between India and Bhutan and the greater freedom of movement for Bhutanese citizens in India.


7. Consider the following features of Gram Nyayalayas:

1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters.
3.  They are bound by the rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
4.  Appeals from their decisions are heard by the High Court.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas, village courts aimed at settling petty disputes, are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008. This Act provides the legal framework for their functioning and jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters of a petty nature, thereby bringing justice closer to the people at the village level.  This helps to reduce the burden on higher courts and promote speedy resolution of minor disputes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the technical rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They are guided by the principles of natural justice, which prioritize fairness and equity in the resolution of disputes.  This makes the process simpler and less formal.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Appeals from decisions of Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session in criminal cases and to the District Court in civil cases, not directly to the High Court. This reflects the hierarchical structure of the judicial system and provides a further level of appeal before reaching the High Court.


8. Consider the following statements concerning the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections:

1.  The MCC is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2.  It applies only to political parties and their candidates.
3.  Violation of the MCC is a criminal offence under the Indian Penal Code.
4.  The Election Commission derives its authority from Article 324 for superintendence, direction and control of elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only (b) 4 only (c) 2 and 3 only (d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  It's a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with political parties to ensure free and fair elections.  It's based on the ECI's constitutional powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC applies to a wider range of actors beyond just political parties and candidates. It also extends to the government in power and government employees to ensure neutrality and impartiality during the election period.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Violation of the MCC is not a criminal offense under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) as it lacks statutory backing. However, violations can lead to disqualification under relevant electoral laws and other actions.

Statement 4 is correct. Article 324 of the Constitution vests the Election Commission with the power of superintendence, direction, and control of elections to Parliament, State Legislatures, President, and Vice-President. This constitutional mandate allows the ECI to issue guidelines like the MCC to maintain the integrity of the electoral process.  This is the source of authority for the ECI's actions.



1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, but this Act exempts certain states and tribal areas.
2.  They function as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, with jurisdiction over both civil and criminal petty disputes.
3. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas are to be disposed of within six months of filing, regardless of the type of case.
4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence detailed in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, ensuring a standardized legal process.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, does exclude certain states and designated tribal areas from its purview.  Statement 2 is also correct; Gram Nyayalayas are indeed deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class and handle both civil and criminal cases of a petty nature. Statement 3 is partially correct in that the Act aims for speedy disposal of appeals, but the timeframe is not universally guaranteed or consistently met.  Crucially, statement 4 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; they operate under the principles of natural justice, allowing for greater flexibility in the admission of evidence. This flexibility is designed to facilitate quicker resolution of disputes at the village level.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:

1.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines and outlines the procedures for dealing with contempt.
2.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish for contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.
3.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct justice.
4.  The Jharkhand government's contempt petition against the Centre highlights the judiciary's limited power to enforce timely appointments.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of contempt of court in India. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework; Articles 129 and 215 grant the Supreme Court and High Courts the constitutional power to address contempt; and the distinction between civil and criminal contempt is correctly outlined. However, statement 4 is misleading. While the Jharkhand government's action demonstrates the judiciary's ability to initiate legal proceedings against the executive for perceived delays, it doesn't imply a *limited* power to enforce appointments.  The case highlights the judiciary's power to hold the executive accountable, not a limitation on its authority. Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


3. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:

1. It aims to enhance public participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3. The campaign involves structured Gram Sabhas and uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.
4. The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  The campaign's core objective is to increase public participation in PDP creation; it employs structured Gram Sabhas and utilizes the PDI to pinpoint areas needing development; and the approved GPDPs are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While the campaign's initial rollout was under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," it was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


4. Consider the following statements concerning the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):

1. iCAL is the first center of its kind in India, aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance.
2.  It primarily focuses on enhancing the independence of local government auditors to improve financial performance assessments.
3. iCAL's establishment is directly mandated by the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992.
4. It serves as a knowledge center and think tank addressing governance issues at the grassroots level.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe key aspects of iCAL. Its pioneering nature in India, its emphasis on auditor independence to bolster financial assessments, and its role as a knowledge hub for grassroots governance issues are all correct. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts laid the foundation for local self-governance, they did not directly mandate the creation of iCAL.  The establishment of iCAL is a subsequent initiative aimed at improving the auditing of local bodies established under these amendments.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


5. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1.  It allows the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specified states.
2.  ADCs consist of a maximum of 30 members, with some nominated by the Governor and others elected.
3.  The Sixth Schedule is based on recommendations from the Nehru Committee.
4.  ADCs and ARCs have powers over subjects such as land revenue collection and mineral royalty collection, but not forest management.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the Sixth Schedule's provisions for establishing ADCs and ARCs and their composition. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's framework stems from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. ADCs and ARCs *do* possess powers related to forest management, in addition to land revenue and mineral royalties.  Their extensive powers are designed to promote autonomy in the governance of scheduled areas.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


6. Consider the following regarding the procedure for the formation of new states in India:

1. Article 3 of the Constitution grants Parliament the power to form new states or alter existing ones.
2.  The President's recommendation is required before a bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in Parliament.
3.  The process involves a simple majority vote in both houses of Parliament.
4.  State legislatures play a significant role in initiating proposals for the formation of new states.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the constitutional provisions regarding state formation. Article 3 empowers Parliament, and the President's recommendation is a prerequisite. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While a simple majority is needed in each house, the process also involves considering various factors and may necessitate consultations with concerned states.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while state legislatures may express views, the initiative predominantly lies with the Parliament. Therefore only two statements are entirely correct.


7. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1. SCS was initially introduced based on recommendations from the Fifth Finance Commission.
2.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
3. States with SCS historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect historical developments concerning SCS.  The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations initiated the system; the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for allocating funds; and the 14th Finance Commission indeed ended the formal SCS categorization.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain a specific provision for granting SCS; it's a policy decision based on various financial and developmental considerations. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


8. Consider the following about the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India:

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is the primary legislation governing domestic arbitration.
2. The Act has undergone several amendments, including one in 2021 that allows for the unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards obtained through fraud or corruption.
3.  The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre (NDIAC) was established by the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021.
4.  The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is an Indian institution established to facilitate international commercial arbitration.


How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct; the 1996 Act is the cornerstone of domestic arbitration, and the 2021 amendment introduced provisions for staying awards obtained fraudulently.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The NDIAC was established by a separate Act in 2019, not as part of the 2021 amendment.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the PCA is an international institution based in The Hague, not an Indian one.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


9. Consider the following regarding Centre-State financial relations in India:

1.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union and distributed between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states from their allocated share based on various criteria.
3.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.
4.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275, while states' borrowing powers are outlined under Article 293.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 correctly outline aspects of Centre-State fiscal relations. Article 270 addresses tax distribution; the 15th Finance Commission's recommendation on the divisible pool is accurate; and the articles governing grants-in-aid and state borrowing are correctly cited.  However, statement 2 is incorrect.  Vertical devolution refers to the share of the divisible pool that is transferred from the Centre to the states, not the distribution *among* states from their allocated share (that's horizontal devolution).  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


10. Consider the following features of the Tribunal System in India:

1. Tribunals are established solely by acts of Parliament.
2.  Article 323A of the Constitution recognizes the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT).
3.  The Supreme Court's 2010 clarification expanded the scope of Article 323B to include any subject matter within the legislature's purview.
4.  Appeals from tribunals always lie directly with the Supreme Court.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Tribunals are established through legislation, and Article 323A specifically mentions the CAT. However, statement 3 is slightly inaccurate. While the 2010 Supreme Court ruling clarified that Article 323B is not restrictive, it didn't expand the article's scope beyond what was already implied. It simply reinforced the legislature's power to create tribunals. Statement 4 is also incorrect; appeals from tribunals typically go to the relevant High Court, although some legislation may specify the Supreme Court as the appellate authority.  Therefore, only two statements are completely accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring in-depth knowledge and careful analysis to avoid plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance the participation of citizens in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was initially launched under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas."
3.  Its implementation involves only elected representatives at the Panchayat level.
4.  The thematic approach adopted is based on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
5. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to identify thematic developmental gaps.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  The campaign explicitly aims to increase citizen involvement in PDP creation (1), was initially launched under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" (2), uses a thematic approach aligned with localized SDGs (4), and employs the PDI to pinpoint developmental gaps (5).  Statement 3 is incorrect; implementation includes elected representatives, government frontline workers, community-based organizations (CBOs), and other stakeholders, not solely elected representatives.  This multifaceted approach is crucial for effective grassroots planning and development.


**2. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1.  Funding for CSSs is solely routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report by a Chief Ministers' Sub-Group.
3.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes aligning with the National Development Agenda and Vision 2022.
4.  The funding pattern for core schemes is uniformly 60:40 (Centre:State) across all states.
5. NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

(a) 1, 4, and 5
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is false because while the majority of transfers are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State,  it's not exclusively so. Statements 4 and 5 are also incorrect. The funding pattern varies (90:10 for some states, 60:40 for others), and NITI Aayog does indeed play a role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations.  Statements 2 and 3 accurately reflect aspects of CSSs.  The sub-group report forms the basis of the current framework, and CSSs are designed to support national development goals. The incorrect statements highlight the complexities and variations within the CSS structure, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the scheme's operational details.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Capacity Building Commission (CBC) and Mission Karmayogi:**

1. The CBC was established as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB).
2.  Mission Karmayogi aims to create a civil service primarily focused on rule-based training.
3.  The NPCSCB encompasses all civil servants, including contractual employees.
4. A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from role-based to rule-based training.
5. Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles include a competency-driven approach to capacity development.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 5
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 correctly describe aspects of the CBC and Mission Karmayogi. The CBC is indeed part of the NPCSCB (1), the program includes all civil servants, including contractual staff (3), and a competency-driven approach is a key principle (5). Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a shift *from* rule-based *to* role-based training, highlighting a move towards competency-based development rather than rigid adherence to rules.  The contrasting nature of statements 2 and 4 with the correct options illustrates the need for careful understanding of the program's objectives and principles to avoid confusion.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment:**

1. Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
2. The Act was deemed to violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
3. Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts.
4.  The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act.
5. The state can freely contract with private corporations to share Aadhaar data.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are incorrect.  The Supreme Court's judgment mandated a limit on Aadhaar metadata storage (1), found the Act did *not* violate the mentioned fundamental rights (2), clarified that Aadhaar is *not* mandatory for bank accounts (3), and ruled against the state's unrestricted sharing of Aadhaar data with private entities (5). Only statement 4 is correct, reflecting the Supreme Court's affirmation of the Aadhaar Act's constitutionality. The inclusion of seemingly plausible but ultimately false statements emphasizes the importance of precise knowledge of the legal aspects of the Aadhaar system.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the continuation of the SCS.
4.  The granting of SCS is based on clearly defined, objective criteria outlined in the Constitution.
5.  Special packages are a discretionary alternative to SCS, providing additional financial assistance.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS (1); while the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used, it's not a constitutional provision (2); the 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS (3); there are no constitutionally defined criteria for SCS (4); and special packages are indeed discretionary alternatives, but not necessarily tied to objective criteria (5).  The fact that every statement is false highlights the need for a thorough understanding of the complexities surrounding the SCS and its replacement by special packages.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL is the first center of its kind in India.
2.  iCAL primarily focuses on auditing national-level governance bodies.
3.  iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
4.  iCAL's establishment enhances the independence of local government auditors.
5. The Ministry of Panchayati Raj developed the AuditOnline application.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. iCAL is indeed the first such center in India (1), aims to set global standards for local governance audits (3), enhances auditor independence (4), and the AuditOnline application was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (5). Statement 2 is incorrect; iCAL focuses specifically on local governance bodies, not national-level entities. The inclusion of a seemingly plausible but ultimately false statement underscores the importance of precise knowledge of iCAL's mandate and functions.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It applies uniformly to all states in India.
3.  It mandates specific forms of local governance structures.
4.  It aims to promote greater autonomy for tribal areas.
5. It was recently amended to include Ladakh.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 4 are correct.  The Sixth Schedule is based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations (1), and it aims to provide greater autonomy to tribal areas (4).  However, it does not apply uniformly to all states (2), doesn't mandate specific governance structures (3), and its recent inclusion of Ladakh is a matter of ongoing discussion and not yet a confirmed amendment (5).  The inclusion of several plausible but incorrect statements emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and application.


**8. Consider the following about the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. The DPBI is responsible for issuing passports to non-citizens.
2.  The DPBI's decisions are subject to appeal to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).
3. The DPBI's members serve a one-year term.
4.  The DPBI is empowered to impose penalties for non-compliance.
5.  Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of personal data.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The DPBI's decisions are appealable to TDSAT (2), it can impose penalties (4), and data principals have the right to data correction and erasure (5). Statement 1 is incorrect; passport issuance is not within the DPBI's purview.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; DPBI members serve two-year terms.  The presence of both correct and incorrect, yet plausible, statements emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of the DPBI's powers and functions.


**9. Consider the following statements related to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024:**

1. The rules provide for the venue-in-charge to file an FIR in cases of suspected unfair means.
2.  The rules apply only to examinations conducted by the Union Public Service Commission.
3.  The rules mandate the constitution of a committee for cases involving service providers.
4.  The rules were notified by the Ministry of Education.
5. The rules came into force in July 2024.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The rules do empower venue-in-charges to file FIRs (1), and they mandate committee formation in cases involving service providers (3). However, the rules are not limited to UPSC examinations (2); they were notified by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, not Education (4); and they came into force in June 2024, not July (5).  The mixture of correct and incorrect statements, all plausible in context, makes this a difficult question requiring precise knowledge of the rules.


**10. Consider the following regarding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders:**

1.  OCI cardholders are eligible to vote in Indian elections.
2.  Foreign military personnel are eligible for OCI cards.
3.  OCI cardholders have equal rights with NRIs regarding land acquisition.
4.  OCI cardholders can hold constitutional posts in India.
5. OCI cardholders are eligible for enrollment in the National Pension Scheme.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. OCI cardholders cannot vote (1), foreign military personnel are ineligible (2), they do not have equal land acquisition rights (3), and cannot hold constitutional posts (4). Only statement 5 is correct; OCI cardholders are eligible for the National Pension Scheme.  The high proportion of incorrect statements, all seemingly possible at first glance, emphasizes the necessity for precise understanding of OCI rights and restrictions.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
3.  The campaign involves structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas at all three tiers of Panchayats.
4. The thematic approach is based on the localization of SDGs, using the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.
5. Approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.
6.  The campaign exclusively focuses on the engagement of elected representatives and government frontline workers.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 accurately describe aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  The campaign's core objective is to enhance participatory planning at the grassroots level, involving communities in the creation of PDPs for 2025-26. Its launch date and the ministry responsible are correctly stated.  The use of structured meetings at various Panchayat levels and a thematic approach based on SDGs and the PDI are integral to its methodology. Finally, the publication of approved plans on the e-Gram Swaraj portal is a key feature. Statement 6 is incorrect; while elected representatives and government workers are involved, the campaign explicitly includes Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs) and other stakeholders, ensuring broader participation.  Therefore, four out of the six statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are funded jointly by the Centre and States and implemented through States.
2. The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
3. CSSs primarily focus on schemes included in the National Development Agenda for Vision 2022.
4.  Funding for CSSs is routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.
5.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolition of CSSs.
6. NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  CSSs are indeed joint ventures between the Centre and States, their current structure is rooted in the 2015 report, and they align with the national developmental goals. However, statement 4 is incorrect; funding is routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Union. Statement 5 is also false; the 14th Finance Commission didn't abolish CSSs but significantly altered their role in the context of the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction. Statement 6 is incorrect; NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following features of Aadhaar:**

1. It captures detailed personal information such as caste, religion, income, and health status.
2. Aadhaar serves as definitive proof of citizenship and domicile for Indian residents.
3. Aadhaar authentication can only be done offline at designated centers.
4.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016 mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government benefits and services.
5. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared Aadhaar unconstitutional.
6. Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 6 is correct. Aadhaar's design prioritizes minimizing the collection of sensitive personal data; it does not capture details like caste, religion, income, or health status (incorrect in statement 1).  It is not proof of citizenship or domicile (incorrect in statement 2). Aadhaar authentication is online and not limited to offline centers (incorrect in statement 3). The Aadhaar Act does not mandate Aadhaar for *all* government benefits, only for those funded from the Consolidated Fund of India or State (incorrect in statement 4). The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in 2018 (incorrect in statement 5).  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states.
3. It applies to all states in Northeast India.
4.  The Sixth Schedule grants special powers to the Governor to intervene in the affairs of the autonomous district councils.
5. The Sixth Schedule was introduced in 1950.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), establishes autonomous district councils in specific states (primarily in Northeast India) and grants the Governor certain powers of intervention. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it is based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee. Statement 3 is incorrect; it doesn't apply to *all* Northeast states. Statement 5 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule was included in the original Constitution of 1950. Only two statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. It retains the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
2. Spectrum allocation is solely through auctions.
3. The Act establishes a new regulatory body for Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.
4. The Digital Bharat Nidhi replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).
5. The Act provides for measures to protect users from unsolicited messages.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The Act introduces changes to spectrum allocation, with auctions as a primary method.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi is the successor to the USOF. The Act also incorporates provisions for user protection against unsolicited messages. However, statement 1 is false; the 2023 Act repeals the older Acts. Statement 3 is also false; the Act does not create a separate regulatory body specifically for OTT platforms. Therefore, four statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS):**

1. SCS is constitutionally mandated.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula determined grants for SCS states.
3. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations ended the SCS system.
4. SCS states receive additional funding under Article 282.
5.  The demand for SCS is based solely on geographical disadvantages.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the formal SCS classification, and additional funding for states facing challenges is often provided under Article 282. However, statement 1 is incorrect; SCS is not constitutionally mandated. Statement 2 is incorrect; although the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used at one point, it's not the sole or current mechanism. Statement 5 is incorrect; the demand is based on both geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme:**

1. CSC SPV was set up under the Information Technology Act, 2000.
2. CSCs are exclusively focused on delivering government services.
3. CSCs form one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
4.  The CSC scheme is primarily targeted towards urban populations.
5. CSCs offer services only in Hindi and English.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. CSCs are indeed one of the three pillars of the NeGP.  Statement 1 is incorrect; CSC SPV was established under the Companies Act, 1956. Statement 2 is incorrect; CSCs deliver both government and private sector services. Statement 4 is incorrect; the scheme targets rural populations. Statement 5 is incorrect; CSCs cater to the linguistic diversity of India.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**8.  Consider the following about Mission Karmayogi:**

1. It is solely focused on training government officers at the senior level.

5.  The primary objective is to improve the efficiency of government services.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 4 and 5 are correct. Mission Karmayogi includes all civil servants, including contractual employees, and aims to enhance efficiency.  Statement 1 is incorrect; it covers all levels of civil servants. Statement 2 is incorrect; it shifts from a rule-based to a role-based approach. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CBC is a key component of Mission Karmayogi. Therefore, four statements are correct.



**9. Consider the following regarding the President's power on Mercy Petitions:**

1. The President can only grant pardons for offences against Union laws.

3. The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and cannot be challenged.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute death sentences, and the President can reject a mercy petition without detailed reasons. The President's power also extends to court-martial cases. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the President's power extends beyond offences solely against Union laws. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not entirely unchallengeable in certain circumstances.  Three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements about Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

4. The objective of FTSCs is to ensure swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.
5.  All 1023 FTSCs planned have become operational.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at expediting rape and POCSO Act cases. However, statement 1 is incorrect; they are funded from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 2 is incorrect; while they handle POCSO cases, they also deal with other rape cases. Statement 5 is incorrect; not all planned courts are operational.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 accurately reflects the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Remember that these questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan):**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018 by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  The campaign uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.
4.  It mandates the publication of approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary aim of Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to increase public involvement in creating Panchayat Development Plans. Statement 3 is also correct; the PDI is a key tool used to identify areas needing improvement.  Statement 4 is accurate; the approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal for transparency and accessibility. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. While the campaign was indeed launched in 2018, it was initiated by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This subtle difference makes it a challenging question for UPSC aspirants who need to be precise in their knowledge.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the facts regarding the campaign's launch ministry, objectives, and implementation processes.


**2. Consider the following features of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, as per the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment:**

1.  Aadhaar metadata storage is restricted to a maximum of six months.
2.  The Act does not violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
3.  Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing all government services, including private sector services.
4.  The government is permitted to contract with private entities for Aadhaar data sharing.

Which of the above statements are NOT correct?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the Supreme Court's 2018 ruling on the Aadhaar Act.  The court did limit the storage of Aadhaar metadata and upheld the Act's constitutionality regarding the mentioned fundamental rights. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, the court clarified it cannot be forced for all government services or private sector engagements.  Similarly, statement 4 is incorrect; the court explicitly prohibited the government from contracting with private corporations for Aadhaar data sharing to protect citizens' right to privacy.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the Supreme Court's judgment and their ability to identify the incorrect statements among closely related, seemingly correct ones.


**3. Consider the following statements about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. CSSs are funded entirely by the central government.
2.  The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
3.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes included in the National Development Agenda.
4.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolition of CSSs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct. The current structure of CSS is based on the 2015 report, and they concentrate on the National Development Agenda. However, statement 1 is incorrect; CSSs are jointly funded by the center and states.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission did not abolish CSSs but significantly altered their funding and implementation.  The question tests the candidate's precise understanding of the role and evolution of CSSs within the Indian federal system, requiring them to discern subtle inaccuracies amidst plausible-sounding statements.


**4. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS):**

1. SCS is constitutionally mandated.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine SCS grants.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS.
4.  States receiving special funding are based on the 14th Finance Commission recommendations.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used, and the 14th Finance Commission did recommend ending SCS. However, statement 1 is incorrect; SCS isn't constitutionally mandated but a policy decision.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; current special funding patterns for Northeastern and Himalayan states are based on subsequent recommendations, not solely the 14th Finance Commission. The question challenges the candidate's knowledge of the historical context and evolution of SCS, demanding a nuanced understanding of its constitutional and financial aspects.


**5. Consider the following about the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. It is located in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
2. It aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3. It primarily focuses on auditing the accounts of the central government.
4. It acts as a knowledge center for addressing governance issues at the grassroots level.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. iCAL aims to set global standards and serves as a knowledge center for grassroots governance issues. However, statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat. Statement 3 is also incorrect; it focuses on local, not central, government auditing. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific details about iCAL while including plausible distractors regarding its location and scope of operations.


**6. Consider the following features of Mission Karmayogi:**

1. It focuses solely on training newly recruited civil servants.
2. It advocates for a shift from rule-based to role-based training.
3. It is implemented exclusively by the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions.
4.  It emphasizes a competency-driven approach to capacity development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 correctly describe Mission Karmayogi's focus on role-based training and a competency-driven approach. However, statement 1 is incorrect; it covers all civil servants, not just new recruits. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the Ministry of Personnel plays a key role, other ministries and agencies are involved in its implementation. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the core principles and implementation mechanisms of Mission Karmayogi, requiring them to distinguish between the program's actual features and potentially misleading assertions.


**7. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was implemented based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It primarily applies to the states of Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram.
3. It provides for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils.
4. It aims to promote the integration of tribal areas with the mainstream Indian society.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Sixth Schedule establishes Autonomous District Councils and aims to integrate tribal areas while respecting their autonomy.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; it was based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while it applies to several states, it's not limited to Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram alone. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's provisions and aims while providing plausible but inaccurate statements regarding its origins and geographic scope.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**


1.  It mandates prior permission to receive foreign funds.
2.  NGOs can use foreign contributions for any purpose.
3.  The validity of FCRA registration is for a period of two years.
4.  Annual returns are not mandatory for NGOs under FCRA.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The FCRA does require prior permission to receive foreign funds.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The use of funds is restricted, the registration validity is five years (not two), and annual returns are mandatory. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key provisions of the FCRA, including the restrictions on the use of foreign funds and the filing of annual returns.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in statements that might appear plausible at first glance.


These questions are designed to be challenging and require a thorough understanding of the concepts and facts.  They go beyond simple factual recall and test analytical and evaluative skills, which are crucial for success in the UPSC examination.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against any law relating to a matter where the executive power of the Union extends.
2. The President's power under Article 72 extends to death sentences imposed by court-martials.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
4. The President can reject a mercy petition even if the convict has exhausted all other legal remedies.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the punishment of any person convicted of any offense. This power extends to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  Crucially, it also includes the power to commute a death sentence. Therefore, statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Statement 4 is also correct; the President's decision is not automatically subject to judicial review, though the Supreme Court has entertained challenges in exceptional circumstances.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not directly subject to judicial review. While the Supreme Court may examine related constitutional issues or procedural irregularities, it cannot directly overturn the President's decision in this context.  The President's power in this regard is considered discretionary and is exercised independently.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in India:**

1. A curative petition is the last available constitutional remedy if a review petition under Article 137 has been rejected by the Supreme Court.
2. The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 142, which empowers the Court to do complete justice.
3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there's a demonstrable violation of the principles of natural justice during the original trial.
4. The Supreme Court has established a specific, codified procedure for filing and adjudicating curative petitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: A curative petition is indeed the final legal recourse available in the Indian judicial system after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court. Statement 2 is also accurate: The Supreme Court's authority to hear curative petitions is derived from its inherent powers under Article 142 to ensure complete justice.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while a violation of principles of natural justice is a valid ground, other grounds such as a judge's undisclosed conflict of interest or a demonstrably biased judgment can also justify a curative petition.  However, Statement 4 is incorrect. While guidelines exist for filing curative petitions, there isn't a formally codified procedure like there is for other legal processes. The Supreme Court handles these petitions on a case-by-case basis, making the process somewhat opaque and discretionary.


**3. Consider the following statements about Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme primarily focused on the expeditious disposal of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. The funding for FTSCs comes entirely from the Nirbhaya Fund.
3. FTSCs are established under the specific statutory backing of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC).
4. The establishment and functioning of FTSCs are monitored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While FTSCs handle other rape cases as well, their primary focus is indeed on swiftly resolving cases under the POCSO Act. Statement 2 is also correct; the Nirbhaya Fund is the main source of funding for this scheme.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. FTSCs don't have a specific statutory backing within the CrPC. They operate under the broader framework of the criminal justice system and rely on existing legal provisions to function. Statement 4 is also incorrect. The Department of Justice, under the Ministry of Law and Justice, is primarily responsible for the implementation and monitoring of FTSCs, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


**4. Consider the following statements about Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are exempt from application in all tribal areas in India.
2. These courts are deemed to be courts of a Judicial Magistrate of First Class.
3. They are mobile courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction to resolve petty disputes.
4. They are bound by the rules of evidence stipulated in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.


Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, they are not exempt from application in *all* tribal areas. The Act exempts specific tribal areas and certain states. Statement 2 is correct; Gram Nyayalayas are indeed deemed to be courts of a Judicial Magistrate of First Class. Statement 3 is also correct: They are designed to be mobile courts with jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters concerning petty disputes. Statement 4 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate under the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence.


**5. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:**

1. The definition of contempt of court is exclusively defined within the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2. Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish for contempt under Articles 129 and 215, respectively.
3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court.
4.  The power to punish for contempt is absolute and not subject to any limitations or safeguards.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a framework, the definition and parameters of contempt are also shaped by judicial pronouncements and interpretations. Statement 2 is correct: Articles 129 and 215 grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt. Statement 3 correctly differentiates between civil and criminal contempt.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The power to punish for contempt is not absolute.  There are limitations and safeguards to prevent its misuse, including the need to demonstrate clear intent and the potential for appeals against contempt orders.  The Supreme Court has also emphasized the need for a balanced approach to protect judicial authority while upholding fundamental rights.


**6. Consider the following regarding Special Category States (SCS):**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2. The grant of SCS to states was based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula before the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations resulted in the discontinuation of the SCS category.
4.  States currently receiving special financial assistance are doing so strictly based on their former SCS status.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly mention or define the category of "Special Category States."  Statement 2 is correct: The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used to determine grants to SCS before the 14th Finance Commission. Statement 3 is also correct: The 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of the SCS category, leading to its discontinuation. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While some states that were previously classified as SCS continue to receive special financial assistance, this assistance is not solely based on their former SCS status.  The current financial assistance is based on various factors, including the recommendations of subsequent Finance Commissions and other assessments of their specific needs.  The current special funding pattern to Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, not their former SCS status.


**7.  Consider the following regarding the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India:**

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and applies to all types of arbitrations in India.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards if the arbitration agreement or award was obtained through fraud or corruption.
3. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre (NDIAC) Act, 2019, facilitates institutional arbitration.
4. The Mediation Act, 2023, seeks to promote mediation as a preferred mode of ADR, encompassing pre-litigation mediation and online mediation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  Statement 1 accurately describes the basis and application of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Statement 2 correctly reflects the key provision of the 2021 amendment regarding fraud or corruption in arbitration proceedings. Statement 3 accurately describes the purpose of the NDIAC Act, 2019. Statement 4 accurately points out the objectives and scope of the Mediation Act, 2023, which aims to promote mediation as a preferred ADR method and includes various forms of mediation.  The Act provides a comprehensive legal framework for mediation in India.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. It grants special provisions for the administration of tribal areas in certain states.
3. It mandates the establishment of autonomous district councils with specific powers.
4. It applies uniformly to all tribal areas across India.


Which of the following statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, found under Article 244(2), was indeed influenced by the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. Statement 2 is also correct; it provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states with significant tribal populations. Statement 3 is also correct; it empowers these councils with legislative and administrative powers within their respective territories. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does not apply uniformly to all tribal areas. It specifically applies to certain tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Other tribal areas in India are governed by different provisions and mechanisms.


**9. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are primarily funded by the Union government, with states having a minimal contribution.
2. The funding pattern for CSSs varies depending on the specific scheme and the state's developmental needs.
3. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations played a significant role in shaping the current framework of CSSs.
4. NITI Aayog plays a role in monitoring and evaluating the performance of CSSs.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Union government is the primary funder, the contribution from states varies according to the scheme. Statement 2 is correct.  The funding pattern varies depending on the scheme and the state's developmental needs.  Statement 3 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations significantly impacted the structure and implementation of CSSs, particularly with the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction. Statement 4 is also correct. NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring and evaluating CSSs through various mechanisms and third-party evaluations.


**10. Consider the following statements about Mission Karmayogi:**

1. Mission Karmayogi aims to shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building for civil servants.
2. It primarily focuses on training only senior-level bureaucrats in the Union Government.
3. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is a key component of Mission Karmayogi.
4. Mission Karmayogi's training programs are exclusively delivered through traditional classroom methods.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mission Karmayogi aims to shift from a rule-based to a role-based capacity building system for civil servants. Statement 2 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various levels and ministries. Statement 3 is correct. The CBC is indeed an integral part of Mission Karmayogi, playing a crucial role in its implementation. Statement 4 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi employs a variety of training methods, not only traditional classroom-based instruction, but also online learning, blended learning, and other modern techniques.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Indian passports:**

1.  The Central government can exempt certain individuals from needing a passport.
2.  The Central government can issue passports to non-Indian citizens in the public interest.
3.  India issues only two types of passports: Ordinary (blue) and Diplomatic (white).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Indian Passport Act allows the Central government to grant exemptions from passport requirements in specific circumstances, and it also permits the issuance of passports to non-citizens if deemed necessary in the public interest. This reflects the government's discretionary power in matters of national security and international relations.  However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India issues three classes of passports: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon). The inclusion of the Official passport as a distinct category is crucial for differentiating the travel documents used by government officials on official business from those used by diplomats.  The omission of this category in statement 3 makes it factually inaccurate.


**2. Consider the following features of Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

1.  Established under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.
2.  A key component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), alongside connectivity and a national data bank.
3.  Primarily focused on providing services to urban citizens through a centralized framework.
4.  Offer only government-to-citizen (G2C) services.

How many of the above features accurately describe CSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. CSCs were indeed established by the Ministry of Electronics & IT and are a crucial part of the NeGP's three-pillar structure. However, statement 3 is incorrect. CSCs are primarily designed to deliver services to rural citizens, bridging the digital divide and extending government services to remote areas. Statement 4 is also incorrect. While CSCs offer G2C services, they also provide a range of B2C (business-to-consumer) services and financial services, making them a multi-faceted delivery platform.  The inaccurate portrayal of CSC's target audience and service scope in statements 3 and 4 renders them incorrect.


**3. Consider the following aspects of the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024:**

1.  Published annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading international NGO.
2.  Released on World Press Freedom Day (May 3rd).
3.  India ranked higher than Norway in the 2024 index.
4.  Based solely on political indicators affecting press freedom.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the WPFI 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The WPFI is indeed published annually by RSF on World Press Freedom Day. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's ranking in the 2024 index was significantly lower than Norway's, reflecting the challenges to press freedom in India.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate. The WPFI considers multiple indicators, including political, economic, legislative, social, and security factors, not solely political ones. This multi-faceted approach provides a comprehensive assessment of press freedom, rather than solely focusing on the political environment.  The incorrect ranking and limited scope presented in statements 3 and 4 make them factually inaccurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1.  Established in 1963 based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee.
2.  A constitutional body with statutory powers.
3.  Headed by a Director selected by a panel including the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Chief Justice of India.
4.  Its mandate exclusively involves investigating cases related to corruption within the government.

How many of the statements above are correct about the CBI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The CBI was established in 1963 following the Santhanam Committee's recommendations, and its Director's selection involves the mentioned panel. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The CBI is a non-statutory body, operating under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. It is not a constitutional body, which distinguishes it from institutions directly established by the Constitution.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. While corruption is a significant part of its mandate, the CBI's investigative scope extends to various other economic and violent crimes, including those involving high technology and cybercrime. The incorrect characterization of the CBI's legal status and investigative scope in statements 2 and 4 makes them inaccurate.


**5. Consider the following elements related to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is one of the designated nodal agencies.
2.  CPGRAMS is an offline platform for lodging grievances.
3.  District Magistrates are always designated as District Public Grievance Officers.
4.  The Sevottam model only focuses on grievance redressal.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of GRM in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. DARPG is indeed a key nodal agency for handling grievances at the Union government level.  Statement 2 is incorrect; CPGRAMS is an online platform, not offline.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While District Magistrates often serve as District Public Grievance Officers, this isn't universally true across all states.  Statement 4 is incorrect as well; the Sevottam model encompasses citizen charters and capacity building for service delivery, in addition to grievance redressal.  The inaccuracies in statements 2, 3, and 4 regarding the nature of CPGRAMS, the role of District Magistrates, and the scope of the Sevottam model render these statements incorrect.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Assam's Co-Districts Initiative:**

1.  It replaces the existing system of civil sub-divisions.
2.  Co-districts are headed by officers of the rank of Deputy District Commissioner.
3.  The initiative primarily aims to centralize administration.
4.  It is the first such initiative in India aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Co-Districts Initiative in Assam?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The Co-Districts Initiative in Assam does indeed replace the existing system of civil sub-divisions with smaller administrative units. Statement 2 is incorrect. Co-districts are headed by officers of the rank of Assistant District Commissioner, not Deputy District Commissioner. Statement 3 is incorrect; the initiative aims to decentralize administration, bringing services closer to the people. Statement 4 is also incorrect; this statement describes a different initiative altogether, not the Co-Districts Initiative.  The incorrect ranks, objectives, and conflation with other initiatives in statements 2, 3, and 4 render them factually inaccurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1.  It is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI).
2.  Its applicability extends only to political parties and their candidates.
3.  Violation of the MCC leads to direct prosecution under criminal law.
4.  The MCC is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the MCC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The MCC is indeed a set of guidelines laid down by the ECI. Statement 2 is incorrect; the MCC applies to various actors, including the government in power and government employees. Statement 3 is incorrect; violations of the MCC are not directly prosecuted under criminal law, though they might be addressed through other existing statutes.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the MCC is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, although its authority derives from the ECI's constitutional powers under Article 324.  The incorrect scope of applicability, legal consequences, and constitutional status in statements 2, 3, and 4 render them incorrect.


**8. Consider the following aspects of Lok Sabha elections:**

1.  Members are elected through a system of proportional representation.
2.  Each constituency elects multiple representatives.
3.  The election system is based on territorial representation.
4.  A candidate winning a plurality of votes is declared elected.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the system of Lok Sabha elections?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Lok Sabha elections are indeed based on territorial representation, with each constituency electing a single representative. Statement 1 is incorrect; Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of first-past-the-post, not proportional representation. Statement 2 is incorrect; each constituency elects only one representative (single-member constituency). Statement 4 is also incorrect; a candidate winning a majority of votes (not simply a plurality) is declared elected.  The incorrect representation of election systems and vote requirements in statements 1, 2, and 4 makes them inaccurate.


**9. Consider the following provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023:**

1.  It replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
2.  It mandates forensic investigation for all offenses.
3.  It provides for the release of first-time offenders on bail after completing one-third of the maximum sentence.
4.  It does not address offenses related to food adulteration.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, not the Indian Penal Code, 1860.  It also provides for the release of first-time offenders on bail after serving one-third of their maximum sentence.  Statement 2 is incorrect; forensic investigation is mandatory only for offenses with a minimum sentence of seven years.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the provided text doesn't specifically mention food adulteration, it's highly likely that such offenses would fall under its purview.  The incorrect scope of replacement, forensic investigation, and omission of certain offenses in statements 2 and 4 render them inaccurate.


**10. Consider the following about the distribution of tax revenue in India:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution among states from the share allocated to them.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states under Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the distribution of tax revenue in India?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 2 are correct. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending the distribution of Union-levied and collected taxes. Grants-in-aid are indeed provided under Article 275.  Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool given to the states. However, statement 4 is incorrect. State governments can borrow only within India, not outside, without the prior consent of the Union Government.  The incorrect description of state borrowing powers in statement 4 renders it inaccurate.

1.  It is granted to states facing socio-economic and geographical disadvantages.
2.  It was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
3.  The criteria for granting SCS are explicitly defined in the Constitution.
4.  All states currently receiving SCS are located in the North-Eastern region of India.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the SCS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. SCS is granted to states facing disadvantages, and it was first introduced in 1969 based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the criteria for granting SCS are not constitutionally defined.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while several states currently receiving SCS are in the North-East, this is not universally true. The incorrect constitutional basis and regional limitation in statements 3 and 4 render them inaccurate.


**12. Consider the following about the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF):**

1.  It is an absolute right recognized in Indian jurisprudence.
2.  The Supreme Court of India recognized RTBF as part of the right to life under Article 21.
3.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 explicitly includes the RTBF.
4.  The concept of RTBF originated in French jurisprudence.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the RTBF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Supreme Court did recognize RTBF as a part of Article 21, and its origins trace back to French jurisprudence. However, statement 1 is incorrect; RTBF is not an absolute right.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does not explicitly mention RTBF. The incorrect characterization of RTBF as absolute and its inclusion in the 2023 Act render statements 1 and 3 inaccurate.


**13. Consider the following regarding the Inner Line Permit (ILP):**

1.  It allows unrestricted travel to all Indian citizens within protected areas.
2.  It is primarily used to regulate movement near international borders.
3.  It is applicable to all states in the North-Eastern region of India.
4.  NRIs are eligible to apply for an ILP.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the ILP system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The ILP system is indeed used to regulate movement near India's international borders. Statement 1 is incorrect; ILP grants limited-period travel permits, not unrestricted access. Statement 3 is incorrect; ILP is not applicable to all North-Eastern states. Statement 4 is incorrect; NRIs are not eligible for ILP and must apply for a different permit.  The incorrect descriptions of access, regional application, and eligibility in statements 1, 3, and 4 render them inaccurate.


**14. Consider the following about the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges:**

1.  It consists of members elected through proportional representation.
2.  It investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges.
3.  Its members are nominated by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
4.  It is responsible for reviewing the progress of Hindi for official purposes.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges does investigate breaches of parliamentary privileges. Statement 1 is incorrect; Rajya Sabha members are elected, but the committee's composition does not involve proportional representation. Statement 3 is incorrect; the committee's members are nominated by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. Statement 4 is incorrect; that function belongs to a different parliamentary committee. The incorrect modes of member selection and functional responsibilities in statements 1, 3, and 4 render them inaccurate.


**15. Consider the following regarding Union Cabinet Committees:**

1.  They are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2.  They are chaired exclusively by Cabinet Ministers.
3.  Their establishment is provided for in the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.
4.  Non-Cabinet Ministers are barred from their membership.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Union Cabinet Committees?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The establishment of Cabinet Committees is indeed provided for in the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961. Statement 1 is incorrect; they are extra-constitutional. Statement 2 is incorrect; while many are chaired by Cabinet Ministers, this is not a universal rule. Statement 4 is also incorrect; non-Cabinet Ministers are not barred from membership.  The incorrect constitutional status, chairmanship requirements, and membership restrictions in statements 1, 2, and 4 render them inaccurate.



**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The issuance of a passport to a non-citizen of India is permissible under certain circumstances.
2.  There are three classes of passports issued in India: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon).
3.  The Central Government can exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement.
4.  The Passport Act of India mandates passport possession for international travel by Indian citizens.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions related to passport issuance in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe aspects of passport issuance in India.  The government does have the authority to issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest, as this can be vital for international relations or humanitarian reasons. The three passport classes (Ordinary, Diplomatic, and Official) represent different levels of access and diplomatic standing.  The government also retains the power to grant exemptions from passport requirements in specific cases, which could be for reasons of national security, humanitarian crises, or other exceptional circumstances. Statement 4, while generally true for the purposes of international travel by Indian Citizens, is an oversimplification. The reality is more nuanced and subject to exceptions as detailed in the other correct statements. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the complete picture.


**2. Consider the following statements about the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme:**

1.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established under the Indian Contract Act of 1872.
2.  CSCs primarily serve urban populations in India.
3.  The CSC scheme is a component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
4.  CSCs offer services only from the government sector.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the CSC scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. The CSC SPV was established under the Companies Act, 1956, not the Indian Contract Act of 1872.  CSCs are designed to reach rural citizens, not primarily urban populations.  The CSC scheme is indeed a crucial part of the NeGP, aiming to bridge the digital divide and improve access to government services in rural India.  Finally, CSCs offer services from the government, private, and social sectors, not just the government sector alone.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024:**

1.  The WPFI is published by the United Nations.
2.  India ranked higher than 160 in the WPFI 2024.
3.  The WPFI assesses press freedom based solely on political factors.
4.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF) publishes the WPFI.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the WPFI 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The WPFI is not published by the United Nations, but by Reporters Without Borders (RSF). India's ranking was 159, which is below 160. The WPFI uses multiple indicators, including political, economic, legislative, social, and security factors, not just political factors.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole nodal agency for handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  CPGRAMS is a 24/7 online platform for citizens to lodge grievances.
3.  The District Magistrate always serves as the District Public Grievance Officer at the district level.
4.  The Sevottam model focuses solely on grievance redressal.


How many of the above statements are correct concerning GRM in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  There are two designated nodal agencies at the Union Government level, not just DARPG; the Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat also plays a crucial role. CPGRAMS is indeed a 24/7 online platform for lodging grievances.  While District Magistrates often serve as District Public Grievance Officers, this isn't universally true across all states.  The Sevottam model encompasses Citizen's Charters, GRM, and capability building for service delivery, not solely grievance redressal.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following about the devolution of resources between the Union and States in India:**

1.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among different states.
2.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 50% share of the divisible pool for states.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states based on Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.


How many of the statements above accurately describe the devolution of resources in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. Vertical devolution is the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes collected by the Union Government, while horizontal devolution is the distribution among states from that share.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share, not 50%. Grants-in-aid are indeed based on Article 275. However, state governments can only borrow within India, not outside, as per Article 293. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  SCS is granted to states based solely on their geographical location.
2.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1979.
3.  Jammu & Kashmir was among the first states to be granted SCS.
4.  The Finance Commission recommends the granting of SCS.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Special Category Status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. SCS considers both geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, not just geographical location.  The concept was introduced in 1969, not 1979, based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission. Jammu & Kashmir was indeed one of the first recipients of SCS.  The Finance Commission plays a role in recommending the allocation of resources to special category states, but it doesn't grant the status itself. The decision to grant SCS rests with the Union Government. Therefore, only one statement is entirely accurate.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1.  The RTI Act came into force in June 2005.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the implementation of the RTI Act.
3.  The RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
4.  The Supreme Court has declared RTI a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect key aspects of the RTI Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The RTI Act came into force in October 2005, not June. The Department of Personnel and Training (under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions) does coordinate the Act's implementation. The RTI Act did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.  However, the Supreme Court established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19, not Article 21. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1.  CSSs are primarily funded by the state governments.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2010 report.
3.  CSSs focus on schemes that are part of the National Development Agenda.
4.  NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.


How many of the above statements are correct concerning Centrally Sponsored Schemes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. CSSs are primarily funded by the central government, not state governments. The current framework is based on a 2015 report, not a 2010 report.  CSSs do indeed focus on schemes within the National Development Agenda. NITI Aayog does have a role in monitoring CSSs, along with having concurrent jurisdiction. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following statements about Mission Karmayogi:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi aims to create a civil service solely focused on administrative tasks.
2.  Mission Karmayogi's training programs are exclusively for permanent civil servants.
3.  Mission Karmayogi promotes a shift from rule-based to role-based training.
4.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is not associated with Mission Karmayogi.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the goals and features of Mission Karmayogi?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Mission Karmayogi aims for a broader, more developmentally focused civil service, not limited to administrative tasks.  It covers all civil servants, including contractual employees.  It does indeed promote a shift from rule-based to role-based training.  The CBC is integral to Mission Karmayogi's implementation.  Therefore, only one statement is entirely accurate.


**10. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1.  Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2019.
2.  The campaign focuses solely on the preparation of District Panchayat Development Plans.
3.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to identify thematic developmental gaps.
4.  The campaign excludes the participation of youth and elderly people.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018, not 2019. It involves the preparation of plans at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram Panchayat, Block Panchayat, and District Panchayat). The PDI is used to identify gaps.  The campaign actively encourages the participation of youth and the elderly, not excluding them. Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**11. Consider the following regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL is the second such centre in India.
2.  iCAL's primary goal is to reduce the independence of local government auditors.
3.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
4.  iCAL is solely focused on auditing the financial aspects of local governance.

How many of the above statements are correct about iCAL?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. iCAL is the first such centre in India, not the second. It aims to enhance, not reduce, the independence of local government auditors.  It does aim to set global standards. While financial performance is a key aspect, iCAL's scope extends beyond just finance; it considers service delivery and overall governance. Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**12. Consider the following about the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1.  The CBI is a constitutional body.
2.  The CBI Director's tenure is fixed for five years.
3.  The CBI is primarily responsible for investigating cases related to human rights violations.
4.  The selection panel for the CBI Director includes the Chief Justice of India.


How many of the statements above correctly describe the CBI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body.  The CBI Director's tenure can be extended up to five years, but it's not fixed at five years.  While the CBI investigates various crimes, its primary focus isn't human rights violations; other agencies specialize in that area.  The selection panel for the CBI Director does indeed include the Chief Justice of India. Therefore, only one statement is fully correct.


**13. Consider the following regarding the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The FCRA is implemented by the Ministry of Finance.
2.  NGOs are not required to submit Aadhaar details under the FCRA.
3.  The FCRA mandates a designated FCRA account in a specified bank.
4.  NGOs can use up to 50% of foreign funds for administrative expenses.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the FCRA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The FCRA is implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), not the Ministry of Finance.  Aadhaar submission for office-bearers is mandatory.  The FCRA does indeed require a designated FCRA account in a specified bank branch.  NGOs can use a maximum of 20%, not 50%, of foreign funds for administrative expenses. Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**14. Consider the following about the Post Office Act, 2023:**

1.  The Post Office Act, 2023, amended the India Post Office Act, 1998.
2.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) is appointed to head India Post.
3.  The Act does not grant the DGPS the power to make regulations on postal charges.
4.  The Post Office Act, 2023, introduced a new postal code system for India.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the provisions of the Post Office Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. The Post Office Act, 2023, repealed, not amended, the 1998 Act. The DGPS is appointed to head India Post, and the Act does grant the DGPS the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps. The Act did not introduce a new postal code system.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on Polity and Governance, with detailed explanations:

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. iCAL is indeed the first such center in India, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance.  Statement 2 is also correct; iCAL is designed as a collaborative platform for capacity building.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While iCAL aims to improve financial performance assessment, its focus is on enhancing the *independence* of auditors, not necessarily their financial autonomy.  Statement 4 is partially incorrect.  While iCAL acts as a knowledge center and think tank, its focus is on addressing governance issues at the grassroots level, not solely national-level challenges. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) accurately describe iCAL.

1. It was developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to facilitate online auditing of panchayat accounts.
2.  It aims to enhance accountability in the utilization of funds at the grassroots level.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Statement 2 is correct; the application's core aim is to improve accountability in fund utilization. Statement 3 is correct;  AuditOnline did receive the award from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized agency of the UN. Statement 4 is incorrect. While it audits local bodies, its primary focus is on Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), not Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a group of Chief Ministers.
2. CSSs primarily focus on schemes related to the National Development Agenda.

4. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations played a crucial role in shaping the current CSS structure.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of CSSs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the current CSS framework is indeed based on the 2015 Sub-Group of Chief Ministers report. Statement 2 is also correct; CSSs align with the National Development Agenda. Statement 3 is incorrect.  All transfers for CSSs are routed *through* the Consolidated Fund of the State, not directly to the states.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Mission Karmayogi aims to modernize and improve the civil service. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, not just senior officials. Statement 3 is correct; a shift towards role-based training is a key principle. Statement 4 is correct; the CBC plays a significant role in the implementation of Mission Karmayogi.  Therefore, three statements (1, 3, and 4) accurately describe Mission Karmayogi.


**5. Consider the following about the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan):**

1. It aims to accelerate citizen participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans.
2. The campaign was launched in 2023 as part of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj’s initiatives.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; citizen participation is central to the campaign's goals. Statement 2 is incorrect; the campaign was initially rolled out in 2018, not 2023.  Statement 3 is correct; structured meetings at various levels are key components. Statement 4 is also correct; the PDI is used to guide the identification of developmental needs.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.

1. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.
2. The CAG directly conducts the audits of all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
3.  Examiners of Local Fund Accounts (ELFAs) or Directors of Local Fund Accounts (DLFAs) operate under the technical guidance of the CAG.
4. The CAG’s audit primarily focuses on centrally funded projects undertaken by local bodies.

Which of the above statements accurately depict the CAG's role?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the 1971 Act provides the legal basis for the CAG's role. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG exercises control and supervision but doesn't directly conduct all audits; it's often done through ELFAs/DLFAs. Statement 3 is correct; ELFAs/DLFAs work under the CAG's guidance. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CAG's audit covers all funds granted to local bodies, not just centrally funded projects.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**7. Consider the following statements related to the devolution of funds between the Union and States:**

1. Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among different states.
2. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations determined the criteria and weights for horizontal devolution.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided by the states to the Union government as per Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  Article 293 of the Constitution outlines the borrowing powers of both the Union and State governments.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes collected by the Union, not distribution among states. Statement 2 is correct; the 15th Finance Commission laid out the criteria for horizontal devolution. Statement 3 is incorrect. Grants-in-aid are provided by the *Union* government to the *states*, not vice-versa. Statement 4 is partially correct. Article 293 deals with state borrowing powers within India; however, the statement is misleading as it doesn't accurately reflect the complete details of Article 292 and 293. Therefore, only statement 2 is completely correct, and statement 4 is partially correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Parliamentary Committees:**

1. Parliamentary Committees are appointed solely by the Lok Sabha Speaker.
2.  The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India.
3. The Estimates Committee's primary function is to examine the efficiency of government administration.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lok Sabha Speaker plays a significant role, committees can be appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker. Statement 2 is correct; this is a key function of the Public Accounts Committee. Statement 3 is correct; the Estimates Committee examines administrative efficiency and resource allocation. Statement 4 is correct; the PCOL was indeed established under the 1963 Act. Therefore, only statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.

(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional body, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Statement 2 is correct; the President appoints the Chairperson and members based on a committee's recommendation. Statement 3 is correct; the NHRC possesses significant powers for investigation and evidence gathering. Statement 4 is also correct;  protecting marginalized groups is implicitly and explicitly part of the NHRC's mandate.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.

2. The CBI's jurisdiction extends to investigating cases only within the states that have given their consent.
3. The Director of the CBI is appointed by the President of India.
4. The CBI is primarily responsible for investigating cases related to corruption and other serious crimes.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding the CBI?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBI is a statutory body, not a constitutional one.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While states' consent is often sought, the CBI's jurisdiction extends to matters of national importance even without specific state consent. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the President plays a role, the appointment process is more complex and involves consultation with other entities. Statement 4 is correct; the CBI deals with serious crimes, including corruption. Therefore, only statement 4 is completely correct.  Statement 3 is partially correct depending on the interpretation of the "appointment process".




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. It repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
2. It introduces a new framework for Right of Way (RoW) granting.
3.  It mandates the regulation of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms under its provisions.
4. It establishes a new fund named Digital Bharat Nidhi.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, aims to modernize India's telecommunications framework. Statement 1 is correct: The Act repeals the outdated 1885 and 1933 Acts to accommodate technological advancements. Statement 2 is also correct: It establishes a non-discriminatory RoW framework to facilitate infrastructure development. Statement 4 is correct as well:  The Universal Service Obligation Fund is renamed Digital Bharat Nidhi under the Act's control. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act explicitly states that OTT platforms will *not* be regulated under its provisions, indicating a separate regulatory approach for these digital services.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's judgment in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India and Ors.* (2020):**

1. The Court declared internet shutdowns to be unconstitutional.
2. The Court upheld the government's power to temporarily suspend telecom services.
3. The Court ruled that freedom of speech and expression through the internet is a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a).
4. The Court mandated a specific timeframe for the review of internet shutdown orders.


Which of the above statements accurately reflects the Supreme Court's ruling?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The *Anuradha Bhasin* case was a landmark judgment on internet shutdowns. Statement 1 is incorrect: The Court did not declare internet shutdowns entirely unconstitutional but emphasized that indefinite shutdowns are impermissible. Statement 2 is correct: The Court acknowledged the government's power to temporarily suspend services under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017,  but with strict limitations. Statement 3 is also correct: The Court explicitly recognized internet freedom as an integral part of Article 19(1)(a). Statement 4 is incorrect: While the Court emphasized the need for timely review, it did not prescribe a specific timeframe within the judgment. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 accurately represent the core elements of the Supreme Court's decision.



**3. Consider the following features of the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024:**

1.  It defines "unfair means" to include unauthorized access to question papers.
2.  It prescribes imprisonment for those resorting to unfair means but not for service providers involved in organized crime related to examinations.
3.  All offenses under the Act are cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable.
4.  It mandates periodic reporting of unfair means incidents by regional officers to the public examination authority.

How many of the above features are correctly described in the Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Public Examination Act aims to curb unfair practices in public examinations. Statement 1 is correct: The Act explicitly defines various actions, including unauthorized access to question papers, as "unfair means." Statement 3 is also correct: The Act designates all offenses as cognizable, non-bailable, and non-compoundable, reflecting its seriousness. Statement 4 is correct;  the act mandates reporting by regional officers.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Act *does* prescribe penalties, including fines, for service providers or individuals involved in organized crime related to examinations,  not just for candidates. Therefore, only three of the stated features are accurately described.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023:**

1. It introduces the concept of "Zero FIR."
2. It repeals the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
3. It streamlines the process of registering First Information Reports (FIRs).
4. It mandates the establishment of fast-track courts for specific offenses.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect provisions within the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, is a significant piece of legislation. Statement 1 is correct:  The Act incorporates the provision for Zero FIRs, allowing registration irrespective of the location of the crime. Statement 3 is also correct; it aims to streamline FIR registration processes.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; it does not repeal the IPC completely. While it introduces changes and reforms, it doesn't entirely replace the older code. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the act doesn't specifically mandate the establishment of fast-track courts.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the provisions of the Sanhita.



**5. Consider the following regarding the Doctrine of Coverture:**

1. It is a legal doctrine originating in English common law.
2. It treats a married woman and her husband as a single legal entity.
3. It was explicitly upheld by the Supreme Court of India in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018).
4. It grants married women complete legal autonomy.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Doctrine of Coverture?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Doctrine of Coverture is a historical legal concept. Statement 1 is correct:  It originated in English common law. Statement 2 is also correct: The doctrine considered the husband and wife as a single legal entity, subordinating the wife's legal existence to her husband's.  Statement 3 is incorrect: In *Joseph Shine v. Union of India*, the Supreme Court *rejected* the Doctrine of Coverture as the basis for the Marital Rape Exception. Statement 4 is incorrect: The doctrine did *not* grant married women legal autonomy; rather, it significantly restricted their rights. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the Doctrine of Coverture.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Anti-Defection Law:**

1. It was introduced through the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985.
2. It allows for the merger of a political party without any conditions.
3.  The presiding officer of the House decides on disqualification cases.
4. It provides for a specific timeframe for the presiding officer to decide on anti-defection cases.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the Anti-Defection Law?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Anti-Defection Law aims to curb political defections. Statement 1 is correct: It was added to the Constitution through the 10th Schedule via the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985. Statement 3 is also correct: The presiding officer of the respective House (Lok Sabha or State Assembly) decides on disqualification matters. However, statement 2 is incorrect: The law allows mergers only if two-thirds of the legislators of the merging party agree.  Statement 4 is incorrect: The law currently lacks a prescribed timeframe for the presiding officer's decision. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1.  It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates its implementation.
3.  It defines Public Authorities (PAs) as only government bodies.
4.  The Supreme Court established RTI as a fundamental right in the *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* case.

How many of the statements accurately reflect aspects of the RTI Act, 2005?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The RTI Act is crucial for transparency and accountability. Statement 1 is correct: The 2005 Act replaced the earlier Freedom of Information Act. Statement 2 is also correct: The Department of Personnel and Training plays a key role in coordinating the Act's implementation.  Statement 4 is partially correct: The *Raj Narayan* case significantly contributed to the recognition of the importance of access to information, but it did not explicitly declare RTI a fundamental right in itself.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the Act's definition of Public Authorities is broader than just government bodies, including various other entities that hold public information. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately describe the RTI Act.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:**

1. It provides a path to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants from specific countries and religious backgrounds.
2. It reduces the naturalization period for eligible migrants.
3. It grants automatic Indian citizenship to all migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.
4. It cancels OCI registration only on grounds specified under the Act.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the CAA, 2019?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CAA is a controversial piece of legislation. Statement 1 is correct: The Act provides a pathway to citizenship for illegal migrants who meet certain criteria, including religious affiliation and origin from specified countries. Statement 2 is also correct: It reduces the naturalization period for eligible migrants.  Statement 4 is correct: The act does specify the grounds for cancellation of OCI registration.  However, statement 3 is incorrect: The CAA does not grant automatic citizenship to *all* migrants from the mentioned countries; it sets specific conditions for eligibility.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of the CAA.


**9. Consider the following about the  Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They are funded primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund.
2. Their primary objective is the swift disposal of rape cases and POCSO Act cases.
3. They are exclusively state-funded initiatives.
4. They are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the FTSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

FTSCs are designed to expedite justice in specific types of cases. Statement 1 is correct: A significant portion of their funding comes from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 2 is also correct: Their main purpose is the speedy resolution of rape and POCSO cases. Statement 4 is correct: The FTSCs are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid for efficient data management.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, indicating joint funding and implementation between the central and state governments.  Therefore, only three statements accurately represent the FTSCs.


**10. Consider the following regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1. It is a constitutional body.
2. It investigates complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3. It has the power to issue directions to the government.
4. It is solely responsible for the welfare of Scheduled Castes across all sectors.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the functions and powers of the NCSC?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NCSC is a crucial institution for protecting the rights of Scheduled Castes. Statement 1 is correct: It is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution. Statement 2 is also correct: A major function is investigating complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes. Statement 3 is correct:  The commission has the power to issue directions to both central and state governments. However, statement 4 is incorrect: While the NCSC plays a major role, it doesn't hold *sole* responsibility for the welfare of Scheduled Castes; other bodies and government departments also contribute to this.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992.
2.  The AuditOnline application developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2020.
3.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)'s (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.
4.  The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA).
5. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL).


How many of the above are directly related to the auditing mechanisms of local bodies in India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five elements are directly linked to the auditing mechanisms of local bodies in India.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 form the foundational legal framework for local self-governance, providing the basis for the auditing process. The AuditOnline application is a specific tool used for online auditing of panchayat accounts, enhancing accountability. The CAG's Act, 1971, defines the CAG's mandate and oversight role in auditing local bodies.  ELFAs/DLFAs are the implementing agencies that conduct audits at the state level under the CAG's supervision. Finally, the iCAL is a recently established institution aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance. Therefore, all five elements are integral parts of the system.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan).
2.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI).
3.  The e-Gram Swaraj portal.
4.  The Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas initiative.
5.  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj.


How many of the above are directly involved in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs)?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Four of the listed elements are directly involved in PDP preparation. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is the campaign itself aimed at accelerating people's participation in PDP creation. The PDI is used to identify thematic developmental gaps, informing the planning process. The e-Gram Swaraj portal serves as the platform for publishing the approved GPDPs.  The Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas initiative was the earlier name of the campaign, indicating its continuity.  While the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is the overarching authority, its role is more of an oversight and implementation body rather than a direct participant in the grassroots planning itself.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) plays a crucial role.
2.  The CPGRAMS portal is a key online platform for lodging grievances.
3.  Timelines for grievance redressal are mandated by law and cannot be changed.
4.  The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) ranks Ministries/Departments.
5.  The Cabinet Secretariat's Directorate of Public Grievances handles grievances.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the GRM in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four statements accurately describe the GRM. DARPG is a nodal agency, and CPGRAMS is a crucial online platform.  GRAI is used for ranking, and the Cabinet Secretariat's Directorate also handles grievances. However, statement 3 is incorrect. Timelines for grievance redressal, while aimed for efficiency, are subject to change and adjustments based on evolving needs and government directives; they are not fixed by immutable law.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1.  It was first introduced in Kerala during State Assembly elections.
2.  The Election Commission of India (ECI) lays down the guidelines.
3.  It aims to ensure free and fair elections.
4.  It is legally binding and enforceable in courts.
5.  It governs the conduct of political parties and candidates.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the MCC?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Three statements are accurate. The MCC originated in Kerala, is set by the ECI, and aims for free and fair elections. It also governs the conduct of political parties and candidates.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the MCC is a set of guidelines, not a legally binding statute enforceable through courts. While violations can lead to action by the ECI, it lacks the formal legal weight of a law.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023.
2.  The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.
3.  The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
4.  The Digital Bharat Nidhi.
5.  Right of Way (RoW) framework.


How many of the above are directly related to the regulation of the telecommunications sector in India?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four of these are directly related to telecommunications regulation. The 2023 Act is the current legislation. The 1885 and 1933 Acts are superseded by the newer legislation. The Digital Bharat Nidhi is a fund established under the new Act. The RoW framework is a crucial element for infrastructure development within the sector.  


**6. Consider the following concerning Lok Adalats:**

1. They are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987.
2.  Their decisions are final and binding, with no appeal possible.
3.  They are bound by the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC), 1908.
4.  They can handle cases pending in courts or disputes yet to be filed.
5.  The first Lok Adalat was held in Gujarat.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Lok Adalats?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Four statements are correct. Lok Adalats are established under the 1987 Act, their decisions are final, they can handle pending or pre-filing disputes, and the first one was indeed in Gujarat.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Lok Adalats are *not* bound by the CPC, 1908, which is a key aspect of their alternative dispute resolution nature.


**7. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1.  They are funded jointly by the Centre and States.
2.  They are implemented primarily through State governments.
3.  They cover sectors listed only in the Union List of the Constitution.
4.  The NITI Aayog is involved in their review and revamp.
5.  They are based on a report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.


How many of the above statements correctly describe CSSs?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four statements are accurate. CSSs are jointly funded, implemented through States, are reviewed by NITI Aayog and based on the Chief Ministers' report. Statement 3 is incorrect; CSSs cover sectors in both State and Concurrent Lists, not solely the Union List.


**8. Consider the following related to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) implements the FCRA.
2.  NGOs need prior permission to receive foreign funds.
3.  Foreign funds can be used for any purpose, as deemed fit by the recipient NGO.
4.  The FCRA registration has a validity of five years.
5.  The Intelligence Bureau assists the MHA in FCRA matters.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the FCRA?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four statements are correct. The MHA implements the FCRA with IB assistance, NGOs need prior permission, registration validity is five years.  Statement 3 is incorrect;  the FCRA strictly limits the use of foreign funds to the specified purpose, with restrictions on administrative expenses.


**9. Consider the following elements related to Aadhaar:**

1.  It uses a random number system for identification.
2.  It serves as proof of citizenship and domicile.
3.  Its data is stored centrally.
4.  It facilitates electronic benefit transfers.
5.  It is mandatory for all services and transactions in India.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Aadhaar system?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Three statements are correct. Aadhaar uses a random number, stores data centrally, and facilitates benefit transfers.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Aadhaar is proof of address and identity, not citizenship or domicile.  Statement 5 is incorrect; while Aadhaar is used for many government services, it's not mandatory for all services and transactions. The Supreme Court has upheld the right of individuals to choose whether to use Aadhaar.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  It is granted by the Centre to states facing disadvantages.
2.  It was first introduced on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
3.  States receiving SCS automatically receive higher allocations regardless of performance.
4.  Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded SCS.
5.  It provides financial assistance and other benefits to qualifying states.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Special Category Status?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Four statements are correct. SCS is granted to states facing disadvantages, it was first introduced based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded it, and it provides various benefits.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while SCS provides advantages, the allocation of funds still considers various factors, including the performance and needs of the specific state.  The SCS provides a framework for preferential treatment but doesn't guarantee higher allocations regardless of performance.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences is absolute and cannot be challenged in court.
2.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute a death sentence.
3.  The President's power extends only to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
4. The President's power extends to offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to commute death sentences. Statement 4 is also correct; the President's pardon power extends to offenses under laws related to matters within the Union's executive power.  Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President's power is significant, it's not absolute.  Judicial review exists in certain limited circumstances.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The President's power extends beyond court-martial sentences to include sentences from other courts for offenses under Union laws.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India:**

1. A curative petition is the first remedy available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions is explicitly mentioned in Article 137 of the Constitution.
3. The concept of curative petitions was first formally recognized in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.
4. A curative petition can be filed if the petitioner alleges a violation of principles of natural justice.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: The case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.* is where the Supreme Court formally recognized the concept of curative petitions. Statement 4 is also correct; a curative petition can be filed based on allegations of violations of natural justice, along with other grounds like undisclosed connections or bias. Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last* resort, not the first, after review petitions have been exhausted.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Article 137 deals with the Supreme Court's review power, not the curative petition process. The power for curative petitions stems from Article 142's inherent power of the Court to do complete justice.  Hence, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following features of the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. FTSCs were launched as a state-sponsored scheme in 2019.
2.  The expenditure for FTSCs is primarily funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.
3.  FTSCs are primarily focused on cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act only.
4.  The implementation of FTSCs is overseen by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.

How many of the statements given above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: The Nirbhaya Fund is the primary source of funding for FTSCs.  Statement 4 is correct: The Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for implementing the FTSC scheme. Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. While a significant portion focuses on POCSO cases, FTSCs also handle rape cases in general.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1.  The DPBI is responsible for regulating the use of personal data in the banking sector exclusively.
2.  The DPBI's decisions can be directly appealed to the Supreme Court of India.
3.  Data principals have the right to obtain information about the processing of their personal data.
4.  The DPBI can direct data fiduciaries to take measures in case of data breaches.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: Data principals (individuals whose data is being processed) have the right to access information about how their data is being handled. Statement 4 is also correct: The DPBI has the power to direct data fiduciaries (entities processing the data) to take remedial action in case of data breaches. Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DPBI's mandate is broader than just the banking sector; it covers personal data across various sectors. Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the obligations of Data Fiduciaries under the Digital Personal Data Protection Act:**

1. Data fiduciaries are required to ensure the accuracy of data but not necessarily its completeness.
2.  Data fiduciaries must inform the DPBI and affected persons in the event of a data breach.
3.  Data fiduciaries are obligated to retain personal data indefinitely, even after the purpose for collection has been met.
4.  Data fiduciaries are required to build reasonable security safeguards to prevent data breaches.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct:  Data fiduciaries are legally bound to report data breaches to both the DPBI and the affected individuals. Statement 4 is also correct:  Building and maintaining reasonable security measures to protect against data breaches is a key obligation for data fiduciaries. Statement 1 is incorrect. Data fiduciaries must ensure both the accuracy *and* completeness of the data they process. Statement 3 is incorrect. Data should be erased once the purpose of collection is fulfilled unless legally required for retention.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.



**6. Consider the following statements about the  Mediation Service Providers as defined in the relevant legislation:**

1. Only courts can act as mediation service providers.
2.  Mediation service providers must be recognized by the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI).
3.  Agreements reached through mediation are legally binding and enforceable.
4.  A mediated settlement can be challenged in court only on grounds of fraud or corruption.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: Mediated settlements have the same legal standing as court judgments, making them binding and enforceable. Statement 4 is partially correct; although fraud and corruption are grounds for challenge, other grounds, like impersonation or disputes unsuitable for mediation, are also possible. Statement 1 is incorrect. Mediation can be conducted by various entities, including those recognized by the MCI and authorities under the Legal Services Authorities Act. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MCI) is not the relevant ministry for recognition of mediation service providers. The correct ministry would be the relevant law ministry or a body specifically designated for this purpose.

Statement 2 is correct: Article 324 empowers the ECI to supervise, direct, and control elections, forming the basis for the MCC's enforcement. Statement 4 is also correct: The MCC's scope includes all political parties, candidates, and government employees during the election period.

**Explanation:**

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  Parliament, with the President's recommendation, passes laws to create new states under Article 3. Statement 4 is incorrect; state legislatures do not have the primary authority for state formation.  The power rests with Parliament.


**13. Consider the following about the  National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
2.  The NHRC's headquarters is in Mumbai.

Statement 3 is incorrect: GANHRI's accreditation is based on several factors, not just budget. Statement 4 is correct: Protecting marginalized groups is a key part of the NHRC's mandate. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**14. Consider the following features of the Indian Postal System:**

1. The Department of Posts is governed by the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
2.  The Director General of Posts (DGPS) has the power to make regulations regarding postal services.
3.  The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, contains detailed penal provisions for various postal offenses.

**15. Consider the following statements about Special Category States (SCS):**

1. The concept of SCS was first introduced in 1969 on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
2.  The Constitution explicitly categorizes certain states as SCS states.
3.  States granted SCS used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations led to the introduction of SCS. Statement 2 is incorrect: The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS. Statement 3 is correct: The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for distributing grants to SCS. Statement 4 is incorrect: The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas".
3.  It involves only elected representatives at the Panchayat level.
4. The thematic approach is based on the localization of SDGs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) explicitly aims to increase public participation in creating Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  It was indeed launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. The campaign's thematic approach directly uses a localized version of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), aligning with a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" approach.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While elected representatives are involved, the Abhiyan also actively includes government frontline workers and Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs) and other stakeholders at all three tiers of Panchayats. This inclusive approach is crucial for effective grassroots planning and implementation.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the inclusive nature of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan beyond just the involvement of elected officials.


2. Consider the following regarding the auditing of local bodies in India:

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) was established in Gujarat.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) audits local bodies through ELFA/DLFA in most states.
3. AuditOnline, an application for online auditing of panchayat accounts, was launched in 2021.
4. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 deal with the auditing of local bodies.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) was indeed inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  The CAG's role in auditing local bodies is established through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states, working under the CAG's supervision.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While AuditOnline is a tool for online auditing of panchayat accounts, aimed at enhancing accountability, the year mentioned is incorrect.  The year of launch should be verified.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 primarily deal with local self-governance, empowering Panchayats and Urban Local Bodies, but the auditing mechanism is governed separately, primarily through the CAG and state-level agencies. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between provisions related to governance and auditing mechanisms.


3. Consider the following regarding mercy petitions and curative petitions in India:

1. The President's power to grant pardons is derived from Article 73 of the Constitution.
2. A curative petition is the last constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
3. Curative petitions are primarily based on violations of the principles of natural justice.
4. The Supreme Court's power to grant curative petitions stems from Article 141.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after their review petition is rejected by the Supreme Court.  The grounds for a curative petition often center on violations of natural justice, such as a judge's undisclosed conflict of interest or a clear apprehension of bias.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., is enshrined in Article 72, not Article 73.  Article 73 deals with the extent of the executive power of the Union.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's inherent power to do complete justice, enabling curative petitions, is derived from Article 142, not Article 141, which pertains to the Supreme Court's judgments being binding on all courts. The question tests the candidate's precise knowledge of constitutional provisions and their applications.


4. Consider the following statements related to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Home Affairs is the coordinating agency for RTI.
3. The "Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government" case established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.
4. The RTI Act is based on international human rights covenants.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, strengthening the right to information. The Act's foundation lies in international human rights instruments like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, recognizing access to information as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act is the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions (MoPPG&P), not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the "Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government" case significantly advanced the cause of transparency and access to information, it did not explicitly establish RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19. The Supreme Court's interpretation of Article 19 has evolved over time to include elements of the right to information, but it isn't directly codified under Article 19. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the evolution of RTI and its legal basis.


5. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):

1. FTSCs are a state-sponsored scheme.
2. They primarily handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
3.  Funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund.
4. The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, implements the FTSC scheme.


Which of the statements above is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2 and 3
(b) 2, 3 and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. FTSCs primarily deal with cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases, aiming for swift justice. The Nirbhaya Fund provides crucial financial support for the scheme's implementation. The Department of Justice, under the Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for overseeing the FTSC scheme.

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, not a state-sponsored one, implying shared funding and coordination between the central and state governments. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the funding and implementation mechanisms of the FTSC scheme.


6. Consider the following features of the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023:

1. It establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) as the main regulatory body.
2.  Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.
3. The Act mandates that all data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer.
4. Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Central Information Commission (CIC).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The DPDP Act establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data protection. Data principals (individuals whose data is being processed) have the right to request corrections or erasure of inaccurate or unnecessary personal data.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) are required to appoint a data protection officer and an independent auditor, the Act doesn't mandate this for all data fiduciaries.  The distinction between SDFs and other data fiduciaries is critical.

Statement 4 is incorrect. Appeals against DPBI decisions are handled by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Central Information Commission (CIC).  The question distinguishes the candidate's understanding of the specific regulatory mechanisms and appellate processes under the DPDP Act.


7. Consider the following regarding Cantonment Boards in India:

1. Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company.
2.  The administration of cantonments falls under the State List in the Seventh Schedule.
3. Cantonment Boards are responsible for civic functions like water supply and primary education.
4. The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 3 and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Cantonments have historical roots in the British East India Company's military presence. Cantonment Boards perform essential civic functions, including water supply, sanitation, and primary education for both military and civilian populations. The Station Commander holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The administration of cantonments falls under the Union List (Entry 3), reflecting the central government's control over defense matters. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the administrative structure and historical context of cantonments in India.


8. Consider the following statements related to the constitutionalization of environmental issues:

1. A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from climate change's adverse effects to Article 21.
2. The Supreme Court judgment in  'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' focused on protecting the Great Indian Bustard.
3. The judgment expanded the scope of fundamental rights under Article 19.
4.  The judgment primarily relied on Articles 14 and 21 to establish the right to a healthy environment.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. A recent Supreme Court judgment did indeed connect the right to a healthy environment and freedom from the detrimental impacts of climate change to the right to life (Article 21). The case of 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' directly addressed the conservation of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat. The judgment primarily used Articles 14 (equality) and 21 (right to life) to broaden the scope of environmental protection as a fundamental right.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the judgment expanded the interpretation of fundamental rights, it primarily focused on Articles 14 and 21, not Article 19 (freedom of speech, etc.). The question tests the candidate's understanding of the legal reasoning and specific constitutional articles invoked in the Supreme Court's judgment.


9. Consider the following statements about Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRMs) in India:

1. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is a designated nodal agency for handling grievances.
2.  CPGRAMS is an online platform for lodging grievances with state governments only.
3. The Sevottam model includes GRM as one of its modules.
4.  District Magistrates are always designated as District Public Grievance Officers.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. DARPG is a key nodal agency for handling grievances at the central level. The Sevottam model, aimed at improving public service delivery, explicitly includes a robust Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) as a core component.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is a pan-India platform connecting citizens with both central and state government ministries and departments.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While District Magistrates often serve as District Public Grievance Officers, this isn't universally true across all states. Some states may have different designations or mechanisms. The question challenges the candidate's understanding of the various layers and actors involved in grievance redressal.


10. Consider the following statements about the  National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body.
2.  The NCSC investigates complaints related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3. The NCSC's chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India.
4. The NCSC submits its reports to the Parliament.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Indian Constitution. It investigates complaints of atrocities and discrimination against Scheduled Castes.  The President appoints the chairperson and members of the commission. The NCSC presents its reports and findings to the Parliament, ensuring accountability and transparency. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the composition, powers, and functions of the NCSC.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the powers of the Director-General of Postal Services (DGPS):**

1.  The DGPS can make regulations concerning service charges.
2.  The DGPS has the authority to issue postage stamps.
3.  The DGPS can independently intercept postal articles for national security reasons.
4.  The DGPS is responsible for prescribing liability for postal services.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the powers of the DGPS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The DGPS does indeed have the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services (statement 1) and the supply and sale of postage stamps (statement 2).  Statement 4 is also correct as the act allows the post office to prescribe liability for its services. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the government can intercept postal articles under specific circumstances (for reasons of national security etc.), this power does not rest solely with the DGPS; it's a power exercised by the government, not the DGPS independently.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the DGPS's powers.


**2. Consider the following regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India:**

1.  Its headquarters are in Mumbai.
2.  It is a constitutional body established by the Indian Constitution.
3.  Its accreditation with the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has been deferred in recent years.
4.  It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC's headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai. Statement 2 is incorrect because the NHRC is a statutory body, established by an Act of Parliament (the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993), not a constitutional body enshrined in the Indian Constitution itself. Statement 3 is correct; the NHRC's GANHRI accreditation has faced recent deferrals. Statement 4 is also correct, accurately stating the act under which the NHRC was created. Thus, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign):**

1.  It was launched by the Ministry of Rural Development.
2.  It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
3.  It utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.
4.  It exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayats.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Statements 2 and 3 are correct: the Abhiyan aims to increase public participation in PDP creation and uses the PDI to pinpoint areas needing improvement. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while Gram Panchayats are involved, the Abhiyan encompasses all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District). Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the Abhiyan's characteristics.


**4. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1.  They are primarily funded through the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The current framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
3.  Funding patterns for core schemes vary based on the state's location (North-Eastern states receive different funding compared to other states).
4.  NITI Aayog has no role in monitoring CSSs.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding CSSs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

All three statements (1, 2, and 3) are accurate.  CSS funds are indeed routed through the Consolidated Fund of States (statement 1). The current CSS structure is based on the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers (statement 2).  The funding pattern for core schemes varies depending on whether a state is in the North-East or Himalayan region, demonstrating different Centre:State funding ratios (statement 3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; NITI Aayog *does* play a role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations.


**5. Consider the following statements related to Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission abolished the SCS.
3.  SCS states previously received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  The current special funding for Northeastern and Himalayan states is a direct continuation of the SCS provisions.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS. Statement 2 is correct; the 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS designation. Statement 3 is correct; SCS states previously used the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for grants. Statement 4 is incorrect; the current funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on recommendations from a Chief Ministers' Sub-Group, not a direct continuation of SCS.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**6. Consider the following about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was a result of the recommendations of the Dar Commission.
2. It applies to the entire state of Jammu & Kashmir.
3. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.
4. It is primarily concerned with the governance of tribal areas.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule resulted from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Dar Commission. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Sixth Schedule's application is limited to specific areas, primarily in Northeast India, not the whole of Jammu & Kashmir. Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Sixth Schedule does indeed establish autonomous district councils and primarily deals with the governance of tribal areas in the specified regions.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Supreme Court has declared RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a).
3. The Central Information Commission is appointed by the Election Commission of India.
4. Cooperative societies are always considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the RTI Act of 2005 replaced the 2002 Act. Statement 2 is partially correct. While the Supreme Court did uphold the importance of RTI in the context of Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression), it didn't explicitly declare it a fundamental right in the same way other fundamental rights are defined.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the CIC is appointed by the President, not the Election Commission.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the status of cooperative societies as Public Authorities under the RTI Act has been subject to judicial interpretation and varies depending on specific circumstances and state laws. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the President's power on Mercy Petitions:**

1. The President can commute a death sentence.
2. The President's power extends to offenses under all laws irrespective of whether they are related to Union executive power.
3. The President's power on mercy petitions is derived from Article 73 of the Constitution.
4. A mercy petition can be rejected by the President.

How many of these statements are correct regarding the President's powers on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. The President can indeed commute a death sentence and also reject a mercy petition. Statement 2 is incorrect because the President's power extends to offenses where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends (Article 72).  Statement 3 is incorrect; the power is derived from Article 72, not Article 73. Article 73 deals with the extent of the executive power of the Union. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1. The DPBI is responsible for appointing data protection officers for all data fiduciaries.
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions go to the Supreme Court.
3. The DPBI can impose penalties for non-compliance with data protection regulations.
4. The DPBI is responsible for directing data fiduciaries to address data breaches.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the DPBI's functions?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while the DPBI may influence the appointment of data protection officers, it doesn't directly appoint them for *all* data fiduciaries.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; appeals go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court. Statements 3 and 4 are correct; the DPBI can impose penalties and directs data fiduciaries to take action in case of data breaches. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on providing services to urban populations.
2. CSCs are one of the pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
3. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development.
4. CSCs offer a range of services including G2C, B2C, and financial services.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics of CSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; CSCs primarily target rural populations. Statement 2 is correct; CSCs are a key component of the NeGP. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CSC SPV is under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Statement 4 is correct; CSCs offer a diverse range of services.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance the participation of elected representatives in Panchayat Development Plan (PDP) preparation.
2.  It utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.
3.  The campaign's implementation involves only Gram Sabhas at the village level.
4.  The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.  The Abhiyan explicitly aims to accelerate people's participation, including elected representatives, in PDP preparation.  It leverages the PDI to identify thematic gaps for targeted development. Finally, the approved GPDPs are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal for transparency and accessibility.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Abhiyan's implementation extends beyond Gram Sabhas to encompass Block Sabhas and District Sabhas, reflecting a multi-tiered approach to participatory planning.


**2. Consider the following features of the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems:**

1.  FPTP systems typically lead to the formation of stable governments.
2. PR systems ensure representation of all parties based on their vote share.
3.  In FPTP, every constituency elects multiple representatives.
4.  PR systems can result in coalition governments, potentially impacting stability.

Which of the above features correctly distinguish between FPTP and PR systems?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately contrast the two systems. FPTP often results in a single party majority, leading to stable government formation. PR, by its nature, aims to allocate seats proportionally to votes received, ensuring broader representation. However, this can lead to coalition governments, which may be less stable than single-party governments. Statement 3 is incorrect; FPTP systems typically elect one representative per constituency.


**3. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only in cases involving offences against Union laws.
2.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3.  The President can reject a mercy petition only if the crime involved is against national security.
4.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The President's power under Article 72 explicitly includes the authority to commute death sentences. Statement 1 is incorrect because the President's power extends to cases involving court-martial sentences and other offenses, not solely those against Union laws. Statement 3 is wrong because the President's power to reject a mercy petition is not limited to national security cases.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the President's decision on mercy petitions is generally considered final and not subject to judicial review, though the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review in exceptional circumstances.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Parliamentary Committees:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee was first established after India's independence.
2. The Estimates Committee examines the efficiency of government administration.
3. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) has members from both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the above statements regarding Parliamentary Committees are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Estimates Committee is indeed tasked with examining administrative efficiency, and the PCOL comprises members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Public Accounts Committee was established in 1921. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the Constitution provides the framework, the specific authority and functions of Parliamentary Committees are also established by parliamentary rules and procedures.


**5. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are funded solely by the central government.
2.  CSSs are implemented only in sectors listed under the Union List of the Constitution.
3.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report, and the 14th Finance Commission did recommend phasing them out.  Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the centre and states, and they are implemented across sectors listed in both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.


**6. Consider the following aspects of the Aadhaar Act:**

1. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of citizenship.
2.  Aadhaar metadata is stored indefinitely.
3.  The Supreme Court has declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.
4.  The Aadhaar Act mandates Aadhaar for opening bank accounts.


Which of the above statements regarding the Aadhaar Act is/are accurate?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) Only three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are accurate. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address, not citizenship.  Aadhaar metadata is not stored indefinitely; the Supreme Court has mandated limits on storage duration. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, subject to certain conditions. Finally, the Aadhaar Act does not mandate Aadhaar for opening bank accounts.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It is based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states.
3.  It applies uniformly across all states in India.
4.  It was introduced in the Constitution in 1971.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the Sixth Schedule. It is indeed based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations and provides for autonomous district councils in specified states. Statement 3 is incorrect; it applies only to certain states. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it was introduced along with the rest of the Constitution.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1. The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions is responsible for overseeing the GRM.
2.  The timelines for grievance redressal have been increased.
3.  The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) ranks Ministries/Departments.

Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the GRM?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions plays a key role in the GRM, and the GRAI is used for ranking. Statement 2 is incorrect; timelines have been reduced, not increased. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the guidelines mandate grievance cells in Ministries/Departments, not necessarily all public sector undertakings.


**9. Consider the following concerning Curative Petitions:**

1.  It is the last constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  It is based on the power of the Supreme Court under Article 142.
3.  It can be filed if there's a violation of principles of natural justice.
4.  It is a remedy available only in criminal cases.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Curative Petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  A curative petition is the last resort after review petition dismissal, it stems from Article 142's power to do complete justice, and it can be filed for natural justice violations.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Curative Petitions are not limited to criminal cases.


**10. Consider the following about Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  They have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the 2008 Act and have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters. Statement 3 is incorrect; they are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but by principles of natural justice.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; appeals go to the Court of Session (criminal) and the District Court (civil).




1. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar:

1.  It captures details like caste, religion, income, health, and geography.
2.  It serves as definitive proof of citizenship and domicile.
3.  Its architecture enables online authentication from anywhere in the country.
4.  It is mandatory for opening bank accounts and mobile/internet connections.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding Aadhaar's features and legal standing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are incorrect.  Aadhaar, by design, does not collect caste, religion, income, health, or geographic details (Statement 1 is false).  It is explicitly not proof of citizenship or domicile; it only establishes identity (Statement 2 is false). While Aadhaar's architecture allows for nationwide online authentication (Statement 3 is true), the Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile/internet connections (Statement 4 is false).  The 2018 Supreme Court judgment clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced for other services.


2. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):

1.  They are funded solely by the central government.
2.  They are implemented exclusively in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
3.  The current framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the features and history of CSS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. CSS are jointly funded by the central and state governments (Statement 1 is false). They are implemented in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists (Statement 2 is false).  CSS were first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Fourth (Statement 4 is false). Only statement 3 is correct, reflecting the current framework's basis.


3. Consider the following statements concerning Special Category States (SCS):

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2.  Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted SCS status based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.
3.  SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, SCS ceased to exist.


Which of the above statements accurately reflects the historical context and constitutional basis of SCS in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain a provision for categorizing states as SCS (Statement 1 is false). While Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted special status, this was based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Fourth (Statement 2 is false). Statement 3 is correct:  SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. Statement 4 is also correct: The 14th Finance Commission recommended the cessation of SCS, and consequently, no new SCS have been granted since.


4. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1. It was a result of the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2.  It applies to all states in the North-Eastern region.
3. It deals primarily with the administration of tribal areas.
4. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.


Which of the above statements accurately describe features of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee (Statement 1 is false).  It doesn't apply to all North-Eastern states; its application is specific to certain areas within those states (Statement 2 is false). Statements 3 and 4 are correct: The Sixth Schedule primarily concerns the administration of tribal areas and provides for the creation of autonomous district councils within those areas.


5. Consider the following statements about Parliamentary Committees:

1.  They are appointed solely by the Lok Sabha Speaker.
2.  Their authority stems directly from Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution.
3.  The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of only state governments.
4.  The Estimates Committee was first constituted in 1921.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the functioning and powers of Parliamentary Committees in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are incorrect. Parliamentary Committees are appointed or elected by the House or nominated by the Speaker (Statement 1 is false).  Their authority derives from Articles 105 and 118, but also from established parliamentary conventions (Statement 2 is partially correct, but needs more detail). The Public Accounts Committee audits the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India, not just state governments (Statement 3 is false). The Estimates Committee was first constituted in 1950, not 1921 (Statement 4 is false).


6. Consider the following about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:

1. It aims to reduce people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" in 2018.
3.  It involves only elected representatives in the planning process.
4.  It uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the objectives and implementation of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to *accelerate* people's participation (Statement 1 is false). It involves various stakeholders including elected representatives, government workers, CBOs, and SHGs (Statement 3 is false). While the PDI is used, the statement implies exclusive reliance on it, which isn't entirely true (Statement 4 is false). Only statement 2 correctly identifies the program's launch name and year.


7. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against Union laws.
2.  The President's power extends to death sentences imposed by civil courts but not court martials.
3.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
4. The President can commute a death sentence to life imprisonment.


How many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. Article 72 extends to pardons for offenses against both Union and State laws, as well as court-martial sentences (Statement 1 is false). The President's power explicitly includes death sentences from both civil courts and court martials (Statement 2 is false).  Statement 3 is partially true; while the Supreme Court can interpret Article 72's scope, direct judicial review is limited. Statement 4 is correct, as the President can commute sentences, including death sentences.


8. Consider the following about Curative Petitions:

1.  They are available after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2.  Their basis lies in Article 142 of the Constitution.
3.  They can be filed only when there's a clear violation of substantive law.
4. They are the first constitutional remedy available.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT concerning the nature and availability of Curative Petitions in India's legal system?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. Curative petitions are available after the dismissal of a review petition, not a writ petition (Statement 1 is false). While Article 142 provides the basis for the Supreme Court's power to do complete justice, the grounds for a curative petition are more specific (Statement 3 is false).  A curative petition is the *last*, not first, resort (Statement 4 is false). Only Statement 2 is correct, highlighting the constitutional basis of curative petitions.


9. Consider the following features of the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:

1.  The Act was enacted in October 2005.
2.  It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
3.  The Department of Personnel and Training coordinates the Act's implementation.
4.  The Act mandates disclosure of all information held by public authorities.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT regarding the RTI Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act was enacted in June 2005 and came into force in October 2005 (Statement 1 is false).  The other statements accurately reflect aspects of the RTI Act: It replaced the 2002 Act (Statement 2 is true), the Department of Personnel and Training coordinates its implementation (Statement 3 is true), and the Act does not mandate disclosure of *all* information, as certain exemptions exist (Statement 4 is true).


10. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:

1.  Cantonments are exclusively for military personnel.
2.  The first cantonment was established after Indian independence.
3.  Cantonment Boards are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.
4.  Their local self-government is a subject matter of the State List in the Constitution.

How many of the above statements are INCORRECT about the nature and administration of Cantonment Boards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. Cantonments house both military and civilian populations (Statement 1 is false).  The first cantonment was established by the East India Company well before independence (Statement 2 is false). The local self-government of cantonments falls under the Union List, not the State List (Statement 4 is false). Only Statement 3 is correct, reflecting the Ministry of Defence's administrative oversight.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:

1. It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  The campaign involves structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas at the village level.
4. The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary aim of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is to enhance people's participation in the creation of PDPs, ensuring plans reflect local needs and priorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the campaign's essence aligns with the inclusive development philosophy,  it was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Abhiyan utilizes structured meetings at various levels (Ward, Mahila, Gram Sabhas) to facilitate participatory planning.  This bottom-up approach ensures local voices are heard.

Statement 4 is correct.  Transparency and accountability are key aspects. The publication of approved GPDPs on the e-Gram Swaraj portal ensures public access and scrutiny.


Therefore, three of the four statements accurately reflect the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's characteristics and objectives.  The incorrect statement relates to the launching ministry.



2. Consider the following features of Gram Nyayalayas:

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, excluding Nagaland and certain tribal areas.
2.  They function as courts of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, appointed by the state government in consultation with the High Court.
3. They primarily handle civil disputes, with limited jurisdiction over criminal matters.
4.  They are bound by the rules of evidence stipulated in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the key features of Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes these courts, with specific exclusions mentioned in the Act itself.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed courts of Judicial Magistrate First Class, with the appointment process involving both state and High Court authorities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction, designed to resolve petty disputes at the village level.  Their jurisdiction is not limited to only civil disputes.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While they aim for conciliation, Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, instead operating under principles of natural justice.


Therefore, only two of the four statements accurately reflect the key features of Gram Nyayalayas.  The inaccuracies lie in the description of their jurisdiction and the application of evidence rules.



3. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:

1. It is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish for contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.
3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct justice.
4. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, does not differentiate between civil and criminal contempt.


Which of the above statements correctly describes aspects of Contempt of Court in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the primary legislation defining and outlining procedures for dealing with contempt of court.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the inherent power to punish for contempt to uphold their authority and the integrity of the judicial process.

Statement 3 is correct.  The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is well-established. Civil contempt involves disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct justice.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, clearly distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt, outlining different procedures and penalties for each.


Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of contempt of court in India.  Statement 4 presents a misconception about the Act's provisions.


4. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016:

1.  Aadhaar primarily serves as proof of Indian citizenship.
2.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in its 2018 judgment.
3. The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.
4.  The Supreme Court mandated Aadhaar for opening bank accounts and mobile connections.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's ruling on the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and the nature of Aadhaar?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court, in its 2018 judgment, upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, while also imposing certain limitations on its application and data handling.

Statement 3 is correct. The Supreme Court's ruling stipulated that Aadhaar metadata should not be stored for more than six months to protect privacy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar cannot be *mandatory* for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  While it can be used for accessing certain government welfare schemes, it cannot be imposed universally for all private services.

Therefore, only one statement (3) accurately reflects the Supreme Court's judgment and the nature of Aadhaar.  The other statements contain significant inaccuracies.



5. Consider the following about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):

1. CSSs are funded solely by the central government.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers.
3.  CSSs are implemented exclusively in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
4.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of CSSs.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the nature and funding of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, sharing the financial burden of implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The current structure of CSSs is largely influenced by the recommendations of the 2015 report by the sub-group of Chief Ministers on rationalization of CSSs.

Statement 3 is incorrect. CSSs cover sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.  They are not limited to the Union List.

Statement 4 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended a shift away from the traditional CSS model, leading to their discontinuation as a distinct category of schemes.  The funding mechanisms for similar programs have evolved since then.

Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) correctly describe aspects of CSSs.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding funding and the constitutional lists involved.


6. Consider the following features of the Lokpal:

1.  The Lokpal's inquiry wing is headed by a Director of Investigation, assisted by three Superintendents of Police.
2. The Lokpal has the power to supersede the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in any investigation.
3. The Lokpal's prosecution wing handles cases related to offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.
4. The Lokpal serves as the final appellate authority for all public grievances.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the structure and powers of the Lokpal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Lokpal's inquiry wing has a hierarchical structure, with the Director of Inquiry at the top, supported by Superintendents of Police and other staff.

Statement 2 is partially correct but needs clarification. The Lokpal has the power to *superintend and direct* central investigation agencies, including the CBI, for cases referred to it, not to supersede them entirely.  The CBI retains its independence but operates under the Lokpal's direction for specific cases.

Statement 3 is correct. The Lokpal's prosecution wing is responsible for prosecuting public servants for offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, based on the inquiry wing's findings.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Lokpal's appellate authority is limited to cases involving corruption findings under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. It is not the final appellate authority for *all* public grievances.


Therefore, three statements (1, 2 with clarification, and 3) largely reflect the Lokpal's structure and powers. Statement 4 overstates the scope of its appellate jurisdiction.



7. Consider the following statements related to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):

1.  iCAL was inaugurated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.
2.  iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
3.  iCAL primarily focuses on capacity building for auditors in the private sector.
4.  iCAL functions as a knowledge center for addressing governance issues at the local level.


How many of the above statements accurately describe iCAL and its functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai, Maharashtra.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of iCAL is to set global benchmarks for auditing local governance, enhancing the quality and effectiveness of audits at the local level.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While iCAL contributes to capacity building, its focus is on auditors working within local governance bodies, not primarily the private sector.

Statement 4 is correct.  iCAL acts as a repository of knowledge and a think tank, addressing challenges and improving governance at the grassroot level.


Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately depict iCAL's location, aims, and functions.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies.


8. Consider the following regarding the auditing mechanism of local bodies in India:

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) does not have a mandate to audit local bodies.
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.
3. Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) audits are conducted under the direct supervision of the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
4. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 provide provisions for local self-governance, including auditing mechanisms.


How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the auditing of local bodies in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG does have a mandate to audit local bodies, derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.  This is a crucial aspect of financial accountability at the local level.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a significant technological advancement, streamlining the auditing process and promoting transparency.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While ELFA/DLFA conduct audits, they operate under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG, not the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.

Statement 4 is correct.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts laid the foundation for local self-governance, which includes provisions for financial accountability and auditing mechanisms.


Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the auditing mechanisms for local bodies in India.  Statements 1 and 3 contain inaccuracies regarding the CAG's role and the supervisory authority for ELFA/DLFA.


9. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It grants special autonomy to tribal areas within Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
3. It mandates the establishment of District Councils to administer these areas.
4. It provides for the establishment of a separate judiciary for the Sixth Schedule areas.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the provisions of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee's report played a crucial role in shaping the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule grants special autonomy to certain tribal areas within the four states mentioned (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram).  This autonomy is designed to protect the unique cultural and administrative needs of these areas.

Statement 3 is correct.  District Councils are established under the Sixth Schedule to administer the designated areas, giving them significant control over local governance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the Sixth Schedule provides for special administrative arrangements, it does not mandate a separate judiciary for the areas covered.  The existing judicial system continues to operate, but the District Councils have some administrative and legislative powers.


Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) accurately describe the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.  Statements 1 and 4 contain inaccuracies regarding the originating committee and the judicial structure.


10. Consider the following statements related to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, and its related rules:

1. The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.
2.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were introduced to repeal the CAA, 2019.
3.  The CAA, 2019, automatically grants citizenship to all individuals who meet its eligibility criteria.
4. The CAA, 2019, does not apply to the state of Assam.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the CAA, 2019, and its associated rules?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act, 1955, to provide a pathway to Indian citizenship for religious minorities (excluding Muslims) from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who had fled persecution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, were introduced to *enforce* the CAA, 2019, not to repeal it.  The rules provided the framework for implementing the Act's provisions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, does not automatically grant citizenship.  Individuals must apply and meet specific eligibility criteria, including proof of persecution and residence in India for a certain period.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the CAA, 2019, has faced challenges and legal debates, especially concerning its application in Assam, it does not explicitly exclude the state from its scope.  The application and implementation of the CAA in Assam have been a subject of considerable discussion and legal challenges.


Therefore, only one statement (1) accurately describes the CAA, 2019, and its associated rules.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or misconceptions about its implementation and legal implications.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008.
2.  Their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal cases, but only those involving petty disputes.
3. They are bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
4. Appeals from Gram Nyayalaya decisions go to the High Court.
5. The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the Union Government.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, provides the statutory backing for the establishment of these village courts.  Statement 2 is also correct. Gram Nyayalayas handle petty disputes, both civil and criminal in nature, aiming to provide accessible justice at the village level. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but operate on the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible and informal approach to dispute resolution.  Statement 4 is incorrect; appeals in criminal cases go to the Court of Session, and in civil cases to the District Court.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the Nyayadhikari is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the High Court, not the Union Government.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:**

1.  It is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish for contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution respectively.
3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court.
4.  Only the Supreme Court can hear appeals against contempt of court rulings.
5.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, does not differentiate between civil and criminal contempt.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines contempt, and Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution empower the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt. The descriptions of civil and criminal contempt are also accurate.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  Appeals against contempt of court rulings can be heard by both the Supreme Court (in cases concerning its own orders) and the High Courts (in cases concerning their own orders). Statement 5 is incorrect; the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, clearly distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following aspects of a Mercy Petition in India:**

1.  It is addressed to the President of India under Article 72 of the Constitution.
2.  The President can only grant pardons for offences against laws related to matters within the executive power of the Union.
3.  The President’s power extends to commuting death sentences.
4.  A mercy petition can be filed only after all appeals in the judicial process have been exhausted.
5. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not subject to judicial review.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Article 72 empowers the President to consider mercy petitions, and the President can indeed commute death sentences.  A mercy petition is typically filed after all avenues of judicial appeal have been exhausted. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's power predominantly concerns offences against Union laws, it's not strictly limited to them.  Statement 5 is incorrect. Although the President's decision carries significant weight, it's not entirely immune to judicial scrutiny in exceptional circumstances.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in India:**

1.  They are the final legal recourse available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The concept was established in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.
3.  They are based on the Supreme Court's power under Article 142 to do complete justice.
4.  A curative petition can be filed only if there was a violation of the principles of natural justice in the original trial.
5.  The Supreme Court has explicitly disallowed curative petitions in cases involving commercial disputes.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Curative petitions are indeed the last resort after review petitions are dismissed. The *Rupa Ashok Hurra* case is seminal in establishing this remedy, and it stems from the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142. Statement 4 is incorrect; while violation of natural justice is a ground, it's not the *only* ground for filing a curative petition. Other grounds include non-disclosure of a judge's connection with the case or apprehension of bias. Statement 5 is incorrect; the availability of curative petitions is not restricted based on the nature of the dispute (commercial or otherwise).  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They are established under a centrally sponsored scheme.
2. Their primary focus is on the speedy disposal of cases under the POCSO Act.
3.  Funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund.
4.  They are established and managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
5.  They handle only cases related to sexual offenses against women.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. FTSCs operate under a centrally sponsored scheme, primarily focusing on the swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases, with funding from the Nirbhaya Fund. Statement 4 is incorrect; FTSCs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Statement 5 is incorrect; while a significant portion of their workload involves cases of sexual offenses against women, they also address cases involving children under the POCSO Act.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019:**

1. It grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians.
2.  It applies to illegal migrants who entered India before December 31, 2014, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan.
3.  It excludes illegal migrants from certain tribal areas in the Northeast.
4.  It reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants from 11 years to 5 years.
5. It provides for the automatic revocation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards for those who acquire citizenship under the CAA.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The CAA provides a pathway to citizenship for certain religious minorities from the specified countries who entered India before a specific date and are excluded from certain areas in the Northeast. The naturalization period is indeed reduced. Statement 5 is incorrect. The CAA doesn't automatically revoke OCI cards; it provides grounds for the Central Government to cancel OCI registrations, but this is not automatic. Therefore, four statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Lokpal:**

1.  It is a statutory body established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.
2.  The Chairperson of the Lokpal must have been a judge of the Supreme Court or a High Court.
3.  The Lokpal has two wings: an inquiry wing and a prosecution wing.
4.  The Lokpal has the power to supersede the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in investigations.
5. The Lokpal's jurisdiction extends to all public servants, including those in the private sector.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Lokpal is a statutory body, has two wings (inquiry and prosecution), and can direct central investigating agencies, including the CBI. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the Chairperson often comes from a judicial background, it’s not a strict requirement.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the Lokpal's jurisdiction is primarily focused on public servants, and its reach into the private sector is limited. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. It replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is appointed by the President based on recommendations from a committee headed by the Prime Minister.
3.  The Act provides for the proactive disclosure of certain categories of information by public authorities.
4.  All cooperative societies are considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act.
5.  The RTI Act explicitly grants the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 2 are correct. The RTI Act replaced the earlier FOI Act, mandates proactive disclosure, and the appointment process of the CIC is as described. Statement 4 is incorrect; the status of cooperative societies as Public Authorities under the RTI Act can vary depending on their specific structure and registration.  Statement 5 is incorrect; while the Supreme Court has recognized the importance of RTI in relation to Article 19, the RTI Act itself doesn't explicitly grant it as a fundamental right. The right is derived through judicial interpretation. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**9. Consider the following regarding sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs):**

1.  It is permissible under Article 341 of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court has upheld the principle of sub-classification to address varying degrees of backwardness within SC communities.
3.  Sub-classification necessitates the creation of entirely new SC categories.
4. Sub-classification can be based solely on political expediency.
5.  The state must provide data on the inadequacy of representation in state services to justify sub-classification.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 are correct. Article 341 allows for the specification of SCs, and the Supreme Court has permitted sub-classification to address disparities within SC communities.  The state needs to justify sub-classification by providing data on underrepresentation. Statement 3 is incorrect; sub-classification doesn't involve creating entirely new SC categories but rather providing further differentiation within existing ones.  Statement 4 is incorrect; sub-classification cannot be based on political expediency but requires demonstrable backwardness. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1. They are primarily responsible for providing civic amenities to military personnel only.
2.  Their administration falls under the purview of the Union Government.
3.  The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.
4.  Cantonment Boards are established under the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
5. They were initially established by the British East India Company.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. Cantonment administration falls under the Union List, the Station Commander heads the Board, and the East India Company established the first cantonments. Statement 1 is incorrect; Cantonment Boards serve both military and civilian populations. Statement 4 is incorrect; Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is in accordance with the 74th, not the 73rd, Constitutional Amendment Act (which deals with Municipalities). Therefore, only three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's Fiscal Federalism:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among different states.
3.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states based on Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's Fiscal Federalism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 270 of the Indian Constitution mandates that the Finance Commission recommends the principles governing the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  This is a cornerstone of fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the States, a key component of fiscal federalism. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, deals with the distribution of resources *among* the states.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 empowers the Parliament to make any grants-in-aid to the States out of the Consolidated Fund of India. These grants are crucial for supporting states with weaker revenue bases.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Union government can borrow within or outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only *within* India (Article 293).  They cannot borrow from foreign sources without the Union's consent.


**2. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1. SCS was first introduced based on the recommendations of the Sixth Finance Commission.
2.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
3.  SCS states historically received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Special Category Status in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the *Fifth* Finance Commission, not the Sixth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain any explicit provision for classifying states as "Special Category States."  The designation is based on policy decisions and recommendations of Finance Commissions.

Statement 3 is correct.  Historically, states granted SCS received financial assistance based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, designed to address their specific developmental needs.

Statement 4 is correct. Following the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, the system of granting Special Category Status was effectively discontinued.  While special financial assistance continues to be provided to some states, it's not under the SCS framework.


**3. Consider the following features related to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The Ministry of External Affairs is responsible for implementing the FCRA.
2.  NGOs must obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds and submit Aadhaar details of office-bearers.
3.  Foreign funds received under FCRA can be used for any purpose deemed necessary by the NGO.
4.  Annual returns are not mandatory for NGOs registered under FCRA.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect provisions of the FCRA, particularly post-2020 amendments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), not the Ministry of External Affairs, is responsible for implementing and regulating the FCRA.

Statement 2 is correct. Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate prior permission for receiving foreign funds and require Aadhaar details of all office-bearers of NGOs seeking registration.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FCRA strictly regulates the use of foreign funds.  A significant portion must be utilized for the specific purpose for which the funds were granted, with restrictions on the amount allocated for administrative expenses.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The FCRA requires mandatory annual filing of returns by registered NGOs, and failure to comply can lead to penalties.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Aadhaar Act, 2016:**

1.  Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile.
2.  Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
3.  The Supreme Court declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional in its 2018 judgment.
4.  The Aadhaar Act mandates Aadhaar for opening bank accounts.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's findings on the Aadhaar Act and its implications?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address for residents of India; it does *not* serve as proof of citizenship or domicile.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment specified that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.  This is a crucial aspect of data privacy related to Aadhaar.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* upheld the *constitutionality* of the Aadhaar Act, while simultaneously emphasizing the need for protecting privacy rights.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or for accessing mobile or internet services.


**5. Consider the following about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1.  CSS are funded solely by the central government.
2.  CSS are implemented through the central government agencies.
3.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a report by a committee chaired by the Prime Minister.
4.  CSSs operate in sectors falling under the Union List of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSS are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, reflecting the principles of cooperative federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are implemented *through* state governments, although the central government provides funding and guidelines.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The current framework of CSSs is based on the report of a *Sub-Group of Chief Ministers* on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not a committee chaired by the Prime Minister.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  CSSs operate in sectors that fall under both the State List and the Concurrent List of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, indicating shared responsibilities between the Centre and States.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule was a result of the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states.
3. It applies to the entire state of Nagaland.
4. It is primarily concerned with the administration of Union Territories.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions and context of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Nehru Committee.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule (Article 244(2)) establishes autonomous district councils in certain states in Northeast India to safeguard the interests of tribal populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does not apply to the *entire* state of Nagaland. It applies to specific regions within certain states, including Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule focuses on the administration of specific tribal areas within states, not Union Territories.


**7. Consider the following regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1. The President can grant pardons for offences against any law.
2.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3. Article 73 empowers the President to grant pardons.
4. The President's power is absolute and cannot be challenged.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the President's powers concerning mercy petitions as per Article 72?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., extends to offenses against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends, not *any* law.  State-level offenses are outside this jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute death sentences.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Article *72*, not Article 73, deals with the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  Article 73 pertains to the extent of the executive power of the Union.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the President's power is significant, it's not absolute and is subject to judicial review in certain circumstances.


**8. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in the Indian Supreme Court:**

1.  A curative petition is the first remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.
2.  The power for curative petitions stems from Article 141 (power of Supreme Court to pronounce law).
3.  A curative petition can be filed if there is a violation of principles of natural justice during the trial.
4.  Curative petitions are commonly used in civil cases.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the nature and scope of curative petitions in the Supreme Court?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last* constitutional remedy available, filed only after a review petition has been dismissed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions flows from Article 142 (power to do complete justice), not Article 141 (law declared by Supreme Court is binding on all courts).

Statement 3 is correct. One of the grounds for filing a curative petition is a violation of the principles of natural justice during the proceedings leading to the judgment.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While curative petitions can theoretically be filed in both civil and criminal cases, they are most commonly associated with criminal cases, particularly those involving capital punishment.  Their use is extremely rare in civil matters.


**9. Consider the following regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are funded by the Nirbhaya Fund.
2.  FTSCs primarily handle cases related to the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.
3.  FTSCs are implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
4.  The FTSC scheme has no time limit.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the FTSCs scheme in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, established to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs primarily focus on cases related to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, not the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. FTSCs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The FTSC scheme has a defined time limit; it was initially launched in 2019 and has been extended up to 2026.  The scheme is not permanent.


1. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used to determine grants for SCS states.
3.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS ceased to exist.
4.  The current special funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not contain any provision for categorizing states as Special Category States (SCS).  The SCS was a classification used by the Central government to provide special financial assistance and other benefits to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. This was based on recommendations from Finance Commissions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Historically, SCS states received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, a method of distributing central funds.

Statement 3 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS classification, leading to its abolishment.  This was a significant shift in central-state financial relations.

Statement 4 is correct. The current financial assistance to Northeastern and Himalayan states is not based on SCS status but on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, reflecting a change in the approach to providing special assistance.


2. Consider the following features of Special Packages provided to Indian states:

1.  They are exclusively allocated based on demonstrable need.
2.  They are governed by specific constitutional provisions outlining eligibility criteria.
3.  They are an additional grant under Article 282.
4.  They are subject to strict parliamentary oversight and approval procedures.

Which of the above statements accurately describe Special Packages?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While need may be a factor considered, special packages are primarily discretionary, not solely determined by objective need assessment.  The decision to provide a special package involves political and strategic considerations beyond just quantifiable needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Special packages are not governed by specific constitutional provisions outlining eligibility criteria.  The provision of special packages is not a codified process with clear, pre-defined rules.  They are essentially ad hoc measures at the discretion of the central government.

Statement 3 is correct. Special packages are provided as additional grants under Article 282 of the Constitution, which allows for discretionary grants for any public purpose.  This article provides the legal basis for these ad hoc financial allocations.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The process for granting special packages isn't subject to the same level of parliamentary scrutiny and formal approval procedures as other budgetary allocations. While they might be discussed, they don't undergo the same rigorous legislative process.


3. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1.  It was established based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
3.  ADCs have a maximum of 20 elected members.
4.  ADCs and ARCs have authority over subjects like land revenue collection and mineral royalty regulation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was a result of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee was specifically tasked with addressing the governance challenges in the Northeastern states.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 244(2) of the Constitution, under which the Sixth Schedule operates, empowers the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs in specified tribal areas. This is a key feature of the Schedule's design.

Statement 3 is incorrect. ADCs consist of not more than 30 members, with a specific allocation for nominated and elected representatives.  The actual number of elected members can vary.

Statement 4 is correct. ADCs and ARCs have significant powers, including authority over land revenue, taxation, trade regulation, and the collection of royalties from mineral extraction. This reflects their role in managing resources within their areas.


4. Consider the following aspects of Fiscal Federalism in India:

1.  The Seventh Schedule outlines the distribution of tax revenue between the Union and States based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among different states.
3.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution.
4.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of Fiscal Federalism in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution delineates the tax bases between the Union and States (Article 246), but the actual distribution of revenue is determined by the Finance Commission and not directly defined in the Seventh Schedule.  The Finance Commission's recommendations guide the distribution, but the Schedule sets the broad framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes allocated to states from the central government. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, deals with the distribution of this share among the different states.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of financial assistance. This is a key mechanism for transferring resources to states.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Union government can borrow money both within and outside India (Article 292), state governments are restricted to borrowing only within India (Article 293). This is a crucial difference in their borrowing powers.


5. Consider the following statements about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):

1.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).
2.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes outside the National Development Agenda.
3.  Funding for CSSs is directly transferred to the states, bypassing the Consolidated Fund of the State.
4.  The funding pattern for core schemes varies between 90:10 and 60:40 for different states.


Which of the above statements accurately describe Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs)?

(a) 1 and 4
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current framework of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) is indeed based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, which was submitted in 2015. This report significantly shaped the design and implementation of CSSs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are designed to align with the National Development Agenda and contribute to achieving national goals.  They are not focused on schemes outside the national development priorities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  All transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State, ensuring transparency and accountability in the use of funds.  This is a crucial element of fiscal management.

Statement 4 is correct. The funding pattern for core schemes under CSSs varies, with a 90:10 Centre:State ratio for eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states, and a 60:40 ratio for other states.  This reflects the varying needs and developmental priorities of different regions.


6. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The entire state of Arunachal Pradesh falls under the designation of Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.

Statement 2 is correct. Parts of Rajasthan are designated as Protected Areas, requiring foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) to obtain permits for entry.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, defines these areas.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Sikkim is partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area, not entirely a Restricted Area.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, delineates these distinct zones within the state.

Statement 4 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, mandates that foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) need special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas.  This is a key aspect of access control in these sensitive regions.


7. Consider the following regarding the formation of new states in India:

1.  The process is solely governed by the provisions of Article 3 of the Constitution.
2.  The President's recommendation is required for introducing a bill related to state formation in Parliament.
3.  The process involves the mandatory consultation with state legislatures of affected states.
4.  The Supreme Court plays a crucial role in determining the boundaries of new states.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the formation of new states in India?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 3 of the Constitution is the primary legal basis, the process also involves other considerations and practices, including political negotiations and consultations.  It is not solely governed by Article 3.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill related to the formation of new states can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's recommendation.  This is a crucial constitutional safeguard.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While consultations may occur, they are not mandatory.  The process of state formation is primarily at the discretion of the Parliament and the President.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court does not have a direct role in determining boundaries.  The Parliament has the ultimate authority in this matter, though boundary disputes might end up in Court.


8. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:

1.  They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2018.
2.  They are located at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not 2018.  The year is a crucial detail in understanding the legal framework.

Statement 2 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are typically situated at the headquarters of the intermediate Panchayat, enabling easier access for villagers.

Statement 3 is correct.  They are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, giving them legal standing and jurisdiction.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate on the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence.


9. Consider the following regarding Contempt of Court in India:

1.  It is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1981.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Contempt of Court is primarily defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, not 1981. The year is a crucial detail for legal precision.

Statement 2 is correct.  Civil contempt refers to willful disobedience of court orders, judgments, or decrees.  This is a core element of civil contempt.

Statement 3 is correct.  Criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of courts, or interfere with the administration of justice. This protects the integrity of the judicial process.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court (Article 129) has the power to punish contempt, so do High Courts (Article 215).  Both levels of judiciary have this inherent power to maintain their authority.

1.  They were initially established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Panipat.
2.  Their administration falls under the purview of the Union Government.
3.  Cantonment Boards are headed by an elected President chosen by the civilian population.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments were established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey (1757), not Panipat.  The battle is a significant historical detail in understanding their origin.

Statement 2 is correct. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the Union List (Entry 3), placing them under the Union Government's purview.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Cantonment Board's President is the Station Commander (ex-officio), not an elected civilian.  This reflects the military's significant role in cantonment administration.

Statement 4 is correct.  Cantonment Boards are responsible for providing civic amenities such as public health, water supply, and primary education within cantonment areas.  This is their primary function.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense. This includes offenses against both Union and State laws, as well as court-martial sentences.

Statement 2 is correct. The President's power under Article 72 explicitly includes the authority to commute a death sentence, reducing it to a lesser punishment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While there have been judicial pronouncements on the process surrounding mercy petitions, the President's decision itself is not directly subject to judicial review.  This reflects the executive nature of the power.

Statement 4 is correct. Article 72 explicitly covers cases involving sentences by a court-martial, extending the President's pardoning power to military justice.


12. Consider the following about Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court:

1.  They are the last constitutional remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.
2.  They were established through the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.

Statement 2 is correct. The concept and procedure for curative petitions were established in the landmark case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.  This case shaped the legal understanding of curative petitions.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions flows from Article 142, which grants the court the power to do complete justice, not Article 141.  Article 141 deals with the binding nature of Supreme Court decisions.

Statement 4 is correct.  One of the grounds for filing a curative petition is to demonstrate a clear violation of the principles of natural justice during the proceedings that led to the original judgment.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs were launched as a *centrally* sponsored scheme in 2019, not a state-sponsored one.  The funding source and implementation indicate the central government's role.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nirbhaya Fund is the primary source of funding for FTSCs, highlighting the government's commitment to addressing crimes against women and children.

Statement 3 is incorrect. FTSCs are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the judicial focus of the initiative.

Statement 4 is correct.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the speedy disposal of cases related to rape and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  This is a crucial aspect of their mandate.

Statement 3 is incorrect. CSCs provide a range of services from government, private, and social sector entities, offering an integrated platform for various needs.

Statement 4 is incorrect. CSCs are overseen by the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which is under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The Ministry of Electronics & IT is responsible for the overall implementation of the CSC scheme.


1. Consider the following features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India:

1.  Funding routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.
2.  Based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
3.  Constitute around 10.4% of the Centre's budget expenditure.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the characteristics of CSSs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India.  The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  Funding for CSSs is channeled through the Consolidated Fund of the State.  They represent a significant portion of the central government's budget, approximately 10.4%. Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017, CSSs became the primary mechanism for specific purpose transfers from the Union to States.  Therefore, all four statements are correct, making option (d) the appropriate choice.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the accuracy of the provided information regarding CSS characteristics.

Which of the above statements correctly represent the objectives and scope of Mission Karmayogi?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Mission Karmayogi, under the NPCSCB, aims to modernize the Indian civil service.  It encompasses all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments. The program prioritizes aligning the civil service with India's developmental goals and national priorities.  Statement 4 is incorrect; Mission Karmayogi explicitly shifts from rule-based to role-based training and a competency-driven approach. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they either include the false statement 4 or omit crucial aspects of the initiative.


3. Consider the following elements related to India's fiscal federalism:

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Vertical devolution, as per the 15th Finance Commission, allocates 41% of the divisible pool to states. Grants-in-aid are constitutionally mandated under Article 275. Statement 1 is incorrect; horizontal devolution considers multiple factors beyond just population, including income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts. Statement 4 is incorrect; state governments can borrow only within India, not internationally, as per Article 293.  Therefore, only two statements are correct, making (b) the correct option.


4. Consider the following regarding the Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1.  The constitution explicitly defines provisions for SCS.
2.  SCS grants were based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.
4.  States like Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded SCS.


How many of the above statements concerning the Special Category Status are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Only statements 2 and 4 are correct. SCS grants were historically calculated using the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  Recently, states like Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have advocated for SCS.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the constitution lacks explicit provisions for SCS.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), stems from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. ADCs established under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers over areas such as forest management and agriculture. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Governor can establish both ADCs and ARCs (Autonomous Regional Councils). Statement 4 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule's applicability is limited to specific states, namely Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Thus, only statements 1 and 3 accurately represent aspects of the Sixth Schedule.


6. Consider the following regarding the process of forming new states in India:

1.  The President's recommendation is not required for introducing a bill related to state formation.
2.  Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states.

How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the process for forming new states in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 2 is correct. Parliament has the power to create new states by combining parts of existing ones, as per Article 3.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the President's recommendation is mandatory for introducing such a bill. Statement 3 is incorrect; Article 3 also covers altering areas, boundaries, or names of existing states. Statement 4 is incorrect; while Parliament holds the primary power, state legislatures may be involved in the process, particularly concerning the affected states' perspectives.  Therefore, only one statement (2) accurately describes the process of forming new states.


7. Consider the following concerning the auditing of local bodies in India:

1.  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies originates from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the auditing mechanisms of local bodies in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2 and 4 are correct. The CAG's authority over auditing local bodies is established by the 1971 Act.  AuditOnline facilitates online audits of panchayat accounts.  iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance. Statement 3 is incorrect; ELFA/DLFA operate under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision. Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct, making (c) the correct option.


8. Consider the following features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:

1.  It aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  It is implemented only at the Gram Panchayat level.
3.  It involves only elected representatives in the planning process.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3 and 4 are correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses on enhancing public participation in PDP preparation. It involves elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations.  The PDI is utilized to identify thematic gaps.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Abhiyan operates at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).  Therefore, three of the four statements accurately reflect the features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.


9. Consider the following about the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):

1.  The DPBI’s decisions are directly appealable to the Supreme Court of India.
2.  Data fiduciaries must inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a data breach.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected individuals about data breaches. The DPBI monitors compliance, imposes penalties, and addresses grievances. Data principals have the right to request corrections and erasure of their personal data. Statement 1 is incorrect; appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not directly to the Supreme Court.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


10. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:

2.  Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
3.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for opening bank accounts.

How many of the above statements regarding Aadhaar are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Only statement 4 is correct. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act in its 2018 judgment. Statement 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address, not citizenship or domicile. Statement 2 is incorrect; Aadhaar metadata storage is limited to six months. Statement 3 is incorrect; Aadhaar is not mandatory for opening bank accounts.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 87(1) in its original form required the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the beginning of each session.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, indeed modified this provision.  Statement 3 accurately reflects the current practice, though the specific details of the amendment might not be explicitly stated in the source.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The President is not constitutionally mandated to address both houses at the beginning of every year's first session. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.

1.  Article 99 outlines the oath-taking process before the President or a designated individual.
2.  The oath forms are specified in the Second Schedule of the Constitution.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 99 deals with the oath of office for MPs. Statement 2 is incorrect; the oath forms are found in the Third Schedule, not the Second. Statement 3 is accurate; Article 104 specifies the penalty for sitting in the House without taking the oath. Statement 4 is also correct; an individual can be appointed a minister without prior election to Parliament and participate in proceedings (though without voting rights). Therefore, three out of the four statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Citizenship Act, 1955:**

1.  It outlines five methods for acquiring citizenship: birth, descent, registration, naturalization, and incorporation of territory.
2.  It explicitly provides for dual citizenship.

(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Act details five ways to acquire citizenship. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Act does *not* provide for dual citizenship.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; cantonments have both military and civilian residents. Statement 2 is incorrect; Barrackpore was established in 1765, not 1775. Statement 3 is correct; cantonment administration falls under the Union List. Statement 4 is correct; the Cantonments Act, 2006, governs their administration, consistent with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act. Therefore, three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Supreme Court's recent judgment on climate change:**

1.  The judgment linked the right to be free from climate change's adverse effects to Article 14 (right to equality).

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, strengthening the provisions for access to information.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government*, established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19 (Freedom of Speech and Expression), not a Directive Principle of State Policy.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the committee recommending appointments to the CIC is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Vice President.  Statement 4 is incorrect.

**Explanation:**

The NCSC is a Constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution. The Law Commission of India is a statutory body established by an act of Parliament. The UPSC is a Constitutional body established under Article 320 of the Constitution. The Universal Postal Union is an intergovernmental organization, not a body within the Indian governance structure.

(b) Only two
(c) Three

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the MCC is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution. Statement 2 is incorrect; the MCC's scope extends beyond political parties and candidates to include the government in power and government employees.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while violations can have serious consequences, direct prosecution under the IPC is not automatic.  Enforcement relies on related statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951. Statement 4 is partially correct in that Article 324 empowers the Election Commission, but the MCC itself doesn't have constitutional backing.  The MCC's authority stems from the Election Commission's power to conduct free and fair elections.  Therefore, all four statements are incorrect.

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is incorrect; the CAG audits both Central and State government accounts, including those of substantially government-funded bodies.  Statement 3 is correct; the CAG enjoys this high precedence. Statement 4 is incorrect; the President can remove the CAG on the same grounds and in the same manner as a Supreme Court judge, which does not involve direct parliamentary recommendation.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

(b) 2 and 4

(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory, not a Constitutional body, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Statement 2 is incorrect; the committee recommending appointments to the NHRC is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Chief Justice of India. Statement 3 is correct; the NHRC possesses significant powers, including those of a civil court for specific purposes outlined in the relevant legislation.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CBI is a non-statutory body, not a Constitutional body.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The committee recommending the CBI Director's appointment includes the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India (not the Home Minister). Statement 3 is correct; the CBI's mandate largely focuses on such crimes. Statement 4 is incorrect; while both agencies have significant investigative powers, they operate under different legal frameworks and have distinct jurisdictions.  Therefore, all four statements are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following regarding the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, 1992:**

1. These amendments primarily deal with the establishment of the Election Commission of India.

3. These amendments mandate the CAG to directly audit the accounts of all PRIs and ULBs.
4. The AuditOnline application developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj is directly mandated by these amendments.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the 73rd and 74th amendments focus on local self-governance, not the Election Commission. Statement 2 is correct; these amendments introduced key provisions related to PRIs and ULBs. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the CAG has a role in auditing local bodies, direct auditing isn't solely mandated by these amendments; it flows from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971. Statement 4 is incorrect; the AuditOnline application is a later development to aid in the auditing process, not a direct outcome of the 1992 amendments. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.

(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indian Constitution outlines a framework for fiscal federalism, detailing how financial resources are shared between the Union and state governments.  Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but wholly assigned to states. Article 270 addresses the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and states, with the Finance Commission playing a crucial role in determining the share. Article 275 provides for grants-in-aid from the Union to states. Article 293 permits state governments to borrow money within India. Therefore, all four options (1, 2, 3, and 4) are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as elements of the fiscal federalism arrangement.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one constitutionally mandated aspect of fiscal federalism.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission's recommendation on the share of states from the divisible pool.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula used for grants to Special Category States.
3.  The criteria used by the 15th Finance Commission for horizontal devolution among states.
4.  The discretionary nature of special financial packages provided to states.


How many of the above relate to the distribution of financial resources between the Union and states in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements relate to the distribution of financial resources between the Union and states. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendation on the divisible pool's share directly influences the amount allocated to states. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, though historically significant, was a method for distributing funds to Special Category States, reflecting the principles of resource allocation. The 15th Finance Commission's criteria for horizontal devolution determine how resources are distributed among states based on various factors.  Special financial packages, while discretionary, are a mechanism for providing additional financial assistance to states facing specific challenges.  Therefore, all four points are relevant to the central theme of intergovernmental financial transfers in India's federal system.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution.
2.  Article 280 of the Constitution.
3.  The GST Council.
4.  The Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of Centrally Sponsored Schemes.

Which of the above are involved in defining or managing the fiscal relationship between the Union and state governments in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution delineates the powers of the Union and states regarding taxation, a fundamental aspect of their fiscal relationship. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission, a crucial body for adjudicating the sharing of resources. The GST Council plays a significant role in determining the levy and distribution of GST, a major revenue source. The Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, while not a constitutional body, has provided recommendations on Centrally Sponsored Schemes, which impact the fiscal relationship by influencing the flow of funds between the Union and states.  Therefore, all four elements play a role in shaping the fiscal federalism arrangement in India.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete as they omit at least one significant element.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of SCS.
3.  SCS states previously received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
4.  Special financial packages are constitutionally mandated alternatives to SCS.


Which of the statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) None of the statements


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Indian Constitution does not explicitly define or provide for Special Category Status.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the 14th Finance Commission recommended the cessation of the SCS system, not its continuation. Statement 4 is incorrect because special financial packages are discretionary and not a constitutional alternative to SCS. Only statement 3 is correct;  SCS states did historically receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the factual situation regarding SCS in India.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1.  It was implemented based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It covers the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh.
3.  It primarily addresses administrative arrangements in tribal areas.
4.  It mandates the inclusion of Ladakh under its provisions.


Which of the statements are accurate regarding the Sixth Schedule?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Sixth Schedule is a result of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations. Statement 3 is correct; it aims to provide a unique administrative structure for tribal areas. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the Sixth Schedule covers parts of several states, it does not encompass the entirety of Arunachal Pradesh. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule's applicability to Ladakh is not mandated and is a matter of ongoing debate. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct option.


**6. Consider the following statements about Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1.  They are entirely funded by the Union government.
2.  Their current framework is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.
3.  They constitute around 10.4% of the Centre's budget expenditure.
4.  Funding for CSSs is routed exclusively through the Consolidated Fund of India.


Which of the above statements are correct regarding CSSs?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; CSSs involve cost-sharing between the Union and state governments. Statement 4 is incorrect because funding is routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Union. Statements 2 and 3 are correct; the current framework is based on the 2015 report, and they constitute around 10.4% of central expenditure. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following aspects related to the formation of new states in India:**

1.  The President's recommendation is required for introducing a Bill related to state reorganization.
2.  Parliament can create a new state through a simple majority.
3.  State governments have the power to create new districts without any parliamentary intervention.
4.  The Fazl Ali Commission recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories.


Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The President's recommendation is necessary for Bills concerning state boundaries or names. Parliament can create new states with a simple majority. The Fazl Ali Commission's recommendations led to the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories. Statement 3 is incorrect; while states can create districts, the process often involves legislative or executive actions at the state level, but significant changes may require parliamentary approval.  Therefore, (c) is the correct option.


**8. Consider the following regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1.  It is a constitutional body.
2.  Its headquarters are in Mumbai.
3.  It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
4.  It has received 'A' status accreditation from GANHRI consistently.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the NHRC?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional one. Statement 2 is incorrect; its headquarters are in New Delhi. Statement 4 is incorrect; while it initially received 'A' status, its accreditation has been deferred in recent years. Only statement 3 is correct; the NHRC was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Therefore, only option (b) is accurate.


**9. Consider the following about the Indian Postal System:**

1.  The Department of Posts has the power to intercept postal articles for reasons related to national security.
2.  The Department of Posts is completely exempt from all liability concerning its services.
3.  The first post office in India was established by the East India Company in 1727.
4.  The present site of Kolkata's General Post Office was formerly the site of Fort William.


Which of the statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the government can intercept mail for security reasons. Statement 2 is incorrect; while there are exemptions from liability,  it's not a complete exemption. Statement 3 is correct; the East India Company established the first post office. Statement 4 is correct; the General Post Office in Kolkata occupies the site of the former Fort William.  Therefore, (b) is the correct option.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme:**

1.  It is a component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
2.  It is overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  It aims to establish a nationwide network of citizen service points.
4.  It primarily focuses on providing services to urban citizens.


Which of the above statements are accurate regarding CSCs?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; CSCs are a pillar of the NeGP. Statement 3 is correct;  they aim to create a widespread network. Statement 2 is incorrect; they are overseen by the Ministry of Electronics and IT. Statement 4 is incorrect; they primarily serve rural citizens. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in Panchayat Development Plan preparation.
2. It was launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018 by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  It involves only elected representatives at all three Panchayat tiers.
4. The campaign utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The primary aim of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is to significantly increase the involvement of the public in the creation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  This participatory approach ensures that the plans reflect the needs and priorities of the communities they serve.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the initiative was launched in 2018, it was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This is a crucial distinction in understanding the governmental structure and responsibilities related to local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan actively involves not only elected representatives but also frontline government workers, community-based organizations (CBOs) such as Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders. This multi-stakeholder approach fosters a more comprehensive and inclusive planning process.

Statement 4 is correct.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is a key tool used in the campaign to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat, Block Panchayat, and District Panchayat levels. The PDI provides a data-driven assessment that guides the planning process.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. It is the first such center in the world, aiming to set global audit standards.
2. It serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and local government auditors.
3. Its primary focus is on enhancing the independence of central government auditors.
4. It was inaugurated in Mumbai, Maharashtra.

How many of the above statements accurately describe iCAL?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is the first such center in *India*, not the world, aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  The claim of being the first globally is an exaggeration.

Statement 2 is correct. iCAL functions as a collaborative hub, bringing together policymakers and auditors to improve auditing practices and capacity building. This collaborative approach is crucial for effective local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. iCAL focuses on enhancing the independence of *local*, not central, government auditors.  This distinction is vital in understanding its role in promoting accountability at the grassroots level.

Statement 4 is incorrect. iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai, Maharashtra.  The location is a significant detail in understanding its geographical reach and influence.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar Act, 2016, as affirmed by the Supreme Court in 2018:**

1. Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely.
2. The Act violates fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
3. Aadhaar is mandatory for opening bank accounts and mobile connections.
4.  The State can contract with private corporations for Aadhaar data sharing.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act?

(a) None
(b) Only one
(c) Only two
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court explicitly stated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This ruling safeguards individual privacy by limiting the retention of sensitive data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, concluding that it does not violate fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.  The court carefully considered the balance between individual rights and national security interests.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Supreme Court ruled that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but cannot be forcibly imposed for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  This judgment protects citizens' access to essential services without mandatory Aadhaar linkage.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court prohibited the State from entering into contracts with private corporations for the sharing of Aadhaar data, emphasizing the importance of protecting privacy.  This aspect of the judgment underscores the importance of data security and responsible data handling.  Therefore, none of the statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment.


**4. Consider the following regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are funded solely by the central government.
2. They are implemented only through the central government agencies.
3.  The current CSS framework is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers.
4.  Funding for CSSs is routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.

How many of the above statements correctly describe features of Centrally Sponsored Schemes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, reflecting the principle of cooperative federalism.  The funding ratio varies depending on the scheme and the state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSSs are implemented *through* state governments in sectors falling under the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution. This implementation structure emphasizes the decentralized nature of these schemes.

Statement 3 is correct. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  This report played a crucial role in shaping the current structure and functioning of these schemes.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, all transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India. This modification reflects a shift towards greater financial autonomy for states.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2018.
2.  They have jurisdiction only over civil disputes.
3. They are bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
4. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas go to the High Court.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not 2018.  The year is a key detail in understanding the legal basis of these courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases, specifically those involving petty disputes at the village level. Their dual jurisdiction is a crucial aspect of their function.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 but are guided by principles of natural justice. This flexibility allows them to address disputes efficiently in informal settings.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While appeals in civil cases go to the district court, appeals in criminal cases go to the Court of Session.  The appellate structure varies depending on the nature of the case. Therefore, none of the statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the power of the President of India to grant mercy petitions:**

1.  The President can only grant pardons for offences against the law relating to matters under the executive power of the State.
2. The President's power extends to commuting death sentences.
3. The President's power is explicitly mentioned in Article 71 of the Constitution.
4. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not judicially reviewable.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the President's power on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the *Union* extends. The scope of the President's power is not limited to state laws.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to commute death sentences.  This power is a significant aspect of the President's role in the criminal justice system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., is mentioned in Article 72, not Article 71. Article 71 deals with the election of the President.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While the President's decision is generally considered final, there have been instances where courts have intervened in cases involving significant procedural irregularities or violations of fundamental rights. The President's power, while vast, is not absolute. Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. It was primarily based on the recommendations of the Dar Commission.
2. It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.
3. It applies to all states in Northeast India.
4.  It mandates the establishment of a separate legislative assembly for each autonomous district.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was primarily based on the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Dar Commission.  Attributing the recommendations to the wrong committee reflects a lack of precision.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. These councils have significant powers in matters of local governance.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule does not apply to all states in Northeast India. It specifically applies to the areas mentioned above, not all Northeastern states.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does not mandate the establishment of a separate legislative assembly for each autonomous district. The councils have administrative and legislative powers within their respective areas, but they are not independent legislative assemblies. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. They are funded entirely by state governments.
2.  They exclusively handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
3. They were launched as a state-sponsored scheme in 2019.
4.  Their objective is to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features of FTSCs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored* scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.  This funding mechanism is a crucial element in understanding their implementation and reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant number of FTSCs are designated as exclusive POCSO courts, they also handle other rape cases.  The focus is on expeditious disposal of cases under both laws.

Statement 3 is incorrect. FTSCs were launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme, not a state-sponsored scheme.  The central government's role in funding and implementing the scheme is critical.

Statement 4 is correct. The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and those falling under the POCSO Act.  This focus on timely justice is a key feature of the initiative.  Therefore, only one statement is correct.


**9. Consider the following about the Mission Karmayogi:**

1. It exclusively focuses on training contractual employees of the Union Government.
2.  It emphasizes a shift from role-based to rule-based training.
3. It is implemented by the Capacity Building Commission (CBC).
4.  It aims to create a future-ready civil service aligned with India's developmental goals.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Mission Karmayogi?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, *including* contractual employees, across various ministries and agencies of the Union Government.  The comprehensive nature of its coverage is a key feature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi advocates a shift from *rule-based* to *role-based* training and capacity building.  This shift focuses on developing practical skills and competencies rather than rote learning of rules.

Statement 3 is correct.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), launched in 2021, plays a central role in implementing Mission Karmayogi.  The CBC's involvement is crucial in coordinating and overseeing the initiative's implementation.

Statement 4 is correct.  Mission Karmayogi's core objective is to build a professional, well-trained civil service that is capable of addressing India's developmental challenges and achieving its national priorities.  This forward-looking approach is a key element of the initiative.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**10. Consider the following regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Restricted Areas, regardless of their nationality.
3.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as a Restricted Area.
4.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs access to both Protected and Restricted Areas.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the regulations concerning Protected and Restricted Areas in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is partly in a Protected Area and partly in a Restricted Area. The division of the state into these two categories reflects the varying levels of access control.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While foreigners generally require special permits for Restricted Areas, the government *may* exempt certain individuals based on extraordinary reasons.  The provision for exemptions adds a layer of flexibility to the regulations.

Statement 3 is correct. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely declared as a Restricted Area. This designation reflects the sensitivity of the region and the need for tighter access control.

Statement 4 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, indeed governs access to both Protected and Restricted Areas.  This order provides the legal framework for controlling access to these sensitive regions. Therefore, only two statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. They are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, with exemptions for certain states and tribal areas.
2.  They function as mobile courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction, settling petty disputes at the village level.
3.  Their proceedings are bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
4. Appeals from their decisions go to the Court of Session for criminal cases and the district court for civil cases.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the functioning of Gram Nyayalayas?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes these village courts, but it does exempt certain states and tribal areas as specified in the Act.  Statement 2 is also correct.  Gram Nyayalayas are designed to be mobile courts, handling both civil and criminal cases of a petty nature at the village level. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  A crucial aspect of Gram Nyayalayas is that they are *not* strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872; instead, they operate based on the principles of natural justice, allowing for more flexible procedures aimed at efficient dispute resolution.  Statement 4 is correct; the appellate process for Gram Nyayalaya decisions follows the specified path to the Court of Session for criminal matters and the district court for civil cases.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2 and 4) are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following aspects of Contempt of Court in India:**

1. It is exclusively defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, with no other legal basis.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish contempt solely from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.
3. Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt includes actions that scandalize or obstruct the administration of justice.
4. Both civil and criminal contempt are subject to the same penalties and procedures.


Which of the above statements correctly describe aspects of Contempt of Court?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the primary legislation defining contempt, the inherent powers of the judiciary to maintain its authority also play a role. Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution explicitly grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt. Statement 3 accurately distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt, reflecting the core differences in the nature of the offenses. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The penalties and procedures for civil and criminal contempt differ, reflecting the different nature of the offenses.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate.



**3. Consider the following features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign):**

1. It aims to minimize people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  It involves structured Gram Sabhas and other participatory mechanisms at all three tiers of Panchayats.
4. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) plays no role in identifying thematic developmental gaps.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly aims to *maximize* people's participation in PDP preparation. Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the campaign was indeed launched in 2018, it was initiated by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Statement 3 is correct. The campaign uses structured meetings and participatory processes at all three Panchayat levels. Statement 4 is incorrect. The PDI is a key tool used to identify thematic developmental gaps to be addressed in the plans. Therefore, only one statement (3) is fully accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1. Cantonments are exclusively areas dedicated to housing civilian populations.
2.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, independently of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.
3.  The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.
4.  The administration of cantonments falls under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Cantonment Boards?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments house both military and civilian populations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cantonments Act, 2006, operates in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with local self-governance. Statement 3 is correct. The Station Commander holds the ex-officio presidency of the Cantonment Board. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The administrative control of Cantonment Boards rests with the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. Therefore, only one statement (3) is accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues:**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to a healthy environment is not covered under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
2.  The recent Supreme Court judgment on climate change was made in a case concerning the protection of the Asiatic Lion.
3.  The judgment broadened the interpretation of fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 and 21.
4. The Supreme Court's ruling primarily focused on the rights of individuals, excluding broader environmental concerns.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has increasingly recognized the right to a healthy environment as falling under the umbrella of Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life). Statement 2 is incorrect. The judgment was related to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard, not the Asiatic Lion. Statement 3 is correct. The judgment expanded the scope of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns. Statement 4 is incorrect. The ruling had implications beyond individual rights, addressing broader environmental concerns.  Therefore, only one statement (3) is accurate.


**6. Consider the following aspects of Bail in India:**

1.  The principle "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" applies only to bailable offenses under the Indian Penal Code.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The principle "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" has been extended beyond bailable offenses under the IPC, influencing judicial decisions even in cases involving special statutes. Statement 2 is correct. The Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, sets the maximum undertrial detention period at half the maximum sentence. Statement 3 is incorrect.  Plea bargaining is a legally recognized mechanism under certain conditions. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The bar on anticipatory bail under the SC and ST Act is not absolute; it requires a prima facie case to be made out against the accused.  Therefore, only one statement (2) is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA specifically applies to illegal migrants belonging to six minority religious communities from three specified countries. Statement 2 is incorrect.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ADR mechanisms can be used to resolve various types of disputes including commercial, industrial, and family matters. Statement 2 is correct. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is indeed based on the UNCITRAL Model Law and has undergone several amendments. Statement 3 is incorrect.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) aims to enhance public participation in creating Panchayat Development Plans.  Statement 4 is also accurate; the finalized Gram Panchayat Development Plans are indeed published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Jan Yojana Abhiyan was initially launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas". Statement 3 is also false because the campaign involves a broader range of stakeholders, including community-based organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs) and other relevant parties.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  iCAL aims to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance. However, statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is situated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad. Statement 3 is also false; while iCAL provides capacity building, it's not limited to the private sector and includes policymakers and auditors from various sectors.  Finally, statement 4 is inaccurate; iCAL functions independently and isn't directly under the CAG's authority.  Thus, only one statement is correct.

(d) All four

Statement 2 is correct.  Aadhaar's unique 12-digit number is indeed linked to individual biometric data. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar confirms identity, not citizenship or domicile. Statement 3 is false; Aadhaar data is stored centrally, not decentrally.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate; the Supreme Court's ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it's not compulsory for all financial transactions or activities like opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

However, statement 1 is incorrect; the MCC was first implemented in 1960 during Kerala state assembly elections, not 1970 during Lok Sabha elections. Statement 3 is also false; the MCC governs the conduct of both political parties and candidates.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?
(a) Only one

(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 and 4 are partially correct. The Sevottam model does indeed include modules on Citizen's Charters and Capability Building.  However, while the District Magistrate frequently serves as the District Public Grievance Officer, it's not universally true across all states; some states utilize alternative grievance mechanisms.  Statement 1 is incorrect;  the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, also handles grievances.  Statement 2 is also false; CPGRAMS is an online platform, not offline.  Therefore, only two statements are partially or completely correct.


**7. Consider the following aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 4 are correct. The current CSS framework is based on the 2015 report, and all funding is routed via the Consolidated Fund of the State. However, statement 1 is incorrect; CSSs involve joint funding from the central and state governments. Statement 3 is also false; CSSs are designed to support schemes integral to the National Development Agenda.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.

(d) All four

**Explanation:**

The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) has several key functions as per the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.  Statement 1 is correct: The DPBI can indeed impose penalties for non-compliance. Statement 2 is also correct: Appeals against DPBI decisions lie with TDSAT. Statement 3 is accurate; the DPBI directs data fiduciaries on handling data breaches. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The DPBI board members' term is two years, not three, with eligibility for reappointment. Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The inclusion of a potentially misleading term length in the options serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the DPBI's structure.

How many of these statements accurately reflect provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Telecommunications Act, 2023, introduced significant changes in the telecom sector. Statement 1 is incorrect; spectrum allocation for national security is done administratively, not through auction.  Statement 2 is correct; the older acts are repealed. Statement 3 is incorrect; RoW is granted non-discriminatorily. Statement 4 is correct; the fund is renamed. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately reflect the Act's provisions. This question tests the candidate's understanding of the Act’s specific provisions, using partially correct statements to create plausible distractors.

Statement 2 is incorrect; the Supreme Court mandated a six-month limit on Aadhaar metadata storage. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Supreme Court upheld the Aadhaar Act's constitutionality with certain conditions.  Statement 4 is correct; the architecture is indeed scalable. Option (a) correctly identifies the three incorrect statements, creating a challenging question by presenting a mix of correct and incorrect statements related to a complex subject matter.

**Explanation:**

Mission Karmayogi aims to reform civil service capacity building. Statement 1 is incorrect; it covers all civil servants, not just IAS officers. Statement 2 is correct; it promotes a shift to role-based training. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the CBC plays a key role, other agencies are involved. Statement 4 is correct; it emphasizes a competency-driven approach.  Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate statements, making it a difficult question because it tests knowledge of the program's scope and implementation details, using strategically placed distractors.

Statement 2 is incorrect; they are under the Ministry of Defence, not Home Affairs. Statement 3 is correct; the Station Commander is the ex-officio President. Statement 4 is incorrect; the first cantonments were established by the East India Company.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's Fiscal Federalism:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states.
2.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines tax bases between the Union and States.
3.  Article 275 of the Constitution deals with the Union's power to borrow money abroad.
4.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based on criteria like income distance and population.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution clearly delineates the tax bases between the Union and the States (Article 246).  Statement 4 is accurate; Horizontal devolution involves distributing funds among states based on several criteria, including income distance and population (as per the 15th FC's recommendations). However, Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid from the Union to states, not the Union's power to borrow money (that is covered under Article 292, which permits borrowing within or outside the country).  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to allocate grants to SCS states.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does *not* contain any provision for categorizing states as SCS. It's a classification developed post-independence based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions. Statement 2 is correct; the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for grant allocation to SCS states. Statement 3 is incorrect; the 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of SCS, leading to its eventual phasing out. Statement 4 is correct; Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have indeed recently demanded special financial packages (though not explicitly SCS).  Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are incorrect.


**3. Consider the following provisions related to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA):**

1.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) implements the FCRA, with support from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).

3.  The validity of FCRA registration is ten years.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The MHA implements the FCRA, but it is the Intelligence Bureau, not the CBI, that assists in approvals and rejections through investigations. Statement 2 is incorrect; the designated FCRA account must be in specified branches of the State Bank of India in New Delhi, not any branch. Statement 3 is incorrect; the validity of FCRA registration is five years, not ten. Statement 4 is correct; post-2020 amendments indeed reduced the permissible use of foreign funds for administrative expenses to 20% (from 50%).  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the 2023 Act does repeal the 1998 Act. Statement 2 is also correct; the DGPS heads India Post and has powers to make regulations, including on charges for services. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act does not prescribe penal provisions. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the grounds for interception are broader than just national security threats, including public order and public safety. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is a designated nodal agency for handling grievances.

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; DARPG is a designated nodal agency. Statement 2 is incorrect; CPGRAMS is an *online* platform. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Sevottam model encompasses Citizen's Charters and capability building for service delivery, not just grievance redressal. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the District Magistrate is often designated as the District Public Grievance Officer, it's not always the case.  Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.

1.  It resulted from the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2.  It applies to all the Northeastern states.
3.  It deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states.
4.  It provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule resulted from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Nehru Committee. Statement 2 is incorrect; it applies to specific tribal areas within certain states, not all Northeastern states. Statement 3 is correct; it deals with the administration of tribal areas. Statement 4 is correct; it provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


**7. Consider the following concerning the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional body. Statement 2 is incorrect; its headquarters are in New Delhi. Statement 3 is correct; it was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. Statement 4 is partially correct; while the NHRC has *had* GANHRI accreditation in the past, its current status is subject to review and may be deferred.  Therefore, only statement 3 (and arguably a nuanced version of 4) is correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding the auditing of local bodies in India:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) is responsible for auditing all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
2.  The Ministry of Panchayati Raj developed the AuditOnline application for online auditing of urban local body accounts.

4.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts deal with local self-governance.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the CAG audits all three levels of PRIs. Statement 2 is incorrect; AuditOnline is for auditing *panchayat* accounts, not urban local body accounts. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ELFA works under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG. Statement 4 is correct; these amendments deal with local self-governance. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.

4.  The RTI Act's provisions apply to all private organizations.


Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the RTI Act replaced the 2002 Act. Statement 2 is correct; DoPT under MoPPG&P is the coordinating agency. Statement 3 is largely correct, although the Supreme Court's interpretation links RTI to Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression), not explicitly declaring it a fundamental right in the same way other fundamental rights are enshrined.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the RTI Act's provisions apply to *public* authorities, not all private organizations. Therefore, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect (though 3 is debatable based on interpretation).


**10. Consider the following statements about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. It aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. It was launched as 'Sabki Yojana, Sabka Vikas' in 2018 by the Ministry of Rural Development.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to enhance participation in PDP preparation. Statement 2 is partially incorrect;  it was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. Statement 3 is correct; the PDI is used to identify gaps. Statement 4 is correct; approved GPDPs are published on the portal.  Therefore, three statements are correct.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in India:**

1. The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was established by the Supreme Court of India in 2005.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is applicable only to commercial disputes.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The MCPC was indeed established by the Supreme Court in 2005 to oversee the effective implementation of mediation and conciliation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, applies to all kinds of arbitrations, not just commercial disputes.  Its scope is broader than just commercial matters.

Statement 3 is correct. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, was specifically designed to facilitate institutional arbitration in India, providing a more structured and efficient framework for resolving disputes.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) is an intergovernmental organization established by the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes in 1899.  It handles international commercial and investment arbitrations, among other types of international disputes.  It is not a domestic body.


**2. Consider the following features related to India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  Taxes levied and collected by the union and distributed between the union and states are based solely on the population of each state.
2. Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among different states.
3. Grants-in-aid are provided to states as per Article 275 of the Constitution.
4. State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's fiscal federalism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While population is a factor considered in the distribution of resources, it's not the sole criterion.  The distribution of revenue between the union and states involves multiple factors as recommended by the Finance Commission, including income distance, area, demographic performance, and others.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the States. Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of resources *among* the states.

Statement 3 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution explicitly provides for the central government to make grants-in-aid to states that are in need of special financial assistance.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Article 293 explicitly states that state governments can borrow only *within* India, not outside.  Borrowing from international sources requires the consent of the Union government.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1. SCS is constitutionally mandated for states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula determined grants for SCS states.
3. The 14th Finance Commission introduced the concept of SCS.
4.  Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J provide special provisions to certain states, irrespective of SCS status.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the Special Category Status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly mention or provide for a Special Category Status. The granting of SCS has been based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions and other government decisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed used to determine grants given to states with Special Category Status.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The concept of SCS existed before the 14th Finance Commission.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS classification.

Statement 4 is correct.  The articles mentioned provide a range of special provisions to several states, regardless of whether they were officially designated as having Special Category Status.  These provisions address specific regional needs and circumstances.


**4. Consider the following provisions of the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), post-2020 amendments:**

1.  NGOs are required to submit Aadhaar details of every office bearer for registration.

3.  NGOs must maintain a designated FCRA account in any branch of State Bank of India.
4.  The validity of FCRA registration is for 10 years.

How many of the above statements are accurate reflections of the FCRA's provisions after the 2020 amendments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate Aadhaar submission for every office bearer of registered NGOs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The maximum permissible use of foreign funds for administrative expenses was reduced to 20%, not 50%, after the 2020 amendments.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  A designated FCRA account is mandatory, but it must be in a designated branch of State Bank of India in New Delhi, not any branch.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The validity of FCRA registration is five years, not ten years, and renewal must be applied for within six months of expiry.


**5. Consider the following features of the Post Office Act, 2023:**

1. The Act introduces a new position of Director-General of Postal Services (DGPS) to head India Post.
2. The Act grants the government unlimited power to intercept postal articles without any justification.
3. The Act prescribes extensive penal provisions for violations.
4. The Act repeals the India Post Office Act, 1914.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Post Office Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, does indeed establish the position of Director-General of Postal Services (DGPS) to head India Post.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act allows for the interception of postal articles under specific grounds (security of the state, public order, etc.), it does not grant unlimited power to do so without justification.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Act notably *lacks* extensive penal provisions.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Act repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998, not the 1914 Act.


**6. Consider the following statements about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Constitution.

2. The campaign was launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas'.
3. The campaign involves only elected representatives in the preparation of PDPs.
4. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is not used in the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly aims to *increase* people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Chennai.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core objective of iCAL is to establish global standards for the auditing of local governance bodies.

Statement 3 is incorrect. iCAL specifically targets local governance bodies, not national-level ones.

Statement 4 is correct. iCAL functions as a collaborative platform bringing together policymakers and auditors to improve the auditing of local governance.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule is primarily concerned with the administration of Union Territories.
3. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states.
4. The Sixth Schedule is contained in Part XII of the Constitution.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Sixth Schedule?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was indeed a direct result of the recommendations made by the Bardoloi Committee.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, not Union Territories.

Statement 3 is correct.  A key feature of the Sixth Schedule is the establishment of autonomous district councils within the specified states to provide greater self-governance to tribal communities.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule is found in Part X of the Constitution, not Part XII.


**10. Consider the following statements related to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The RTI Act provides access to information under the control of public authorities, not all information held by individuals.  There are exemptions and limitations to the right to information.

Statement 4 is partially correct. While the Supreme Court played a role in recognizing the importance of access to information, it did not explicitly declare it a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a). The court recognized the importance of transparency and access to information as related to Articles 19 and 21.


**1. Consider the following statements related to the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, suspend, remit, or commute sentences.
2.  This power extends to sentences by court-martial and offenses against laws under the Union's executive power.
3.  The President's power includes the commutation of death sentences.
4.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions regarding the President's power on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the President's power under Article 72.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the authority to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences passed by courts-martial or for offenses against laws under the Union's executive power. This includes the power to commute a death sentence. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can review the process leading to the President's decision, it cannot directly overturn the President's decision on a mercy petition. The President's decision is considered a discretionary power and not subject to judicial review in the same way as other government actions.  The Supreme Court's role is limited to ensuring due process and fairness in the process leading up to the President's decision.


**2. Consider the following regarding curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India:**

1.  A curative petition is the last constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed.
2.  The power for curative petitions stems from the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice.
3.  A curative petition can be filed only if there's a violation of natural justice principles or evidence of judicial bias.
4.  The grounds for a curative petition are explicitly listed in the Constitution of India.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding curative petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition's dismissal. The Supreme Court's power to grant curative petitions is derived from Article 142, allowing it to ensure complete justice.  The grounds for a curative petition typically involve violations of natural justice (like a judge's undisclosed conflict of interest), or instances where a judgment demonstrates apparent bias significantly affecting the petitioner. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The grounds are not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution; rather, they've evolved through Supreme Court precedents.  The Court has established certain criteria, but there isn't a rigid, exhaustive list in the Constitution itself.


**3. Consider the following features of Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme primarily focused on sexual assault cases.
2.  Funding for FTSCs is entirely sourced from the Nirbhaya Fund.
3.  The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, oversees the implementation of FTSCs.
4.  FTSCs aim to expedite the disposal of cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases.
5.  All 1023 planned FTSCs are currently operational across India.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding FTSCs?

(a) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. FTSCs are indeed a centrally sponsored scheme concentrating on cases of sexual assault, including those under the POCSO Act.  The Department of Justice handles their implementation.  Their primary aim is to ensure swift justice in these cases. However, statement 2 is partially incorrect; while the Nirbhaya Fund is a significant source of funding, it's not the exclusive source. Statement 5 is incorrect; the total number of planned FTSCs is 1023, but not all are operational.  The actual number functioning is less than the planned number.  This discrepancy highlights the challenges in implementing such schemes effectively.


**4. Consider the following aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign):**

1.  It aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  It was launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018 by the Ministry of Rural Development.
3.  The campaign involves all three tiers of Panchayats, including elected representatives and community organizations.
4.  The campaign utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.
5.  The approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

How many of these statements correctly describe the Jan Yojana Abhiyan?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 accurately reflect the key features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan. The campaign emphasizes people's participation in PDP preparation, involves all Panchayat tiers and stakeholders, uses PDI to identify gaps, and publishes approved plans on the e-Gram Swaraj portal. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development, launched the campaign under the name ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’. This subtle difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding government initiatives.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Anti-Defection Law (ADL):**

1.  The ADL was introduced through the 52nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1985.
2.  The presiding officer of the House decides on disqualification under the ADL.
3.  The ADL allows for mergers of political parties if two-thirds of legislators agree.
4.  The ADL mandates a specific timeframe for the presiding officer to decide on anti-defection cases.
5.  The ADL applies equally to nominated members and elected members from the moment they take their seats.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the ADL?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3, and 5
(c) 1, 2, and 3, and 4
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe aspects of the ADL.  The law was indeed introduced via the 52nd Amendment, the presiding officer decides on disqualifications, and party mergers are permitted under certain conditions. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the ADL doesn't specify a timeframe for decisions on anti-defection cases, leading to delays. Statement 5 is also incorrect, as nominated members are subject to different rules regarding party affiliation than elected members.  Nominated members face disqualification only after six months of taking their seat.


**6. Consider the following concerning Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems:**

1.  PR aims to allocate seats proportionally to the votes received by parties.
2.  PR is currently used for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections in India.
3.  PR systems can lead to coalition governments more frequently than First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) systems.
4.  PR systems always result in greater political stability than FPTP systems.
5.  A major advantage of PR is that it reduces wasted votes compared to FPTP.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of PR electoral systems?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 5 are correct. Proportional representation does aim for proportional seat allocation based on votes received.  It typically leads to more coalition governments because no single party often wins a majority.  It also minimizes wasted votes, unlike FPTP where votes for losing candidates are effectively wasted. However, statement 2 is incorrect; India currently uses FPTP, not PR, for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while PR can sometimes lead to greater representation of diverse viewpoints, it doesn't automatically guarantee greater political stability. Coalitions can be unstable.


**7. Consider the following regarding the issuance of passports in India:**

1.  The Central Government has the sole authority to issue passports to Indian citizens.
2.  The Central Government can issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest.
3.  There are only two types of passports issued in India: ordinary and diplomatic.
4.  Possession of a passport is mandatory for all Indian citizens who wish to travel internationally.


How many of the above statements correctly describe passport issuance in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Central Government holds the primary authority to issue passports to Indian citizens. It also has the power to issue passports to non-citizens if deemed necessary in the public interest. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  There are three types of passports issued in India: ordinary, diplomatic, and official. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while a passport is generally required for international travel, the Central Government may exempt certain individuals from this requirement.


**8. Consider the following about the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme:**

1.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development.
2.  CSCs form one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
3.  CSCs primarily serve urban citizens by providing access to government services.
4.  CSCs offer only government-to-citizen (G2C) services.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the CSC scheme?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. CSCs are indeed one of the three pillars of the NeGP, along with connectivity and national data infrastructure.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the CSC SPV is overseen by the Ministry of Electronics and IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Statement 3 is incorrect; CSCs primarily serve rural citizens, although they increasingly reach urban areas as well. Statement 4 is also incorrect; CSCs offer a range of services, including G2C, business-to-consumer (B2C), and financial services.


**9. Consider the following regarding the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI):**

1.  The WPFI is published annually by the United Nations.
2.  India consistently ranks among the top 50 countries in the WPFI.
3.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is responsible for publishing the WPFI.
4.  The WPFI assesses press freedom across various countries globally.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the WPFI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  The WPFI is indeed published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading NGO focused on press freedom.  The index evaluates press freedom levels in countries worldwide. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the WPFI is not published by the United Nations. Statement 2 is also incorrect; India's ranking in the WPFI is not consistently among the top 50; it has fluctuated significantly over the years and frequently occupies a position far lower down the list.


**10. Consider the following about the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

1.  It aims solely to protect the data of Indian citizens.
2.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data protection.
3.  The Act gives data principals the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.
4.  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Supreme Court of India.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the provisions of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act does establish the DPBI to regulate data protection. It grants data principals rights including the right to correction and erasure.  Appeals against DPBI decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while the Act primarily focuses on data within India, its reach extends to data processing involving Indian citizens even if it occurs outside India.  The Act does not only protect the data of Indian citizens.  It also considers cases of cross-border data transfer and processing.



1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against any law relating to a matter within the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President's power extends to death sentences imposed by court-martials.
3.  The President's mercy power is absolute and not subject to judicial review.
4.  The President can only consider mercy petitions after all appeals have been exhausted.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions related to the President's power on mercy petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes death sentences.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the President's power is significant, it is not absolute.  The Supreme Court has held that the President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review on limited grounds, such as if the process was vitiated by procedural impropriety or if the decision was arbitrary or capricious.

Statement 4 is also incorrect.  While typically mercy petitions are filed after all appeals have been exhausted, there is no strict constitutional mandate requiring this.  The President has the discretion to consider a petition at any stage.



2. Consider the following regarding a curative petition in the Supreme Court of India:

1.  It is the final remedy available after the dismissal of a review petition.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the characteristics and procedures related to curative petitions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While consistency in judgments is a desirable goal, curative petitions are not solely based on this principle. They are granted in exceptional cases where there has been a miscarriage of justice, potentially due to a violation of natural justice, non-disclosure of material facts by the judge, or other significant errors.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  A violation of principles of natural justice is a *ground* for filing a curative petition, but it's not the only one.  Other grounds include demonstrable errors in the judgment or the presence of significant new evidence.

Statement 4 is correct. The Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142, which allows it to do complete justice, is the source of its authority to entertain curative petitions.  This power is exercised sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.  While states may contribute, they are not the sole funders.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant number of FTSCs are dedicated to POCSO cases (ePOCSO courts), they also handle other rape cases.  Their jurisdiction is not exclusively limited to POCSO.

Statement 3 is correct. The Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for the implementation of the FTSC scheme.

(b) Only two

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution.
2.  This power extends to cases where the sentence is given by a court-martial.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute sentences.  Statement 2 is also correct; the President's power extends to sentences awarded by court-martials. Statement 3 is partially correct. While the President's power extends to offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union, it's not limited to only these cases. It also includes cases of death sentences irrespective of the nature of the offense.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The President's power under Article 72 does extend to death sentences and, importantly, also to sentences of life imprisonment.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The inclusion of life imprisonment as an exception in statement 4 acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of Article 72's scope.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition is rejected, the *Rupa Ashok Hurra* case established this process, and a violation of natural justice is a valid ground for filing one. However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's curative power stems from Article 142, which empowers it to do complete justice, not Article 141 (which deals with the Supreme Court's judgments being binding on all courts). The subtle difference between Articles 141 and 142 is a key distractor designed to test deep understanding of constitutional provisions.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. FTSCs were launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme, their funding comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, and their main goal is swift justice in rape and POCSO cases.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The implementing ministry is the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This discrepancy in the implementing ministry serves as a significant distractor, requiring precise knowledge of the administrative structure.


**4. Consider the following provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1973:**

1.  It mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable by imprisonment of at least five years.
2.  It empowers a Magistrate to order the provision of specimen signatures and handwriting samples.
3.  It prescribes detailed timelines for the submission of medical reports to the investigating officer.
4.  The CrPC 1973 was enacted based on the recommendations of the 40th Law Commission of India report.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The CrPC 1973 does grant Magistrates the power to order specimen samples and sets timelines for procedures like submitting medical reports.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the threshold for mandatory forensic investigation is at least seven years, not five. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it was the 41st, not the 40th, Law Commission report that significantly influenced the CrPC 1973.  The slight numerical variations in statements 1 and 4 create strong distractors, testing the candidate's precise recall of details.


**5.  Consider the following provisions of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023:**

1.  It replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
2.  It allows for the admissibility of electronic records as evidence with the same legal standing as paper records.

4. It permits joint trials only when all accused are present in court.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The 2023 Act replaces the 1872 Act and grants electronic records equal legal weight. Statement 3 is incorrect; while it allows for electronic submission of oral evidence, it doesn't mandate it exclusively; in-person testimony remains an option. Statement 4 is also incorrect; joint trials are permitted even if some accused are absconding.  The contrast between the actual provisions and the slightly altered statements in options 3 and 4 makes this question challenging.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

1. It applies only to the processing of digital personal data within India.
2.  It requires consent for processing personal data, except in specified legitimate uses.
3.  It establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) with appellate jurisdiction to TDSAT.
4.  It exempts personal data processed for national security purposes from most of its provisions.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Act does have exceptions to consent requirements, establishes the DPBI with appeals to TDSAT, and provides exemptions for national security.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act also applies to data processed outside India if it relates to goods or services offered in India.  The seemingly straightforward nature of statement 1, contrasted with its inaccuracy, makes it a potent distractor.


**7. Consider the following about the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  Its headquarters are located in Mumbai.
3.  It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
4. The GANHRI accreditation of NHRCI was deferred in 2023 due to concerns about staff diversity and protection of marginalized groups.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the 1993 Act, and its GANHRI accreditation was indeed deferred in 2023 due to the mentioned reasons. Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory, not a constitutional body. Statement 2 is also incorrect; its headquarters are in New Delhi, not Mumbai. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect locations and the nature of the body itself creates effective distractors.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1.  It aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  It was launched as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ in 2018.
3.  It involves only elected representatives at the Gram Panchayat level.
4.  The approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Abhiyan aims for increased public participation in PDPs, was launched under the given name in 2018, and utilizes the e-Gram Swaraj portal for publication. Statement 3 is incorrect; it involves all three tiers of Panchayats and various other stakeholders besides just elected representatives. The limitation of participation to only one level of governance in statement 3 acts as a crucial distractor.


**9. Consider the following regarding the auditing of local bodies:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 mandate the auditing of local bodies.
2.  The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies is derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.
3.  The AuditOnline application is used for online auditing of urban local bodies only.
4.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) was inaugurated in Mumbai.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Constitutional Amendments provide the framework, and the 1971 Act outlines the CAG's role. Statement 3 is incorrect; AuditOnline is used for both urban and rural local bodies. Statement 4 is also incorrect; iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Mumbai.  The incorrect locations and the scope of the AuditOnline application are designed to challenge the examinee.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Right to Information Act, 2005:**

1.  The Office of the Chief Justice of India is considered a Public Authority under the RTI Act.
2.  Section 8 of the RTI Act exempts all personal information from disclosure.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court has indeed declared the CJI's office a Public Authority. Statement 2 is incorrect; Section 8 has exemptions, but not a blanket exemption for all personal information (the DPDP Act 2023 modified this). Statement 3 is incorrect; lower courts are generally barred, though the higher courts retain jurisdiction. Statement 4 is incorrect; the timeframe is generally 30 days, though exceptions exist for urgent matters. The blend of correct and slightly altered information makes this a difficult question.


**11. Consider the following features of Aadhaar:**

1.  Aadhaar is a 16-digit unique identification number.
2.  It is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
3.  It can be deactivated or blocked only by the individual who holds the Aadhaar card.
4.  The Supreme Court has ruled that Aadhaar is definitive proof of date of birth.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. UIDAI issues Aadhaar, and deactivation/blocking can be initiated by the cardholder or UIDAI. Statement 1 is incorrect; Aadhaar is a 12-digit number, not 16. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Supreme Court has clarified that Aadhaar isn't definitive proof of date of birth.  The numerical discrepancy in statement 1 and the precise legal position regarding date of birth in statement 4 are key distractors.


**12. Consider the following concerning Indian Passports:**

1.  Possession of an Indian passport is mandatory for all Indian citizens traveling abroad.
2.  The Central Government can issue passports to non-Indian citizens in certain circumstances.
3.  India issues only two types of passports: Ordinary and Diplomatic.
4.  The color of the Ordinary Passport is White.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are partially correct. The government can issue passports to non-citizens in specific cases, and there are more than two types of passports issued (Ordinary, Diplomatic, and Official). Statement 1 is incorrect;  exceptions exist for specific situations. Statement 4 is incorrect; the colour of the Ordinary Passport is Blue. The subtle differences between the actual and stated facts make this question challenging.


**13. Consider the following about Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

1.  CSC SPV was set up under the IT Act, 2000.
2.  CSCs are a key component of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
3.  CSCs primarily cater to urban citizens.
4.  CSCs offer only government-to-citizen (G2C) services.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. CSCs are indeed a crucial part of the NeGP. Statement 1 is incorrect; CSC SPV was set up under the Companies Act, 1956, not the IT Act, 2000. Statement 3 is incorrect; CSCs primarily serve rural areas. Statement 4 is incorrect; they offer G2C, B2C, and other services. The incorrect acts and the target audience create strong distractors.


**14. Consider the following regarding the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024:**

1.  The WPFI 2024 was released by the United Nations.
2.  India's ranking improved in the WPFI 2024 compared to the previous year.
3.  The WPFI is an annual ranking of countries based on press freedom.
4.  Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is a United States-based organization.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The WPFI is indeed an annual ranking on press freedom. Statement 1 is incorrect; it's released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not the UN. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's ranking worsened. Statement 4 is incorrect; RSF is based in Paris, not the US. The inaccurate details regarding the releasing body, ranking trend and location of RSF create strong distractors.


**15. Consider the following concerning the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF):**

1.  The RTBF originates from the "right to privacy" in French jurisprudence.
2.  The RTBF is an absolute right in India.
3.  The Supreme Court of India has recognized the RTBF as part of the right to life under Article 21.
4.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 explicitly incorporates the RTBF.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are partially correct. The Supreme Court has recognized RTBF as linked to Article 21, and it does originate from a related right in French jurisprudence ("right to oblivion"). However, statement 1 is inaccurate in its description of the origin. Statement 2 is incorrect; the RTBF is not absolute. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the 2023 Act doesn't explicitly mention it.  The subtle inaccuracies and the absence of explicit mention in the 2023 Act create strong distractors.


**16. Consider the following regarding Inner Line Permits (ILPs):**

1.  ILPs are issued to all Indian citizens wishing to enter protected areas.
2.  The ILP system is primarily aimed at regulating movement near India's international borders.
3.  The ILP system originated with the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873.
4.  NRIs are eligible for ILPs.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. ILPs are used for border control and originated in 1873. Statement 1 is incorrect; they are not issued to all citizens, only those with permission to enter protected areas. Statement 4 is also incorrect; NRIs are not eligible for ILPs. The limited applicability of ILPs and the eligibility criteria create strong distractors.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1. Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company.
2. The administration of cantonments falls under the purview of the Union Government.
3. Cantonment Boards are responsible for civic duties such as providing primary education and water supply.
4. The Station Commander of a cantonment serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.
5.  All cantonments in India were established before India's independence.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Cantonments originated with the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey.  Statement 2 is correct: The local self-government of cantonments is a Union subject (Entry 3 of the Union List). Statement 3 is correct: Cantonment Boards perform various civic functions, including providing public health services, water supply, and primary education.  Statement 4 is correct: The Station Commander holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. Statement 5 is incorrect: While most cantonments were established before independence, six were established after. Therefore, only four statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from adverse climate change effects to Article 32 of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court’s judgment in 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' focused solely on the protection of the Great Indian Bustard.
3. The judgment expanded the interpretation of Article 14 to include environmental rights.
4. Article 21, the right to life, has been consistently interpreted narrowly by the Supreme Court in environmental cases.
5. The judgment explicitly invoked Article 19 in relation to environmental rights.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the judgment linked the right to be free from adverse climate change effects to Articles 14 and 21, not Article 32. Statement 2 is partially correct; the case did involve the Great Indian Bustard, but it also had broader implications for environmental rights. Statement 3 is correct: The court broadened the scope of Article 14 (right to equality) to encompass environmental rights. Statement 4 is incorrect:  The Supreme Court has increasingly used Article 21 (right to life) to uphold environmental rights. Statement 5 is incorrect: While the judgment focused on Articles 14 and 21, it did not explicitly invoke Article 19.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following aspects of India’s Fiscal Federalism:**

5. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 50% share for states from the divisible pool.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the *Union*, not the states. Statement 2 is incorrect; vertical devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool of the *Union*, not the distribution among states. Statement 3 is correct: Article 275 deals with grants-in-aid. Statement 4 is incorrect; state governments need Union consent to borrow from foreign sources (Article 293). Statement 5 is incorrect; the 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share, not 50%. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants for SCS states.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS system.
4.  The demand for SCS is currently being made by only Bihar.
5. SCS is a classification given by the Centre to assist in the development of states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Constitution does not contain a provision for SCS. Statement 2 is correct: The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used for grants to SCS states. Statement 3 is incorrect: The 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS system. Statement 4 is incorrect:  Both Bihar and Andhra Pradesh have demanded SCS.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; it was the Bardoloi Committee, not the Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Committee. Statement 2 is incorrect; ADCs have a maximum of 30 members. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Sixth Schedule applies only to certain tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Statement 4 is correct: ADCs and ARCs have legislative powers over several subjects, including forest management and agriculture. Statement 5 is incorrect; the PESA Act applies to Fifth Schedule areas, not Sixth Schedule areas. Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following about the formation of new states in India:**

1.  The President's recommendation is not required for introducing a bill in Parliament regarding the formation of new states.
2.  State legislatures must be consulted before a bill affecting a state's boundaries is recommended by the President.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the President's recommendation is necessary. Statement 2 is correct:  Consultation with state legislatures is mandated before presidential recommendation. Statement 3 is incorrect; the state government, not Parliament, has this power. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Dhar Commission prioritized administrative convenience, not linguistic factors. Statement 5 is correct; this was the recommendation of the Fazl Ali Commission. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional one. Statement 2 is correct: The President appoints the Chairperson. Statement 3 is correct: The NHRC possesses powers similar to a civil court. Statement 4 is incorrect; the tenure is three years or until age 70. Statement 5 is incorrect; the NHRC's definition explicitly includes these rights. Therefore, only three statements are correct.

1. The RTI Act, 2005 replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of resources between the Union and States.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based on various criteria.
3.  Article 293 allows state governments to borrow money from foreign sources.
4.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission to make recommendations on the distribution of revenue between the Union and the States.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool allocated to states from the center. Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based on various criteria. Statement 3 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing from foreign sources; they can only borrow within India.  Statement 4 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states that are in need of special financial assistance.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are correct.


2. Consider the following features related to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India:

1.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  SCS states used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
3.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS.
4.  The Fifth Finance Commission first introduced the SCS.


Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the SCS?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not contain any explicit provision for granting Special Category Status to states.  Statement 2 is correct.  SCS states historically received central grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, a specific allocation mechanism.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 14th Finance Commission, in fact, recommended the discontinuation of the SCS, leading to its eventual phasing out. Statement 4 is correct. The Fifth Finance Commission is credited with the initial introduction of the SCS concept in 1969. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


3. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:

1.  It resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  It empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) only.
3.  ADCs have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management and agriculture.
4.  The Sixth Schedule applies to certain Scheduled Areas declared by the President.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the Sixth Schedule?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, enshrined under Article 244(2), is a direct outcome of the recommendations made by the Bardoloi Committee.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to create both Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).  Statement 3 is correct. ADCs possess the authority to legislate on matters such as forest management, agriculture, and other specified subjects related to tribal communities. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule deals with Scheduled Areas declared by the President; the Sixth Schedule applies specifically to the tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


4. Consider the following aspects of Centre-State relations in India:

1.  The Seventh Schedule defines the tax bases between the Union and States.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union but wholly assigned to States are defined under Article 268.
3.  The GST Council's recommendations determine the distribution of GST revenue.
4.  The Union government can borrow money both within and outside India under Article 292.


Which of these statements accurately reflect the constitutional provisions governing Centre-State financial relations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of powers, including taxation powers, between the Union and the States under Article 246. Statement 2 is correct.  Article 268 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States.  Statement 3 is correct. The GST Council, a constitutional body, plays a crucial role in determining the distribution of GST revenue between the Union and the States. Statement 4 is incorrect. While Article 292 grants the Union government the power to borrow money, it is restricted to borrowing within India only. Borrowing from outside India requires specific legislative provisions. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.


5. Consider the following regarding the status of state finances in India:

1.  States fund over 60% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources.
2.  The debt-GDP ratio of states is below 20% as of March 2023.
3.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share for states from the divisible pool.
4.  Horizontal devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the States.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the financial position of Indian states?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 2 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. States currently fund only about 58% of their revenue expenditure from their own sources. Statement 2 is incorrect. The debt-GDP ratio of states stood at 27.5% in March 2023, significantly higher than 20%. Statement 3 is correct.  The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share for states from the divisible pool of central taxes. Statement 4 is incorrect.  Horizontal devolution is the distribution of funds *among* states, not between the Union and States (that's vertical devolution).  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


6. Consider the following about the  constitutional provisions related to borrowing by the Union and State Governments:

1. Article 292 allows the Union Government to borrow money both within and outside India.
2. Article 293 allows State Governments to borrow money from foreign sources.
3. If a State is indebted to the Union, it requires the Union's prior consent for further borrowing.
4. The Finance Commission adjudicates the sharing of resources between the Union and States under Article 280.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 292 permits the Union Government to borrow only *within* India.  Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 similarly restricts State Governments to borrowing *within* India. Statement 3 is correct.  If a State owes money to the Union, it cannot take on further debt without the Union's prior approval.  Statement 4 is correct. Article 280 establishes the Finance Commission's role in determining the revenue sharing between the Union and States. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.


7. Consider the following regarding the  provisions related to discretionary grants in the Indian Constitution:

1. Special Packages to states are provided under Article 275.
2. Article 282 empowers both the Centre and States to make grants for any public purpose.
3. Special Packages are always need-based and the need is the proximate reason for granting them.
4. The need for Special Packages is decided by the Finance Commission.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the constitutional basis of discretionary grants?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Special Packages are additional grants provided under Article 282, not Article 275 (which covers grants-in-aid).  Statement 2 is correct. Article 282 gives the Centre and States the power to make grants for any public purpose, irrespective of their legislative competence.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While Special Packages often address socio-economic challenges, they are discretionary and not solely determined by need.  Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Finance Commission doesn't directly decide on Special Packages; they are a matter of government discretion. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


8. Consider the following statements concerning the Protected and Restricted Areas in India as defined under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963:

1.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Restricted Area.
2.  A foreigner needs a special permit to enter a Protected Area, except citizens of Bhutan.
3.  The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are partially declared as a Protected Area.
4.  The Central Government can exempt certain individuals from needing a passport to enter these areas.


Which of the statements correctly reflect the regulations governing access to Protected and Restricted Areas in India?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is partly in a Protected Area and partly in a Restricted Area. Statement 2 is correct.  Foreigners (except Bhutanese citizens) require special permits to enter Protected or Restricted Areas. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area.  Statement 4 is correct. The Central Government has the authority to exempt specific individuals from passport requirements for entry into these areas.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately describe the regulations.


9. Consider the following regarding the formation of new states in India under Article 3:

1. The President's recommendation is required for introducing a bill for the formation of a new state.
2. Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of two or more existing states.
3.  A state's area, boundaries, or name can only be altered with the consent of the state legislature.
4.  The process of state formation is solely determined by the Supreme Court of India.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the process of forming new states in India as per Article 3?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 3 mandates the President's recommendation for introducing a bill related to the creation of a new state. Statement 2 is correct. Parliament has the power to create new states by combining parts of existing ones or by separating territory from an existing state. Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the views of the state legislature are considered, the final decision on altering a state's boundaries rests with Parliament.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The Supreme Court doesn't have the primary authority to determine the process of state formation; that power lies with Parliament under Article 3. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


10. Consider the following statements regarding the Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges:

1. It consists of members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.
2.  It investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges, including those related to the Lok Sabha.
3.  Its chairman is appointed by the Lok Sabha Speaker.
4.  The committee has the power to prosecute individuals for violating parliamentary privileges.


Which of the statements accurately reflect the functions and composition of the Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges is composed of members nominated by the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. Statement 2 is correct. The Committee investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges that affect either House of Parliament. Statement 3 is incorrect. The chairman of the Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges is appointed by the Rajya Sabha Chairman, not the Lok Sabha Speaker.  Statement 4 is incorrect. The Committee investigates and reports on breaches of privilege; it does not have the direct power to prosecute.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding Protected and Restricted Areas in India:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2.  Parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand fall under Protected Areas.
3.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are wholly declared as a Restricted Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
4.  A foreigner, irrespective of nationality, requires a special permit to enter a Protected or Restricted Area unless exceptional circumstances are proven.

How many of the above statements are accurate depictions of the legal framework governing access to Protected and Restricted Areas in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the distribution of Protected and Restricted Areas in India as per the provided text.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area,  parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are also designated as such.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are completely classified as a Restricted Area. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While it's true that special permits are generally required for foreigners, the text specifies an exception for Bhutanese citizens.  They do not require special permits. This subtle distinction makes statement 4 factually inaccurate.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


**2. Consider the following aspects of India’s Fiscal Federalism:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and States.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Centre, but wholly assigned to States, are governed by Article 268.
3.  The distribution of revenue from taxes levied and collected by the Union, including corporation tax and personal income tax, is determined solely by the Union Government without any consultation with state governments.
4.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending the distribution of resources between the Union and States.

Which of the above statements correctly describe key elements of India’s fiscal federalism arrangement?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Seventh Schedule (Article 246) details the tax powers of the Union and States. Statement 2 is also correct: Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to States. Statement 3 is incorrect:  While the Union Government levies and collects many taxes, their distribution between the Union and States is significantly influenced by the Finance Commission's recommendations (Article 270).  The GST Council also plays a crucial role in the distribution of GST revenue. Statement 4 is correct:  Article 280 mandates the establishment of the Finance Commission to advise on the distribution of financial resources.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of India's fiscal federalism.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI):**

1.  The CBI was established in 1963 based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee.
2.  The CBI is a constitutional body, its functioning defined within the Constitution of India.
3.  The CBI Director's selection involves a panel comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.
4.  The CBI operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.

Which of the above statements accurately describe the CBI's structure, powers, and legal basis?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The Santhanam Committee's recommendations led to the CBI's formation in 1963. Statement 2 is incorrect: The CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body.  Its powers and functions are derived from the DSPE Act, not the Constitution. Statement 3 is correct: The selection panel for the CBI Director includes the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Chief Justice of India. Statement 4 is correct: The DSPE Act, 1946, is the primary legislation governing the CBI's operations. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the President of India's powers:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only in cases involving offenses against laws related to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President can commute a death sentence.
3.  The President's power to grant pardons extends to cases decided by court-martials.
4.  A Bill affecting the boundaries of a state requires the President's recommendation before introduction in Parliament, but not necessarily consultation with the state legislature.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the President's powers under the Indian Constitution?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: Article 72 grants the President pardon powers in a broader context, including offenses against any law to which the executive power of the Union extends, not exclusively limited to this. Statement 2 is correct: The President can commute (reduce) a death sentence under Article 72. Statement 3 is correct:  The President's pardon power extends to court-martial cases. Statement 4 is incorrect:  While the President's recommendation is required for a Bill affecting state boundaries, the text clearly states that consultation with the state legislature is also necessary.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are completely accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions coordinates the implementation of the RTI Act.
3. The RTI Act explicitly mentions the "right to be forgotten" as a citizen's right to data control.
4. The Supreme Court case of "Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government" established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the RTI Act and its legal basis?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The RTI Act of 2005 superseded the Freedom of Information Act of 2002. Statement 2 is correct: The Department of Personnel and Training plays a key role in coordinating the RTI Act's implementation. Statement 3 is incorrect: The "right to be forgotten" is not explicitly mentioned in the RTI Act; it's a concept debated in data protection laws.  Statement 4 is correct:  The Raj Narayan case is pivotal in understanding the judicial recognition of RTI as linked to fundamental rights. Hence, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are factually accurate about the RTI Act.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system:**

1. The ILP system aims to protect tribal cultures in northeastern India.
2.  The ILP system is only applicable to foreign nationals seeking entry into designated areas.
3.  The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 are the origins of the ILP system.
4.  NRIs and OCI holders are eligible for ILPs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the ILP system and its historical context?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The ILP system is indeed used to protect tribal cultures in northeastern India. Statement 2 is incorrect:  The ILP system applies to Indian citizens as well, regulating their movement into protected areas. Statement 3 is correct: The Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873 form the basis of the ILP system. Statement 4 is incorrect: NRIs and OCI holders are *not* eligible for ILPs; they require Protected/Restricted Area Permits.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 correctly describe the ILP system.


**7. Consider the following statements about State Reorganization in India:**

1. The S.K. Dhar Commission recommended state reorganization primarily based on linguistic factors.
2. The JVP Committee rejected language as a basis for state reorganization.
3. The Fazl Ali Commission identified linguistic and cultural homogeneity as one factor for state reorganization.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the commissions and committees involved in state reorganization in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The S.K. Dhar Commission prioritized administrative convenience over linguistic factors. Statement 2 is correct: The JVP Committee opposed using language as the primary basis for reorganization. Statement 3 is correct: The Fazl Ali Commission did include linguistic and cultural homogeneity as a significant criterion. Statement 4 is partially incorrect:  While the Fazl Ali Commission made those recommendations, their full implementation happened through the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, not immediately.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements about the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1.  The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution.
2. The NCSC investigates complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.
3. The NCSC's recommendations are binding on the government.
4.  The NCSC is empowered to issue directions to the Central and State governments.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the powers and functions of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: While the NCSC is a very important body, it is a statutory body, not a constitutional one. It was established by the Constitution (Eighty-ninth Amendment) Act, 2003, not as a part of the original Constitution. Statement 2 is correct:  A primary function of the NCSC is investigating complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes. Statement 3 is incorrect:  The NCSC's recommendations are not legally binding but carry significant weight and influence. Statement 4 is correct: The NCSC can issue directions to both the Central and State governments.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately describe the NCSC's functions.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.
3. The Supreme Court, in the case of *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government*, established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.
4. Section 8 of the RTI Act exempts certain information from disclosure, including information related to intelligence and security organizations specified in the Second Schedule.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the RTI Act's provisions and history.  The RTI Act of 2005 indeed superseded the earlier Freedom of Information Act, 2002, aiming for a more robust and effective mechanism for citizen access to information. The Department of Personnel and Training plays a crucial role in coordinating the implementation of the Act.  Section 8 of the Act explicitly outlines exemptions, prioritizing national security and other sensitive areas.

Statement 3, however, is partially inaccurate. While the *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government* case significantly contributed to the evolution of the right to information in India, it did not explicitly establish RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.  The Supreme Court's pronouncements in this case influenced the legal framework leading to the RTI Act but didn't directly equate RTI with Article 19.  The right to information is considered a crucial element of transparency and accountability within the broader framework of fundamental rights, but its precise constitutional status remains a subject of legal interpretation.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023:**

1. The DPDP Act aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data while ensuring individuals' right to protect their data.
2.  The Act establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) with the power to impose penalties for non-compliance.
3. The Act allows the transfer of personal data outside India without any restrictions.
4.  The Act specifies penalties for various offenses, including significant penalties for breaches related to children's data.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe key aspects of the DPDP Act. The Act's core objective is to balance the utilization of digital personal data with robust safeguards for individual privacy rights. The DPBI is a central component of the Act, tasked with overseeing compliance and imposing penalties.  The Act also includes provisions for substantial penalties, particularly concerning the misuse or breach of children's data, reflecting a heightened concern for vulnerable populations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The DPDP Act does *not* allow unrestricted transfer of personal data outside India.  It includes provisions for regulating cross-border data flows, allowing transfers only to countries that meet certain criteria or under specific circumstances.  This reflects a growing global awareness of the need to protect data sovereignty and prevent the uncontrolled movement of sensitive personal information.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS):**

1. The BNSS replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC).
2. The BNSS mandates forensic investigation for all offenses punishable with imprisonment.
3.  The BNSS introduces provisions for the release of first-time offenders on bail after serving one-third of their maximum sentence, with certain exceptions.
4. The BNSS allows police officers to request medical examinations of accused individuals in all cases.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 correctly reflect key features of the BNSS.  The BNSS is indeed a significant overhaul of the criminal procedure, aiming for greater efficiency and fairness.  The provisions for the release of first-time offenders after serving a portion of their sentence aim to reduce overcrowding in prisons and address concerns about prolonged pretrial detention.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BNSS mandates forensic investigation for offenses punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment, not for all offenses.  This reflects a prioritization of resources and a focus on cases involving more serious crimes.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. While the BNSS does allow for medical examinations, it's not applicable to all cases; rather, it's limited to specific situations, such as cases involving sexual assault. This nuanced approach prevents unnecessary medical interventions.


**4. Consider the following regarding the President's powers concerning mercy petitions:**

1. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in cases involving court-martial convictions.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases where the sentence is imposed for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.
3. The President's power under Article 72 applies only to death sentences.
4.  A curative petition is the last constitutional remedy available to a person whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Article 72 of the Constitution grants the President broad powers regarding clemency, encompassing various forms of sentence modification or pardon. This power extends to both cases involving court-martials and those concerning offenses under laws within the Union's executive purview. A curative petition is indeed the final recourse in the Supreme Court for individuals whose review petitions have been rejected.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the President's power under Article 72 does apply to death sentences, it's not limited to them.  The President can exercise clemency in a wider range of cases, including those involving other severe punishments.  The power is designed to offer a final check on judicial decisions, ensuring fairness and justice.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993.
2. The NHRC's headquarters are located in Mumbai.
3.  The NHRC's accreditation by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has been deferred in recent years due to concerns about staff diversity and protection of marginalized groups.
4. The NHRC's primary function is to investigate human rights violations and recommend remedial action.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, tasked with safeguarding human rights in India.  Recent concerns regarding staff diversity and the protection of marginalized groups have indeed led to the deferral of its GANHRI accreditation.  A core function of the NHRC is to investigate human rights violations and propose appropriate remedies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's headquarters are located in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  This is a crucial detail for anyone studying Indian governance structures. The location of key institutions is often a part of UPSC questions.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and its replacement, the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023:**

1. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
2. The 2023 Act allows for the admissibility of electronic and digital records as evidence, with the same legal effect as paper records.
3. The 2023 Act prohibits oral evidence given electronically.
4. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, was enacted to consolidate laws relating to evidence.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, is a significant legislative reform that replaces the outdated Indian Evidence Act, 1872. A key modernization is the provision for electronic and digital records as admissible evidence, reflecting the digital age. The original 1872 Act aimed to consolidate and streamline the laws of evidence.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The 2023 Act actually *allows* for oral evidence to be given electronically, further modernizing court procedures and adapting to technological advancements.  This feature enhances accessibility and efficiency in legal proceedings.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Aadhaar card:**

1. The Aadhaar card is issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
2.  The Aadhaar card provides authoritative proof of date of birth.
3.  The Aadhaar number is a 12-digit unique identification number.
4.  The Aadhaar card can be deactivated or omitted by the UIDAI.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The UIDAI is responsible for issuing Aadhaar cards, assigning unique 12-digit numbers to individuals, and retaining the power to deactivate or omit Aadhaar records as needed.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Aadhaar card can be used *as evidence* of date of birth, it is not considered authoritative proof.  This distinction is crucial.  Other forms of documentation may be required to definitively establish date of birth for official purposes.  The Supreme Court has explicitly clarified this point.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Office of the Chief Justice of India:**

1. In 2019, the Supreme Court held that the Office of the Chief Justice of India is a Public Authority under the RTI Act.
2.  Lower courts are permitted to entertain suits or applications challenging decisions related to the Office of the Chief Justice of India.
3. The writ jurisdiction of the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 32 and 226 remains unaffected by the RTI Act's application to the Office of the Chief Justice of India.
4. The RTI Act mandates that the Office of the Chief Justice of India must disclose all information requested by citizens.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The 2019 Supreme Court ruling established the Office of the Chief Justice of India as a Public Authority under the RTI Act, subject to the Act's provisions and exemptions.  Importantly, the Supreme Court and High Courts retain their writ jurisdiction, unaffected by the RTI Act's application to the Chief Justice's office.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Lower courts are generally barred from entertaining suits or applications against the Office of the Chief Justice of India.  This is to prevent interference with the higher judiciary's functions and to maintain the hierarchy of the judicial system.  Statement 4 is also incorrect.  While the Office of the Chief Justice of India is subject to RTI, it is not obligated to disclose all information requested, as certain information may fall under the exemptions outlined in the Act.  The balance between transparency and the need to protect sensitive information is carefully considered.


**9. Consider the following statements related to the Prakash Singh judgment of 2006:**

1.  The judgment is related to environmental conservation.
2. The judgment deals with electoral reforms.
3. The judgment focuses on police reforms.
4. The judgment concerns judicial accountability.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The Prakash Singh judgment of 2006 is a landmark Supreme Court decision that significantly impacted police reforms in India. The judgment outlined several crucial directives aimed at improving police accountability, efficiency, and independence.  The other statements are incorrect. The Prakash Singh judgment did not primarily address environmental conservation, electoral reforms, or judicial accountability, though these areas are certainly important for good governance.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Kasturirangan Committee:**

1. The committee's work is related to Centre-state fiscal relationships.
2. The committee focused on reforms in the banking sector.
3. The committee dealt with army pay scales.
4. The committee's report concerned the conservation of the Western Ghats.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 4 is correct. The Kasturirangan Committee was primarily concerned with the ecological conservation of the Western Ghats, a crucial biodiversity hotspot in India.  The committee's report provided recommendations for sustainable development in the region, balancing environmental protection with the needs of local communities. The other statements are incorrect; the Kasturirangan Committee's work was not directly related to Centre-state fiscal relations, banking sector reforms, or army pay scales.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 4 are correct. iCAL aims to establish global standards and enhance auditor independence. Statement 1 is incorrect; iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Ahmedabad. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the CAG's mandate covers local body audits, iCAL's establishment is not directly attributed to the CAG.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 4 are correct.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Act came into force in October 2005, but was enacted earlier in June 2005. Statement 3 is incorrect because the RTI Act draws inspiration from international human rights covenants and declarations.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024:**

1. These rules came into effect in June 2023.
2. They mandate the filing of an FIR if a prima facie case of unfair means is reported.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The rules do stipulate the filing of an FIR for a prima facie case of unfair means.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the rules came into effect in June 2024, not 2023. Statement 3 is incorrect because the committee is formed if the management or board of directors of the service provider is involved, not just invigilators. Statement 4 is also incorrect as the rules apply to public examinations in general, not just national-level ones.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Post Office Act, 2023:**

Statement 3 is incorrect; the Act lacks extensive penal provisions. Statement 4 is incorrect because government interception requires specified grounds, such as national security or public order. Therefore, only two statements are correct.

**Explanation:**

All four statements are incorrect. Aadhaar does *not* capture caste, religion, or income; it is *not* proof of citizenship or domicile; the Supreme Court upheld, not struck down, the Aadhaar Act; and the government cannot contract private corporations for unrestricted Aadhaar data sharing.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the auditing of local bodies in India:**

1. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 mandate the online audit of panchayat accounts.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the audit of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
3. The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states audit the utilization of funds granted by the central government to local bodies.
4. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, has been awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 established the framework for local self-governance, they don't specifically mandate online auditing.  The online audit is a more recent development facilitated by technological advancements.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, encompassing all three tiers of PRIs and ULBs.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  ELFA/DLFA audit the utilization of funds granted by the *state* government, not the central government.  Central government funding might have separate audit mechanisms.

Statement 4 is correct. The AuditOnline application did receive the mentioned award, highlighting its contribution to improving accountability in local governance.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**2. Consider the following features of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. It aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2. It serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and local government auditors.
3. It enhances the dependence of local government auditors on the central government for financial assessments.
4. It acts as a knowledge center and think tank for addressing governance issues at the national level.

Which of the above features accurately describe iCAL?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; iCAL's primary goal is setting global standards for local governance audits.

Statement 2 is also correct; iCAL is designed as a collaborative platform.

Statement 3 is incorrect. iCAL aims to enhance the *independence* of local government auditors, not their dependence.  Improved independence is crucial for unbiased assessments.

Statement 4 is partially incorrect. While iCAL acts as a knowledge center and think tank, its focus is on addressing governance issues at the *grassroot* levels, not just nationally.

Thus, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect iCAL's features.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented by state governments.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the center.

Statement 2 is correct. The 2015 report forms the basis of the current CSS framework.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act?

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MHA is the implementing agency for the FCRA.

Statement 2 is correct.  Aadhaar submission for office-bearers is a mandatory requirement for FCRA registration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FCRA restricts the use of foreign funds to the specific purpose for which they were received, with limitations on administrative expenses.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule applies only to specific states, primarily in the Northeast.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule is not primarily concerned with the financial management of union territories; it deals with the administration of tribal areas within specific states.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.
