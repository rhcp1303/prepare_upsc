**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, excluding those in Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya, appointed by the State government in consultation with the High Court, is deemed to be a Court of Judicial Magistrate of First Class and operates as a mobile court, primarily focusing on conciliation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of Gram Nyayalayas.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Act establishing these courts and their jurisdiction, including the explicit exclusion of certain states and tribal areas.  The Act's aim is to provide accessible justice at the village level, handling petty disputes. Statement 2 correctly describes the Nyayadhikari's status as a Judicial Magistrate of First Class and the mobile court nature of the Gram Nyayalaya.  Emphasis on conciliation is a key feature of their dispute resolution process, aiming for amicable settlements.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or obstruct the administration of justice, as defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively, and this power is subject to judicial review, ensuring that it's not used arbitrarily.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Statement 1 accurately distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt.  Civil contempt focuses on the disobedience of court orders or undertakings, while criminal contempt involves actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct the judicial process. The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the legal framework. Statement 2 correctly points out the constitutional basis of the Supreme Court's and High Courts' power to punish for contempt (Articles 129 and 215). Importantly, the statement also highlights the crucial aspect of judicial review, which acts as a check on the potential for abuse of this power, ensuring that the exercise of contempt powers aligns with the principles of justice and fairness.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**3. With reference to the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's ruling in *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh & Others* allows for sub-classification within Scheduled Castes to address varying degrees of backwardness among different groups, based on Article 341(1) which permits the President to specify SCs.
2.  Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, as permitted by the Supreme Court, does not violate Article 341(2), which grants Parliament the power to modify the list of Scheduled Castes through legislation, and aims to achieve substantive equality by providing separate quotas for more backward groups within the SC categories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Supreme Court's decision in *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh & Others* is central to this question. Statement 1 correctly reflects the court's affirmation of the permissibility of sub-classification within the Scheduled Castes to address intra-caste disparities in backwardness. This aligns with the President's power under Article 341(1) to specify castes as Scheduled Castes. Statement 2 is also correct because the court's ruling clarifies that sub-classification doesn't contravene Article 341(2), which allows Parliament to amend the SC list. The sub-classification aims at achieving substantive equality, a critical principle in affirmative action policies, by recognizing and addressing the distinct needs of various groups within the SC category.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**4. With reference to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  FPTP systems, used in India for Lok Sabha and State Assembly elections, elect one representative per constituency, potentially leading to disproportionate representation of parties based on their vote share, unlike PR systems which aim for proportional representation based on vote share.
2.  PR systems, while ensuring fairer representation of smaller parties, can lead to coalition governments that might be less stable compared to the generally more stable governments often formed under FPTP systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately contrast FPTP and PR electoral systems. Statement 1 correctly highlights the key difference: FPTP, a winner-takes-all system, elects one representative per constituency regardless of the overall vote share, which can lead to situations where a party wins a majority of seats without securing a majority of votes.  In contrast, PR systems aim to allocate seats proportionally to the votes received by each party. Statement 2 accurately points out a potential drawback of PR systems: the greater representation of smaller parties can result in fragmented legislatures and coalition governments, which may be less stable than single-party governments common in FPTP systems.  Thus, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., only for offenses against laws where the executive power of the Union extends, excluding offenses tried by court-martial.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to commuting death sentences, but the exercise of this power is not subject to judicial review and is entirely at the President's discretion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect because Article 72 explicitly includes the power to pardon in cases involving court-martial sentences.  The President's power extends to a wide range of offenses, including those tried by court-martial, where the Union's executive power applies. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President's power under Article 72 does extend to commuting death sentences, this power, like other executive powers, is not entirely free from judicial scrutiny. Although the courts may not directly review the President's decision on a mercy petition, they can review the process leading to the decision if any illegality or violation of natural justice is involved.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition is the final legal recourse available to a litigant after their review petition under Article 137 has been rejected by the Supreme Court, providing a mechanism for addressing exceptional circumstances.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 142, which enables the Court to do complete justice, and such petitions can be filed only if there is a violation of principles of natural justice or evidence of bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key aspects of curative petitions in the Indian legal system. Statement 1 accurately defines a curative petition as the last resort available after a review petition under Article 137 is dismissed.  It serves as a safety valve for addressing extraordinary situations where grave errors of justice might have occurred. Statement 2 correctly identifies Article 142 as the constitutional basis for the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction.  The statement also accurately mentions the grounds on which a curative petition can be entertained, notably violations of natural justice or demonstrable bias.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs, a centrally sponsored scheme funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, aim to expedite the disposal of rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act, and are implemented by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.
2.  While the target was to establish 1023 FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO Courts,  a significantly smaller number are currently functional across various states and union territories, indicating challenges in implementation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect information about FTSCs. Statement 1 correctly describes the scheme's objectives, funding source (Nirbhaya Fund), and implementing agency.  The primary goal is to ensure speedy justice in rape and POCSO cases. Statement 2 correctly points out the discrepancy between the planned number of FTSCs and the actual number operational. This highlights the challenges in the effective and timely implementation of the scheme across different states and union territories. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**8. With reference to the acquisition of Indian citizenship by naturalization, consider the following statements:**

1.  Applicants for citizenship by naturalization must demonstrate adequate knowledge of a language listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, and provide proof of their entry into India using a range of specified documents.
2.  Applicants must formally renounce their previous citizenship, and applications are submitted electronically to an Empowered Committee through a District Level Committee, as per Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe requirements for acquiring Indian citizenship through naturalization. Statement 1 correctly mentions the language proficiency requirement (a language from the Eighth Schedule) and the wide range of acceptable documents to prove entry into India.  This reflects the process's emphasis on verifiable evidence of residency and integration. Statement 2 correctly states the requirement of renouncing previous citizenship and outlines the application procedure as stipulated under Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955, involving an Empowered Committee and District Level Committees.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**9.  With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAA grants a path to citizenship for illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians, and who entered India before December 31, 2014, excluding those from certain tribal areas or areas under Inner Line Permits.
2.  The CAA exempts specified religious minorities from the adverse consequences of existing laws like the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and reduces the naturalization period for them to 5 years while providing grounds for the cancellation of Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe key provisions of the CAA, 2019.  Statement 1 accurately outlines the categories of religious minorities eligible for citizenship under the Act, specifying the cut-off date (December 31, 2014) and the exclusion of certain regions.  This reflects the Act's specific focus on religious minorities from neighboring countries. Statement 2 correctly points out that the Act exempts these religious minorities from penalties under existing immigration laws, and reduces the naturalization period.  It also correctly mentions the inclusion of provisions related to OCI cardholders.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.



**10. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates the preservation of the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, prohibiting conversions, with exceptions for the Ayodhya site and monuments under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.
2.  The Act abates any pending legal proceedings related to the conversion of places of worship that existed before August 15, 1947, and prescribes penalties for violating its provisions, including imprisonment and fines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core provisions of the Places of Worship Act, 1991. Statement 1 correctly describes the Act's main objective: maintaining the religious character of places of worship as it stood on the date of Independence.  The statement also correctly identifies the key exemptions related to the Ayodhya site and monuments covered under the Ancient Monuments Act. Statement 2 correctly notes that the Act abates pre-existing legal cases concerning religious conversions and specifies penalties for violations, including imprisonment and fines.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**11. With reference to preventive detention, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive detention allows for the detention of individuals without trial based on reasonable apprehension of harm to public order, with parliamentary and state legislative powers to enact such laws under Article 22.
2.  Article 22(1) and 22(2) provide constitutional protections against arbitrary arrest and detention, but these protections do not apply to individuals detained under preventive detention laws, as per Article 22(3), and the detenu has the right to make an effective representation against such detention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe aspects of preventive detention in India. Statement 1 correctly defines preventive detention as a measure to detain individuals without trial based on reasonable apprehension of threat to public order. It also correctly mentions the constitutional basis (Article 22) for parliamentary and state legislatures to enact such laws. Statement 2 correctly points out the constitutional safeguards in Article 22(1) and 22(2) against arbitrary arrest and detention, but clarifies that these safeguards are not applicable to preventive detention under Article 22(3). The recent Supreme Court case highlighting the detenu's right to an effective representation further reinforces the importance of due process even within the framework of preventive detention. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect.


**12. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, stemming from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specified states, granting them significant legislative, executive, and judicial powers.
2.  ADCs, with a maximum of 30 members (including nominated members), and ARCs have powers over subjects like land revenue, taxation, and forest management, while the Fifth Schedule focuses on the establishment of Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) with more limited powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately contrast the Sixth Schedule with the Fifth Schedule. Statement 1 correctly identifies the origin of the Sixth Schedule (Bardoloi Committee) and its empowering provision for the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs. The statement also correctly highlights the extensive powers granted to these councils. Statement 2 correctly differentiates between the Sixth Schedule's ADCs and ARCs and the Fifth Schedule's TACs, emphasizing the greater autonomy and powers of the former compared to the limited powers of the latter.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**13. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 of the Constitution empowers Parliament to create new states by altering existing state boundaries or uniting territories, but such a bill can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's prior recommendation.
2.  The process of state formation under Article 3 involves a detailed procedure that includes consultations with affected states and requires a majority vote in both houses of Parliament, reflecting the constitutional importance of this process.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the constitutional provision for state formation under Article 3. It correctly states that Parliament has the power to create new states, but it requires the President's prior recommendation before a bill can be introduced. This highlights the executive's role in initiating the process. While statement 2 mentions the consultation process and parliamentary approval, it doesn't accurately reflect the complete procedure. Although consultations are generally held, they are not mandated by Article 3.  Similarly, while a majority vote in both houses is required, the detail regarding the procedure is an oversimplification.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely correct, making (a) the correct option.


**14. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, initially granting special financial assistance to states like Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland, using the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
2.  The Constitution doesn't explicitly provide for SCS, but various special provisions under Articles 371 to 371-J offer a range of benefits to several states, and following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS category was abolished.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the history and nature of Special Category States in India. Statement 1 correctly traces the origin of SCS to the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations in 1969, listing some of the initial states granted this status and mentioning the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for financial assistance. Statement 2 correctly highlights the absence of a constitutional provision for SCS, but accurately notes the existence of various special provisions under Articles 371 to 371-J that provide benefits to specific states. The statement also correctly points out the abolition of the SCS category following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.


**15. With reference to Special Packages for states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Special Packages, granted under Article 282, provide additional financial assistance to states facing geographical and socio-economic challenges, and are purely discretionary, not necessarily based solely on demonstrable need.
2.  The allocation of Special Packages is subject to strict criteria and guidelines, ensuring equitable distribution among states based on objective assessment of needs, and are always provided as a result of specific requests from the Chief Ministers of the states concerned.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Special Packages. It correctly identifies Article 282 as the constitutional basis and highlights their discretionary nature—they are not strictly tied to objective need assessments.  The statement also correctly notes that they are provided to address geographical and socio-economic challenges. Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The allocation of Special Packages is not governed by strict, pre-defined criteria; they are discretionary, and while requests from Chief Ministers might trigger consideration, they are not always granted solely based on such requests. The decision often depends on various political and economic factors. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are exempted from the jurisdiction of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but are bound by the principles of natural justice.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Governor solely based on the Governor's discretion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, are not bound by the stringent rules of evidence stipulated in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  However, they are obligated to adhere to the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and impartiality in their proceedings. This allows for a more flexible and accessible dispute resolution process at the village level.  The emphasis on natural justice safeguards the rights of the parties involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the State government appoints the Nyayadhikari for each Gram Nyayalaya, this appointment is not solely based on the Governor's discretion.  The Act mandates consultation with the High Court before making the appointment, ensuring that the selection process considers judicial expertise and maintains the integrity of the court system.  The consultation with the High Court safeguards against arbitrary appointments and upholds judicial standards.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court's order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the court's authority.
2. The power to punish for contempt of court is explicitly granted to the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 129 and 215 respectively, but not to subordinate courts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines the distinction between civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt focuses on the defiance of court orders, decrees, or processes, essentially a failure to comply with the court's directives. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, encompasses actions that undermine the court's dignity, authority, or the administration of justice.  This includes publications that scandalize the court or interfere with judicial proceedings.  The two types of contempt have different implications and penalties.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, inherent powers to punish contempt, this power is not exclusively limited to these higher courts.  Subordinate courts also possess the power to punish for contempt, though their jurisdiction and the nature of the contempt they can punish might be more restricted compared to the higher courts.  The power of subordinate courts to punish for contempt is derived from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and related legal provisions.


**3. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's primary aim is to enhance the role of Panchayati Raj Institutions in local development planning.
2. The Abhiyan exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayats, excluding Block and District Panchayats from its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign) is fundamentally aimed at boosting people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  This directly enhances the role of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in local development planning by incorporating the needs and aspirations of the community.  The active involvement of elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations is crucial to this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's implementation encompasses all three tiers of Panchayats—Gram Panchayats, Block Panchayats, and District Panchayats.  The structured meetings (Ward Sabha, Mahila Sabha, Gram Sabha, Block Sabha, District Sabha) are held at each level to facilitate the preparation of development plans at the respective levels (GPDP, Block PDP, District PDP).  The inclusive approach ensures a comprehensive and multi-layered planning process.


**4. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL was established to enhance the independence of local government auditors and improve financial performance assessment.
2. iCAL's primary focus is on auditing the accounts of Central Government ministries and departments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The iCAL (International Centre for Audit of Local Governance) was established with a clear mandate to improve the auditing of local governance bodies. A key aspect of this is enhancing the independence of local government auditors.  This independence is crucial to ensure objective and unbiased assessments of financial performance and service delivery.  The center acts as a hub for capacity building and knowledge sharing in this area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL's focus is specifically on local governance bodies, not on Central Government ministries or departments.  Its role is to establish global standards for auditing local bodies, focusing on improving accountability and transparency at the grassroots level.  The audit of central government entities falls under the purview of different auditing bodies, primarily the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).


**5. With reference to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems, consider the following statements:**

1. FPTP systems tend to produce more stable governments compared to PR systems, but PR systems offer better representation of minority parties.
2.  In FPTP systems, a candidate needs an absolute majority of votes to win, while in PR systems, seats are allocated proportionally to the votes received by each party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. FPTP systems, where the candidate with the most votes wins, often lead to the formation of single-party majority governments, enhancing governmental stability.  However, PR systems, where seats are allocated proportionally to votes received, frequently result in coalition governments, which can be less stable.  PR systems, by their nature, ensure better representation for smaller parties and minority viewpoints, a feature often lacking in FPTP systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  In FPTP systems, a candidate only needs a plurality (more votes than any other candidate), not an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes), to win.  In PR systems, seats are allocated proportionally to the votes received, ensuring that a party's representation in the legislature reflects its share of the popular vote.  The difference between plurality and majority is a crucial distinction in understanding the mechanics of these electoral systems.


**6. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who belong to six religious minorities from three neighboring countries, provided they entered India before a specified date.
2. The CAA applies uniformly across all states and union territories of India, without any exceptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key provision of the CAA. The Act provides a pathway to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants belonging to six religious minority communities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian) who have fled persecution from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan, and entered India before December 31, 2014.  This provision has been a subject of considerable debate and legal challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CAA does contain exceptions.  Specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, and Tripura (listed in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution) and areas under Inner Line Permits (ILPs) in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, and Nagaland are excluded from the purview of the Act.  These exclusions reflect the sensitivity surrounding the application of the Act in regions with unique demographic and historical contexts.


**7.  With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar is a proof of both citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Supreme Court, in its 2018 judgment, declared Aadhaar mandatory for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, but it is not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal processes, and domicile refers to a person's permanent residence, which is distinct from identity.  Aadhaar primarily serves as a biometric identifier, facilitating various government services and welfare schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but did *not* make Aadhaar mandatory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  While Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, the court emphasized that it cannot be forced on individuals for other services.  The ruling sought to balance the benefits of Aadhaar with the protection of fundamental rights.


**8. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1. CSS are schemes funded entirely by the Central Government and implemented by the State Governments.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on a report submitted by a committee of Chief Ministers in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSS (Centrally Sponsored Schemes) are jointly funded by the Central and State Governments.  While the Central Government provides a significant portion of the funding, State Governments also contribute, reflecting a collaborative approach to implementing schemes in sectors listed in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.  This shared funding model underscores the federal structure of India's governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, which submitted its report in 2015.  This report proposed several reforms to streamline the implementation and effectiveness of CSSs, aiming for better coordination and resource allocation between the Centre and States.  The report's recommendations have significantly shaped the current design of CSSs.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specific states.
2.  ADCs and ARCs have limited powers, primarily focusing on administrative functions, excluding legislative and judicial powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2) of the Constitution, grants the Governor the power to establish ADCs (Autonomous District Councils) and ARCs (Autonomous Regional Councils) in the four states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils are designed to provide greater autonomy to tribal populations in these regions, allowing them to manage their own affairs within a specified framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs possess a broader range of powers than merely administrative functions. They exercise executive, legislative, and even some judicial powers within their respective jurisdictions.  These powers encompass areas such as forest management, agriculture, inheritance laws, social customs, taxation, and regulation of trade. The extent of their powers is significant, reflecting the principle of self-governance for tribal areas.


**10. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India has the sole authority to create new states by issuing an executive order.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state requires the recommendation of the President before being introduced in Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President of India does not have the sole authority to create new states through an executive order. The power to form new states or alter the boundaries of existing ones rests with the Parliament, as enshrined in Article 3 of the Constitution.  The process involves the passage of a law by Parliament, not a simple executive decision.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly states that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in either House of Parliament *after* receiving the recommendation of the President. This requirement ensures that such a significant constitutional change is considered carefully and with the President's concurrence, reflecting the importance of the process within the framework of India's federal system.


**11. With reference to Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) examines the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India, and its members are appointed by the Prime Minister.
2. The Estimates Committee scrutinizes government estimates and suggests improvements in administrative efficiency, and its members are drawn from both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the PAC does examine the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India, its members are *not* appointed by the Prime Minister.  The members of the PAC are elected by the Lok Sabha, with a proportional representation of the different parties in the House.  This ensures a degree of independence and diverse perspectives in the committee's work.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The Estimates Committee primarily focuses on scrutinizing government estimates and suggesting ways to improve administrative efficiency.  However, its members are drawn *only* from the Lok Sabha, not both Houses of Parliament. This is a key difference between the composition of the Estimates Committee and other parliamentary committees that might include members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.


**12. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that the religious character of a place of worship shall remain unchanged from what it was on August 15, 1947.
2. The Act applies equally to all places of worship, including the disputed site at Ayodhya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, has a central provision that the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, shall be maintained.  This means that any attempt to alter the religious character of a place of worship from what it was on that date is prohibited. This provision aims to maintain the status quo ante.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A significant exception to the Act is the disputed site at Ayodhya.  The Act explicitly exempts the Ayodhya site from its purview.  This exemption reflects the unique historical and political context of the Ayodhya dispute, which was handled separately through legal and other processes.  The exemption highlights the Act's limitations in addressing certain complex situations.


**13. With reference to preventive detention in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive detention allows for the detention of individuals without trial, based solely on the suspicion of future criminal activity.
2.  The Constitution of India prohibits any form of preventive detention under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Preventive detention is a legal mechanism that allows for the detention of an individual without a trial or conviction.  The basis for such detention is the reasonable apprehension that the individual might engage in activities that are prejudicial to public order or security.  This is distinct from ordinary criminal procedure, where detention follows a trial and conviction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* completely prohibit preventive detention.  While Article 22 guarantees certain protections against arbitrary arrest and detention, it also allows Parliament and State Legislatures to enact laws providing for preventive detention (Article 22(3)).  However, such laws are subject to specific safeguards, including the right to consult with a legal practitioner and the requirement of placing the grounds of detention before the detainee.  The existence of these safeguards does not negate the fact that preventive detention is constitutionally permissible within specified limits.



**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) by incorporating a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI), a multi-domain and multi-sectoral index used to assess the overall development of panchayats, is a crucial component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, guiding the identification of thematic developmental gaps to be addressed in Gram Sabhas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign).  Statement 1 correctly identifies the campaign's aim to increase public participation in PDP preparation and its utilization of a thematic approach aligned with localized SDGs. The "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach" further emphasizes this participatory and integrated strategy. Statement 2 is also correct; the PDI serves as a vital tool within the Abhiyan framework.  It's used to assess panchayat progress and identify specific developmental needs, which are then presented and discussed in Gram Sabhas. The PDI's multi-sectoral nature ensures a holistic assessment, aligning with the comprehensive goals of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in either statement.


**2. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, these courts operate as mobile courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction, settling petty disputes at the village level and are exempt from the rules of evidence outlined in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are located at the headquarters of intermediate Panchayats and function under the supervision of a Nyayadhikari appointed by the State government in consultation with the High Court, with appeals in criminal cases going to the Court of Session and civil cases to the district court, all within a six-month timeframe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the key features of Gram Nyayalayas. Statement 1 correctly points out their establishment under the 2008 Act, their mobile nature, dual jurisdiction (civil and criminal), focus on petty disputes, and exemption from standard evidentiary rules (though they are bound by principles of natural justice).  Statement 2 is also accurate, highlighting the location of these courts, the appointment process of the Nyayadhikari, and the appellate process with its six-month timeframe.  The statements avoid any misleading information or factual inaccuracies; they present a comprehensive, albeit concise, description of the Gram Nyayalaya system.


**3. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1.  Inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies, focusing solely on financial audits to ensure transparency and accountability in local government spending.
2.  iCAL is the first such center in India, playing a crucial role in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of local governance through the standardization of auditing practices and fostering collaboration among national and international auditing bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While iCAL's location and aim to set global standards are accurate, its focus is not *solely* on financial audits.  The scope likely extends to broader aspects of local governance auditing.  Statement 2 is entirely correct. iCAL's establishment as the first such center in India and its role in improving local governance through standardization and collaboration are accurate reflections of its purpose. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.  The partial inaccuracy in statement 1 makes option (b) the correct choice.


**4. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional framework explicitly defines the criteria for categorizing a state as an SCS, with states receiving special financial assistance based on a formula determined by the Fourteenth Finance Commission.
2.  The concept of SCS, initially introduced in 1969, has been discontinued following the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, with current special funding to Northeastern and Himalayan states based on different recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly define criteria for SCS status.  While special financial assistance was provided, it was based on various formulas, not solely that of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.  Statement 2 is correct. The Fourteenth Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS categorization, with current funding patterns for states like those in the Northeast and Himalayas stemming from different sources (e.g., recommendations of Chief Ministers' Sub-Groups).  The key inaccuracy in statement 1 makes option (b) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only for offenses against laws related to matters under the Union's executive power, excluding those involving court-martial proceedings.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to all sentences, including death sentences, but excludes cases where the conviction originates from state-level courts handling offences under state laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 incorrectly limits the President's power under Article 72.  The article explicitly includes offenses tried by court-martial.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the President's power extends to death sentences regardless of whether the conviction arises from Union or state courts.  Article 72's scope is broader than described in either statement.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, primarily addressing procedural irregularities like violations of natural justice or concerns about judicial bias.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 142, enabling it to address situations where a review petition has been rejected but significant errors of law or procedural violations have occurred, potentially leading to a miscarriage of justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the nature and purpose of curative petitions. Statement 1 correctly describes the curative petition as the final recourse after the review petition's dismissal, focusing on situations involving procedural flaws, violations of natural justice, or perceived bias.  Statement 2 correctly identifies Article 142 as the constitutional basis for the Supreme Court's power to hear such petitions, emphasizing the potential for rectifying serious errors that could result in a miscarriage of justice.  Both statements provide a balanced and accurate representation of the legal aspects of curative petitions.


**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched as a centrally sponsored scheme in 2019 and extended until 2026, FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments and focus solely on cases involving the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  FTSCs aim to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases, with a significant number of these courts operational across various states and union territories, funded through the Nirbhaya Fund managed by the Department of Justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the launch date and extension are accurate, FTSCs are *centrally* sponsored, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the funding, and they handle cases beyond just the POCSO Act; they also address rape cases.  Statement 2 is correct.  The objective of expediting cases, the operational status across states/UTs, and the funding source (Nirbhaya Fund under the Department of Justice) are all accurate.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 make (b) the correct option.


**8. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar, a 12-digit unique identification number, includes details such as caste, religion, income, and health status of the resident, acting as definitive proof of citizenship and domicile.
2.  The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes, but the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment clarified that it is not compulsory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile/internet connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar does *not* contain details like caste, religion, income, or health status.  It is a unique identification number, not proof of citizenship or domicile.  Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced for other services like bank accounts or mobile connections.  The errors in statement 1 make (b) the correct option.


**9. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are schemes funded entirely by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed under the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, aiming to rationalize these schemes and improve their efficiency and effectiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the center.  They are implemented by states, but the sectors involved can be in both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.  Statement 2 is correct.  The 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers formed the basis of the current CSS framework, aiming for rationalization and improved performance.  The inaccuracy in statement 1 makes (b) the correct answer.


**10. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAA grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants belonging to any religious community who entered India before December 31, 2014, from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan, irrespective of their presence in tribal areas or areas under Inner Line Permits.
2.  The CAA exempts specified illegal migrants from penalties under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920, and the Foreigners Act, 1946, reducing the naturalization period to five years for those meeting the specified criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA only applies to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian migrants, excluding others.  It also specifies exclusions for certain tribal areas and areas under Inner Line Permits.  Statement 2 is correct. The CAA provides exemptions from penalties and reduces the naturalization period as stated. The inaccuracies in statement 1 make (b) the correct answer.


**11. With reference to Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards, consider the following statements:**

1.  OCI cardholders enjoy all the rights and privileges of Indian citizens, including the right to vote and hold public office, except for certain restrictions specified by the Ministry of External Affairs.
2.  The Ministry of External Affairs has clarified that the existing rules and regulations governing OCI cards remain unchanged, despite concerns regarding their potential reclassification as foreigners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. OCI cardholders do *not* enjoy all the rights of Indian citizens; they lack voting rights and the right to hold public office.  Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of External Affairs has indeed clarified the unchanged status of OCI regulations.  The inaccuracy in statement 1 makes (b) the correct answer.


**12. With reference to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  In the FPTP system, a party may win more seats than its vote share indicates, while in the PR system, seat distribution is strictly proportional to the vote share, ensuring fair representation for all parties.
2.  The FPTP system is simpler to understand and leads to stable governments, whereas PR systems, while ensuring fairer representation of smaller parties, can lead to coalition governments and potential instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately contrast the FPTP and PR systems. Statement 1 correctly highlights the potential disproportionate seat allocation in FPTP versus the proportional representation in PR systems. Statement 2 accurately points out the simplicity and stability advantages of FPTP, while acknowledging the potential for coalition governments and instability under PR.  Both statements offer a valid comparison of the two electoral systems.


**13. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Public Accounts Committee (PAC), established in 1921, comprises members solely from the Lok Sabha, auditing the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India.
2.  The Estimates Committee, first formed in 1950, consists of members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, examining government expenditure and suggesting improvements in administrative efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect as the PAC includes members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Estimates Committee consists only of Lok Sabha members.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate.


**14. With reference to the Lokpal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lokpal's inquiry wing, headed by the Director of Inquiry, conducts preliminary inquiries into offenses alleged against public servants, punishable under the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), 1988, and submits reports within 30 days.
2.  The Lokpal's prosecution wing, headed by the Director of Prosecution, files cases based on investigation reports before Special Courts, prosecuting public servants for offences under the PCA, 1988, and has the power to supersede any central investigation agency, including the CBI, in cases referred to it.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  The time limit for submission of inquiry reports is 60 days, not 30.  Statement 2 is largely correct, accurately portraying the prosecution wing's functions and the Lokpal's power to direct central investigation agencies.  The partial inaccuracy in statement 1 makes option (b) the most appropriate answer.


**15. With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NCBC's primary function is to examine complaints regarding the inclusion or exclusion of communities from the list of Other Backward Classes (OBCs), solely focusing on socio-economic criteria for this determination.
2.  The NCBC's recommendations regarding OBC status are binding on the central and state governments, with no scope for reconsideration or appeal against its decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The NCBC's role extends beyond just examining complaints; it also advises on OBC-related matters, and socio-economic criteria are not the sole determinant of OBC status.  Also, the NCBC's recommendations are not binding; they are advisory in nature.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the NCBC's functions and powers.


**16. With reference to Passports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports is solely the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs, with no other government agency involved in the process, and only Indian citizens are eligible to receive passports.
2.  Three classes of passports are issued in India: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon), with the Central Government retaining the discretion to issue passports to non-citizens in specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of External Affairs plays a central role, other agencies are involved in passport issuance. Also, the government can issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest.  Statement 2 is correct, accurately describing the three passport classes and the government's discretionary power.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 make (b) the correct answer.


**17. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs, established as part of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), exclusively serve rural citizens, providing only government-to-citizen (G2C) services, such as Aadhaar services and ITR filing.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), overseen by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, aims to expand the reach of CSCs to urban areas, offering a range of services, including G2C, business-to-consumer (B2C), and financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs serve both rural and urban areas, and their services extend beyond G2C to include B2C and financial services.  Statement 2 is correct.  The CSC SPV's aims and the range of services offered are accurately described. The inaccuracies in statement 1 make (b) the correct answer.


**18. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), ranks countries based solely on the number of journalists killed or imprisoned in each country during the reporting period.
2.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 reflects concerns about press freedom, including issues related to media censorship, threats to journalists, and a lack of accountability for attacks against the press.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI ranking considers various factors affecting press freedom, not only the number of journalists killed or imprisoned.  Statement 2 is correct.  India's ranking reflects concerns about various aspects of press freedom as described.  The inaccuracy in statement 1 makes (b) the correct answer.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the distribution of taxes between the Union and States in India:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the share of divisible pool allocated to states, currently standing at 41% based on the 15th FC's recommendations.
2.  Horizontal devolution, as per the 15th FC, prioritizes income distance over population size in distributing funds among states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 270 of the Indian Constitution deals with the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending this distribution.  The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  This is a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While income distance is a factor considered in horizontal devolution (distribution among states), it does not prioritize income distance *over* population. The 15th Finance Commission used a multi-criteria approach, assigning weights to various factors including income distance (45%), area (15%), population (15%), demographic performance (12.5%), forest and ecology (10%), and tax and fiscal efforts (2.5%). Population is a significant factor, not overshadowed by income distance.  The question attempts to create a false dichotomy by implying an exclusive prioritization.


**2. With reference to the borrowing powers of the Union and State Governments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 293 permits state governments to borrow money both within and outside India.
2.  If a state is indebted to the Union, it requires the Union's consent before undertaking further borrowing, regardless of the source of funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing outside India. They can only borrow within the country. The statement wrongly expands the scope of Article 293.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 293 stipulates that if a state government is indebted to the Union government, it cannot further borrow without the Union government's prior consent. This provision is designed to prevent excessive indebtedness and maintain fiscal discipline among states.  The condition applies regardless of whether the new borrowing is from domestic or international sources, as the primary concern is the state's overall debt burden relative to its capacity to repay.


**3. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria and process for granting Special Category Status to states.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants to SCS states before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* explicitly define the criteria or process for granting Special Category Status.  SCS was a political classification, not a constitutional mandate. This classification was based on socio-economic and geographical factors, and the criteria were subject to change depending on the Finance Commission's recommendations and government policies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the mechanism used to allocate funds to states with Special Category Status prior to the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, which effectively ended the formal SCS classification. The formula considered various factors to determine the financial assistance provided to these states.


**4. With reference to the Finance Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations on the divisible pool share for states were based solely on population data from the 2011 census.
2.  Article 280 of the Constitution mandates the establishment of a Finance Commission every five years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission, while considering population data from the 2011 census, did not base its recommendations solely on this factor. Its recommendations for the divisible pool share for states were a result of a multi-criteria approach, weighing various factors such as population, area, income distance, demographic performance, forest cover, and tax effort.  The question attempts to oversimplify the commission's complex methodology.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 280 of the Constitution does mandate the establishment of a Finance Commission, but it does not specify a fixed five-year interval.  The frequency of establishing Finance Commissions has varied over time, reflecting changing fiscal needs and political priorities. The question presents an incorrect, rigid interpretation of the constitutional provision.


**5. With reference to the status of state finances in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  States typically fund over 70% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources.
2.  The debt-to-GDP ratio of states has consistently exceeded 30% since 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  States typically fund *less* than 70% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources.  A significant portion of state finances relies on grants and transfers from the central government. The statement presents a misleadingly optimistic picture of state fiscal autonomy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While state debt-to-GDP ratios are a concern, the statement that it consistently exceeded 30% since 2020 is an overstatement. The precise figure fluctuates and is subject to various factors, and may not always exceed 30%. The statement presents an imprecise and potentially inaccurate claim, making it unreliable.  Specific data should be consulted for accurate assessment.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule grants autonomous status to tribal areas within the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.
2.  The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were the primary basis for the inclusion of the Sixth Schedule in the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule does pertain to the administration of tribal areas, the listed states are not entirely accurate.  The Sixth Schedule applies to tribal areas in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura, not Mizoram. It does not grant full autonomy, but rather provides for a unique system of governance through autonomous district councils. The statement is inaccurate in its inclusion of Mizoram and the extent of autonomy granted.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were indeed instrumental in shaping the provisions of the Sixth Schedule in the Indian Constitution. The committee's work informed the structure and design of the autonomous district councils and other mechanisms for administering tribal areas. The question aims to confuse the examinee with an incorrect list of states while keeping the core fact correct.


**7. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI Director's tenure is fixed at five years, regardless of any extensions.
2. The CBI is a statutory body established under the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CBI Director's tenure is not fixed at five years.  While there have been attempts to extend the tenure beyond the initial term, it is not a permanent five-year appointment, and amendments have been made to the process of appointment and tenure. The statement gives an inaccurate and misleading representation of the CBI Director's tenure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBI is *not* a constitutional body. It's a non-statutory body governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.  The question attempts to mislead the candidate by presenting a false claim about the CBI's constitutional status.


**8. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC has statutory backing, making violations punishable under criminal law.
2. The MCC applies only during the period between the announcement of election schedules and the declaration of results.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC does *not* have statutory backing. It's a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with political parties. While violations can lead to actions under other relevant laws (like the Representation of the People Act), the MCC itself is not a legally enforceable statute.  The statement misrepresents the legal standing of the MCC.

Statement 2 is correct. The MCC is indeed operational from the announcement of election schedules until the declaration of results.  This period is crucial for ensuring a level playing field during elections and preventing any undue influence or malpractices. The question contrasts a false claim about the legal nature of the MCC with a true statement about its timeframe.


**9. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are heard by the Supreme Court of India.
2. The DPBI is empowered to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for non-compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against DPBI decisions are not heard by the Supreme Court.  The appellate authority is the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). The statement deliberately misdirects the candidate to a higher court of appeal.

Statement 2 is correct. The DPBI does have the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for non-compliance with data protection regulations. This is a crucial aspect of its mandate to enforce data protection laws and ensure accountability. The question uses a false appellate authority to contrast with the true enforcement powers of DPBI.


**10. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).
2. The campaign uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) for identifying thematic development gaps at the Gram Sabha level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GPDPs are a significant component, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's scope extends beyond GPDPs to encompass Block Panchayat Development Plans and District Panchayat Development Plans. The campaign aims for a holistic approach to development planning at all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions. The question misrepresents the campaign's scope to confuse the examinee.

Statement 2 is correct. The campaign does utilize the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic development gaps at the Gram Sabha level. This index helps in a targeted and data-driven approach to planning. The question attempts to mask this correct fact by adding a false claim about the scope of the campaign.


**11. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly audits the accounts of all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is used for online auditing of all local body accounts, ensuring 100% online accountability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG has oversight, it doesn't directly audit all accounts of all three tiers of PRIs and ULBs.  It exercises control and supervision, often through Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level. The statement simplifies the complex multi-layered auditing process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The AuditOnline application is a significant step towards online auditing, but it does not cover all local body accounts and does not ensure 100% online accountability.  The statement makes an exaggerated claim about the application's reach and effectiveness. The question presents an oversimplified and inaccurate view of the auditing process and technology.


**12. With reference to Mercy Petitions and Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the last available legal remedy after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court.
2. The President of India can reject a mercy petition only if the convict was sentenced by a court-martial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the final legal recourse available to a person after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court. This petition addresses exceptional circumstances and significant errors of justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., as per Article 72, extends beyond sentences by court-martial.  The President can consider mercy petitions for offences under various laws where the executive power of the Union extends, including sentences of death. The statement restricts the President's power to an incorrect situation, creating a distractor for the examinee.


**13. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are exclusively dedicated to handling POCSO Act cases.
2. The FTSCs are funded entirely by the respective state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While many FTSCs handle POCSO Act cases, they are not exclusively dedicated to them.  They also address other serious crimes like rape cases.  The statement wrongly implies exclusive jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  FTSCs are funded under a centrally sponsored scheme, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund. While states may contribute, the funding is not solely from state government resources.  The statement gives a false impression of the funding source. The question combines two false claims related to the functioning and finance of FTSCs.


**14. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, does not apply to international commercial arbitrations.
2. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre (NDIAC) was established primarily to handle domestic arbitration cases exclusively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, *does* apply to international commercial arbitrations, provided certain conditions are met.  The statement falsely limits the Act's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NDIAC was set up to facilitate *international* commercial arbitration, aiming to make India a preferred destination for such proceedings. It is not limited to domestic cases.  The statement gives a false characterization of NDIAC's mandate. The question combines two incorrect statements about the application and purpose of ADR institutions in India.



**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states based on various criteria including income distance, area, and population.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  This vertical devolution is based on a weighted average of several factors, including income distance, area, population (2011 census), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  The specific weights assigned to each criterion are part of the Commission's detailed recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They are permitted to borrow only within the country.  The Union government, however, has the power to borrow both domestically and internationally (Article 292).  This difference reflects the asymmetrical power balance in the federal structure, with the Union government having greater financial flexibility.  The restriction on state borrowing aims to prevent undue financial risk and maintain macroeconomic stability.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The grant of Special Category Status is constitutionally mandated under Article 370.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state has been granted SCS since.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not contain any provision explicitly mentioning or providing for Special Category Status (SCS).  The granting of SCS has been a policy decision based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions and other governmental bodies, considering socio-economic and geographical factors.  Article 370, which dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, is a separate provision and is no longer operative.

Statement 2 is correct.  On the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the system of granting Special Category Status was effectively abolished. While some states might receive special financial assistance through different mechanisms, the formal categorization of states as "Special Category States" no longer exists. This shift aimed to create a more uniform and equitable system of resource allocation, moving away from the potentially discriminatory nature of the earlier SCS framework.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented by state governments.
2.  Following the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017, CSSs became the primary mode of specific purpose transfers from the Union to the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  While the central government provides a significant portion of the funding, states also contribute, reflecting the collaborative nature of these schemes. The implementation is primarily carried out by state governments, but the central government maintains oversight and guidance.

Statement 2 is correct. The abolition of the Plan-Non Plan budgetary classification in 2017, a key recommendation of the 14th Finance Commission, significantly altered the landscape of central-state financial relations.  CSSs and Central Sector Schemes became the main vehicles for specific-purpose transfers from the Union to the states, streamlining the process and creating a more unified approach to resource allocation.  This change aimed to improve efficiency and transparency in the allocation and utilization of funds.


**4.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi is a capacity-building initiative exclusively for elected representatives at the state level.
2.  One of the guiding principles of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi is a capacity-building initiative for all civil servants (including contractual employees) across various ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies of the Union Government.  It does not focus solely on elected representatives or the state level.  The goal is to enhance the professional capabilities and effectiveness of the entire civil service.

Statement 2 is correct.  A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is to transition from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building.  This involves focusing on the actual roles and responsibilities of civil servants, developing competencies relevant to their specific tasks, rather than merely adhering to a prescribed set of rules and regulations.  The competency-driven approach is intended to create a more agile, responsive, and effective civil service better equipped to meet the challenges of modern governance.


**5.  With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is overseen by the Ministry of Rural Development.
2.  CSCs are primarily designed to deliver government services to urban citizens in an integrated manner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), which oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme, is under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This reflects the technological focus of the program, leveraging IT infrastructure to deliver services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CSCs are designed to deliver government, private, and social sector services to rural citizens of India in an integrated manner.  The aim is to bridge the digital divide and provide access to essential services in underserved rural areas. While some CSCs might cater to urban areas, their primary focus and reach are rural communities.  The pan-India network aims to address the diverse regional, geographic, linguistic, and cultural contexts of the country.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI):**

1.  The DPBI has the power to impose penalties for data breaches but cannot direct data fiduciaries to take remedial measures.
2.  Appeals against the DPBI's decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) does have the power to impose penalties for non-compliance with data protection regulations, including data breaches.  Importantly, it also has the authority to direct data fiduciaries to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach, ensuring that appropriate remedial actions are taken to mitigate the impact and prevent future occurrences.

Statement 2 is correct. Appeals against the decisions of the DPBI are channeled through the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). This provides an avenue for redressal and ensures that the DPBI's decisions are subject to independent review and scrutiny.  The TDSAT's jurisdiction in this matter reflects the broader regulatory framework governing data protection and telecommunications in India.


**7. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FCRA mandates prior permission for receiving foreign funds, but Aadhaar submission is not required from office-bearers of NGOs.
2.  The FCRA allows the use of foreign funds for any purpose, provided it aligns with the NGO's objectives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FCRA does mandate prior permission for receiving foreign funds and requires registration with mandatory Aadhaar submission for every office-bearer of NGOs seeking to receive foreign funds.  This requirement aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the handling of foreign contributions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FCRA restricts the use of foreign funds to the specific purposes for which they were received.  There are limitations on how much of the foreign contribution can be used for administrative expenses (currently a maximum of 20%).  The act aims to prevent misuse of foreign funds and ensure that they are used in accordance with the stated objectives of the receiving organization.  The government's oversight and regulatory mechanisms aim to ensure compliance with these provisions.


**8. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Post Office Act, 2023, repealed the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
2.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) appointed under the 2023 Act has the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services and the sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Post Office Act, 2023, repealed the Indian Post Office Act, 1998, not the Act of 1898.  The 1998 Act had been in effect for several years before being replaced by the 2023 legislation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS), appointed under the Post Office Act, 2023, is granted the authority to formulate regulations concerning various aspects of postal services. This includes setting charges for services, overseeing the supply and sale of postage stamps, and other matters related to the efficient operation of the postal system.  This delegation of regulatory power aims to streamline the management and governance of India Post.


**9. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar captures details like caste, religion, income, health, and geography of the residents.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared Aadhaar mandatory for opening bank accounts and mobile connections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar, as a biometric identification system, does *not* capture details such as caste, religion, income, health, or precise geographical location.  It primarily stores biometric data (fingerprints, iris scans) and demographic information (name, address, date of birth) for authentication purposes.  The design prioritizes privacy by excluding sensitive personal information.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but explicitly stated that Aadhaar cannot be made mandatory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  While it affirmed the use of Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes, it emphasized the importance of protecting individual privacy rights.  The ruling clarified the scope of Aadhaar's application and its limitations regarding mandatory usage for non-welfare services.


**10. With reference to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules mandate the immediate arrest of any individual suspected of using unfair means in a public examination.
2.  The rules provide for the constitution of a committee by the public examination authority if there is involvement of the management or board of directors of a service provider in any unfair means.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, do not mandate immediate arrest. The rules empower the venue-in-charge to take appropriate action, which *may* include filing a First Information Report (FIR) if a prima facie case of unfair means or an offense is reported.  The decision to arrest rests with the law enforcement agencies based on the evidence presented.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules clearly stipulate that if the management or board of directors of a service provider (any agency involved in conducting the examination) is implicated in unfair means, a committee must be constituted by the public examination authority to investigate the matter. This provision highlights the importance of holding all stakeholders accountable for maintaining the integrity of public examinations.  The committee's role is crucial in ensuring a thorough and impartial inquiry into the alleged misconduct.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas,' aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign exclusively focuses on Gram Sabha level planning, excluding the involvement of Block and District Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, initially launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is aimed at enhancing people's participation in the creation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  This initiative emphasizes a bottom-up approach to planning, ensuring local needs and priorities are incorporated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gram Sabhas are a crucial component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, the campaign's scope extends beyond the Gram Panchayat level. It actively involves all three tiers of Panchayats—Gram, Block, and District—in the planning process.  The structured Ward Sabha/Mahila Sabha/Gram Sabha/Block Sabha/District Sabha format explicitly demonstrates this multi-tiered approach, ensuring comprehensive participation and planning across different administrative levels. The involvement of elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations at all levels further reinforces this inclusive strategy.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such center globally, aiming to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance.
2.  iCAL's establishment is primarily driven by the need to address the lack of transparency and accountability in the financial management of local bodies in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While iCAL is indeed the first such center in India,  the claim that it is the first globally is inaccurate.  Other international organizations and initiatives focus on improving the auditing of local governance.  iCAL's significance lies in its potential to set new standards for auditing within India and potentially influence practices in similar contexts.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of iCAL is a significant step towards enhancing transparency and accountability in the financial management of local bodies in India. The initiative aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of audits, promoting better governance and resource utilization.  The lack of standardized auditing practices and capacity constraints within local bodies underscore the need for such a specialized center.


**3. With reference to the Devolution of Funds to States, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vertical devolution, currently at 41%, represents the share of states from the divisible pool of taxes, determined by the Finance Commission, while horizontal devolution allocates this share among states based on factors like population and area.
2.  The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations exclusively focused on vertical devolution, neglecting horizontal considerations in resource allocation among states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes allocated to states from the central government. The 15th Finance Commission recommended 41% for this. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, focuses on distributing this allocated share among various states, considering factors such as income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts. This ensures a fairer distribution of resources, addressing disparities among states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission explicitly addressed both vertical and horizontal devolution.  It not only determined the overall share of states from the divisible pool (vertical devolution) but also defined the criteria and weightage for distributing that share among the states (horizontal devolution).  The specific criteria mentioned in the passage demonstrate a multifaceted approach to resource allocation.


**4. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was initially introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, providing special financial assistance to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
2.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS categorization was abolished, and all states now receive funding under a uniform framework.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Special Category Status (SCS) was indeed introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.  The aim was to provide additional support to states grappling with unique challenges related to geography, socio-economic conditions, and developmental needs.  This involved providing special financial assistance and other benefits.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS categorization.  While special provisions continue for some states, particularly in the Northeast and Himalayan regions, these are based on different criteria and funding mechanisms rather than the formal SCS designation. The move was aimed at creating a more uniform and transparent system of resource allocation.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, implemented by states, and primarily focus on sectors listed in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, emphasizing schemes aligned with the national development agenda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are indeed joint ventures between the central and state governments. States implement these schemes, with funding shared between the two levels.  The focus areas typically fall under the State and Concurrent Lists in the Constitution, reflecting the shared responsibilities of the Centre and States in various developmental sectors.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The current structure of CSSs is indeed shaped by the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs. This report advocated for streamlining CSSs and aligning them with the national development agenda, improving efficiency and coordination between the Centre and States in implementing key developmental initiatives.  This rationalization aimed to optimize resource allocation and ensure better outcomes.


**6. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi, launched under the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), aims to transform the civil service into a future-ready, professional workforce aligned with India's developmental goals.
2.  Mission Karmayogi's training and capacity-building initiatives exclusively target senior-level bureaucrats, excluding junior and middle-level civil servants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Mission Karmayogi, a crucial component of the NPCSCB, is designed to modernize and enhance the capabilities of the Indian civil service.  The initiative seeks to create a workforce that is adaptable, skilled, and effectively equipped to address the challenges and opportunities of India's development trajectory. It focuses on creating a professional, well-trained, and future-looking civil service.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi's scope is comprehensive, encompassing all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies of the Union Government.  The initiative is not limited to senior officials but aims to improve the skills and competencies of civil servants at all levels.  This inclusive approach is crucial for achieving a holistic transformation of the civil service.


**7.  With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPBI's key functions include monitoring compliance with the data protection law, imposing penalties for violations, and addressing grievances from affected individuals.
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are handled by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) plays a crucial role in enforcing data protection regulations. Its responsibilities include monitoring compliance, imposing penalties on those who violate the law, and providing a mechanism for individuals to raise and resolve grievances related to data protection. This ensures accountability and protects the rights of data principals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are not handled by the Supreme Court of India. Instead, the designated appellate body is the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). This reflects the specialized nature of data protection disputes and the need for a tribunal with expertise in this area.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, enshrined under Article 244(2), was established based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, granting autonomy to tribal areas in specific states.
2. The Sixth Schedule's provisions apply uniformly across all states with significant tribal populations in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, as outlined under Article 244(2), was indeed formulated based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.  It aims to provide a degree of self-governance and autonomy to tribal areas within specific states, recognizing their unique socio-cultural contexts and developmental needs.  This is achieved through the establishment of autonomous district councils and other mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's application is not uniform across all states with significant tribal populations. It applies only to specific states—Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram—where autonomous district councils are established under its provisions.  Other states with substantial tribal populations have different mechanisms for addressing their specific governance and administrative needs.


**9. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offenses under Union laws.
2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and cannot be challenged in any court of law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute sentences for a broader range of offenses than just those under Union laws.  It includes offenses under both Union and State laws, as well as sentences awarded by court-martials.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President's decision on a mercy petition carries significant weight, it is not entirely unchallengeable.  Judicial review, while limited, can be invoked in exceptional circumstances to address potential procedural irregularities or fundamental rights violations in the process of granting or rejecting a mercy petition.  The courts may not directly overturn the President's decision but can scrutinize the process.


**10. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the final legal remedy available to an individual whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, addressing issues such as procedural irregularities or violations of natural justice.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort for individuals whose review petitions have been rejected by the Supreme Court.  It serves as a mechanism to address exceptional circumstances, such as significant procedural lapses or violations of principles of natural justice during the earlier stages of the judicial process.  It provides a final opportunity to seek redress for such irregularities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not explicitly mention the power to entertain curative petitions.  This power is derived from the Supreme Court's inherent jurisdiction under Article 142, which enables it to do complete justice in a case.  The curative petition mechanism, developed through judicial precedent, serves to ensure that the court's inherent powers are used responsibly and judiciously to address exceptional situations.


**11. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs, established as a centrally sponsored scheme, are primarily focused on expediting the disposal of rape cases and those related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments, reflecting their primary responsibility for ensuring justice in such cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FTSCs are indeed a centrally sponsored scheme primarily designed to expedite the trial and disposal of rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act.  The aim is to ensure swift justice for victims and reduce the backlog of cases in the judicial system. This reflects the seriousness with which these crimes are viewed and the urgency to provide timely justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs are not funded entirely by state governments.  The central government bears the expenditure for these courts, primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund.  This reflects the central government's commitment to addressing these crimes nationwide and ensuring consistent standards in their prosecution.  State governments play a role in implementation, but the primary funding comes from the Centre.


**12. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), consider the following statements:**

1. ADR mechanisms, such as mediation and arbitration, offer an alternative to traditional court proceedings for resolving various disputes, including commercial, civil, and family matters.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which incorporates elements of the UNCITRAL Model Law, is exclusively applicable to international commercial arbitrations in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms encompass various methods of resolving disputes outside of formal court proceedings.  These include mediation, arbitration, conciliation, and negotiation.  ADR is applicable to a wide spectrum of disputes, including commercial, civil, family, and other types of conflicts.  It offers a more efficient and often less adversarial approach to dispute resolution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, while incorporating aspects of the UNCITRAL Model Law, is not limited to international commercial arbitrations.  It applies to domestic arbitrations as well, covering a broad range of commercial and other disputes within India. The Act's comprehensive nature underscores its importance in facilitating efficient dispute resolution within the country.



**1. With reference to the President's address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Originally, Article 87(1) mandated the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.
2.  The practice of the President addressing Parliament at the beginning of the first session after each general election was established after the promulgation of the Indian Independence Act, 1947.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 87(1) initially required the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the start of each session. This was later amended by the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, allowing for flexibility in the timing and frequency of such addresses. The amendment reflected a pragmatic approach, recognizing the evolving needs of parliamentary proceedings and the potential for scheduling conflicts.  The original provision aimed to ensure the President's direct engagement with the legislature at the outset of every legislative session, emphasizing the executive's role in setting the legislative agenda and maintaining a close relationship with the Parliament.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The practice of the President addressing Parliament at the beginning of the first session following a general election is a convention evolved over time, not directly linked to the Indian Independence Act, 1947. While the Act laid the foundation for India's independent governance structure, the specific practice of the presidential address at the commencement of the first session after a general election developed organically as a part of established parliamentary norms. This practice serves to highlight the newly elected government's policy priorities and legislative plans for the upcoming term.  The Independence Act focused primarily on the transfer of power and the establishment of the dominion status, not on the precise details of parliamentary procedures.


**2. With reference to the Oath of Members of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 99 stipulates that the oaths of office for MPs must be administered before the President or a designated individual appointed by the President, and the forms of these oaths are detailed in the Third Schedule.
2.  A Member of Parliament can participate in parliamentary proceedings without having taken the oath, provided they are a newly appointed minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Article 99 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for administering the oaths of office to Members of Parliament. It mandates that these oaths be taken before the President or an individual appointed by the President for this purpose. The specific wording of these oaths is prescribed in the Third Schedule of the Constitution, ensuring uniformity and adherence to established constitutional norms.  This process underscores the solemnity and significance of assuming the office of an MP and emphasizes the oath's role in upholding constitutional principles and responsibilities.

Statement 2 is also correct.  While Article 104 mandates that a member who has not taken the oath cannot participate in the House's proceedings, there is an exception for newly appointed ministers who haven't been elected to Parliament.  This exception acknowledges the practical necessity of allowing individuals appointed to ministerial positions to actively participate in legislative processes, even before they have completed the formal oath-taking process as an elected member. This exception is a temporary measure until they are duly elected to Parliament and take their oaths.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act lays down five ways of acquiring Indian citizenship: birth, descent, registration, naturalization, and incorporation of territory.
2.  The Citizenship Act, 1955, explicitly allows for dual citizenship.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Citizenship Act of 1955 meticulously details the five distinct pathways to acquiring Indian citizenship. These include birth within Indian territory (jus soli), descent from Indian citizens (jus sanguinis), registration under specified conditions, naturalization after meeting specific residency and character requirements, and the incorporation of territory into the Indian Union.  This comprehensive approach reflects the legal framework for determining citizenship based on various criteria and circumstances.  The Act's detailed provisions are designed to ensure clarity and prevent ambiguity in determining citizenship status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Citizenship Act, 1955, does *not* provide for dual citizenship.  India follows a principle of single citizenship, meaning an individual can hold citizenship of only one country.  While some countries permit dual citizenship, India's legal framework maintains a singular citizenship status, reflecting a policy decision prioritizing national identity and allegiance.  The absence of dual citizenship in the Act is a deliberate policy choice, aiming to establish a clear and unambiguous framework for national belonging and avoiding potential complexities associated with multiple citizenships.


**4. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to commute a death sentence only if the conviction is from a court-martial.
2. The President's power to grant pardons extends to offenses under both Union and State laws.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense (including death sentences), it is not limited to court-martial convictions. The President's power extends to all types of offenses falling under the Union's executive power, including those tried in civil courts.  The scope of the President's clemency power is broad, encompassing various forms of relief from punishment and covering a wide range of offenses.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the punishment inflicted on any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. This includes offenses under both Union and State laws, encompassing a wide spectrum of criminal activities. The President's clemency power extends to all offenses within the ambit of the Union's executive authority, underscoring the executive's role in mitigating punishment and ensuring justice.  This power acts as a check and balance within the judicial system.


**5. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the final legal recourse available after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition serves as the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition (under Article 137) has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  This exceptional remedy addresses situations where there may have been significant procedural irregularities or a demonstrable miscarriage of justice.  The curative petition mechanism provides a safety valve against irreversible judicial errors.  It is an extraordinary remedy, and the Supreme Court exercises its discretion cautiously in entertaining such petitions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's authority to hear curative petitions originates from its inherent powers under Article 142, which enables it to ensure complete justice in any case before it.  This constitutional provision grants the Supreme Court the power to issue orders or directions necessary for doing complete justice. The curative petition mechanism falls under this broader power, providing a means for rectifying grave judicial errors and preventing irreversible injustices. The Supreme Court's exercise of this power is guided by principles of fairness and the need to uphold the integrity of the judicial process.


**6. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established as a centrally sponsored scheme, funded entirely by the states, to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.
2.  FTSCs are linked to the National Judicial Data Grid.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at accelerating the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases, their funding is primarily borne by the central government, utilizing funds from the Nirbhaya Fund. This central funding reflects the national importance attached to addressing sexual violence effectively and efficiently.  The scheme's central sponsorship ensures uniform implementation across states and helps overcome resource constraints that might otherwise hinder the efficient functioning of these specialized courts.

Statement 2 is correct.  FTSCs are indeed linked to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG). This linkage facilitates the electronic tracking and monitoring of cases, enhancing transparency and accountability. The NJDG integration allows for real-time data updates on case status, improving the efficiency of case management and providing valuable insights into the overall performance of FTSCs.  The integration with NJDG is a crucial aspect of modernizing the judicial system and ensuring efficient data management.


**7. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
2. The Station Commander of a Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, but this Act is aligned with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, not the 73rd. The 74th Amendment deals with urban local bodies, and the administration of cantonments, while having some overlap with civic functions, falls under the Union List, reflecting the unique nature of these military-civilian areas.  The alignment with the 74th Amendment reflects the incorporation of certain aspects of local governance into the management of cantonments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This reflects the military's significant role in the administration and governance of these areas.  The Station Commander's presidency ensures military oversight and coordination within the cantonment's administration.  This arrangement is consistent with the unique character of cantonments as areas with a substantial military presence alongside a civilian population.


**8. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a fundamental right under Article 21 only.
2.  The Supreme Court's expansion of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns primarily utilizes Articles 14 and 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has linked the right to a healthy environment to fundamental rights, it hasn't limited it to Article 21 alone.  The Court's approach involves interpreting fundamental rights broadly to encompass the right to a healthy environment.  This interpretation isn't confined to a single article but uses a combination of relevant articles to establish the right.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's jurisprudence on environmental protection frequently relies on Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life and personal liberty).  Article 14 is used to ensure equitable distribution of environmental benefits and burdens, while Article 21 is interpreted to include the right to a healthy environment as an essential component of the right to life.  The Court has progressively expanded the scope of these articles to address environmental concerns, recognizing the interconnectedness between environmental health and human well-being.  This approach reflects a proactive judicial engagement with environmental issues.


**9. With reference to Administrative Tribunals, consider the following statements:**

1. Administrative Tribunals were introduced through the 44th Constitutional Amendment Act of 1978.
2. Administrative Tribunals are empowered to resolve disputes related to taxation and land reforms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Administrative Tribunals were introduced through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act of 1976, not the 44th. The 42nd Amendment added Articles 323A and 323B to the Constitution, establishing the framework for the creation of administrative tribunals at both the central and state levels.  The introduction of administrative tribunals aimed to provide an alternative, specialized mechanism for resolving disputes related to government actions and policies.

Statement 2 is correct.  Administrative Tribunals have jurisdiction over disputes and complaints relating to a wide range of matters, including taxation and land reforms.  These tribunals are designed to handle such disputes efficiently and cost-effectively, reducing the burden on regular courts.  The scope of their jurisdiction is defined by the specific legislation establishing each tribunal, allowing for specialization and efficient resolution of administrative matters.


**10. With reference to Bail provisions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Section 479 of the Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, states that the maximum period of pre-trial detention for an undertrial prisoner cannot exceed half of the maximum sentence for the offense.
2.  The BNSS, 2023 introduces a time-bound plea bargaining process where applications must be filed within 30 days of the framing of charges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Section 479 of the BNSS, 2023, indeed sets a limit on the maximum period of pre-trial detention for undertrial prisoners. This limit is capped at one-half of the maximum sentence prescribed for the offense. This provision aims to prevent prolonged detention without trial, upholding the principle that bail is the rule and jail is the exception.  The provision is a significant reform aimed at ensuring fair treatment of undertrial prisoners.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The BNSS, 2023, introduces a time-bound framework for plea bargaining, requiring applications to be filed within 30 days of the framing of charges.  This time limit aims to enhance the efficiency and predictability of the plea bargaining process.  The time-bound nature of this process is designed to prevent undue delays and to provide clarity and certainty to both the prosecution and the accused.  This aspect aims to streamline the judicial process and promote more expeditious resolution of cases.


**11. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of the 10th Schedule (Anti-Defection Law) without any limitations.
2. The 10th Schedule empowers the Speaker/Chairman to decide on membership disqualification based on the grounds of defection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court has largely upheld the constitutionality of the 10th Schedule, it has also imposed certain limitations and guidelines to prevent its misuse. The Court has emphasized the need for impartiality and fairness in the Speaker's/Chairman's decisions on defection cases, ensuring due process and preventing arbitrary actions.  The Court's interventions reflect an effort to strike a balance between upholding the anti-defection law and protecting the rights of legislators.

Statement 2 is correct. The 10th Schedule of the Constitution empowers the Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha to adjudicate on matters related to disqualification of members on grounds of defection.  This power is crucial for maintaining the stability of the government and preventing floor-crossing by elected representatives.  The Speaker's/Chairman's decision, however, is subject to judicial review in case of alleged bias or procedural irregularities.


**12. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act exempts all personal information from disclosure, as per the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023.
2.  Lower courts are prohibited from entertaining suits or applications related to the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The DPDP Act, 2023, has amended Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act to exempt personal information from disclosure.  This amendment reflects the need to balance transparency with the protection of individual privacy rights.  The amendment clarifies the scope of exemptions under the RTI Act, particularly regarding personal data.  The amendment seeks to strike a balance between the public's right to information and the individual's right to privacy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Lower courts are generally barred from entertaining suits or applications concerning the RTI Act.  This is because the RTI Act provides for a specific appellate mechanism within the RTI framework itself.  This provision prevents the clogging of lower courts with RTI-related cases and ensures that such matters are handled within the specialized structure provided by the RTI Act.  The appellate mechanism within the RTI Act ensures efficient and effective resolution of such matters.


**13. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card is considered definitive proof of date of birth.
2.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) can deactivate or delete Aadhaar numbers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aadhaar can be used as a means of identification, it is not considered definitive proof of date of birth by the Supreme Court.  Other documents may be required to verify the date of birth conclusively.  The Supreme Court has clarified that Aadhaar, while a valuable identification tool, does not automatically establish date of birth with absolute certainty.  Additional evidence may be needed depending on the specific context and requirements.

Statement 2 is correct. The UIDAI, as the issuing authority for Aadhaar numbers, retains the power to deactivate or delete Aadhaar numbers under certain circumstances.  This power is necessary to maintain the integrity and security of the Aadhaar database and to address issues such as fraud, duplication, or other irregularities.  The UIDAI's authority to manage Aadhaar numbers is an essential aspect of ensuring the system's accuracy and security.


**14. With reference to Election Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Appeals against decisions on election petitions lie with the High Courts.
2.  An election petition can only be filed by a candidate who contested the election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against the decisions on election petitions lie with the Supreme Court of India, not the High Courts. This reflects the significance of election disputes and the need for a final, authoritative determination at the highest level of the judiciary. The Supreme Court's jurisdiction in this area ensures uniformity and consistency in the interpretation and application of electoral laws.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  An election petition can be filed not only by a candidate who contested the election but also by an elector (a person entitled to vote in that election).  This broader provision ensures that electoral irregularities are challenged, safeguarding the integrity of the electoral process.  The ability of electors to file petitions enhances accountability and prevents potential manipulation of the electoral system.


**15. With reference to Nominations in Elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  Candidates from recognized political parties need ten proposers to file their nominations.
2.  Section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, deals with the scrutiny of nominations and empowers the Returning Officer to reject nominations on grounds of substantial defects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Candidates from recognized political parties only require one proposer to file their nominations, not ten.  Independent candidates and those from unrecognized parties require ten proposers.  This difference in requirements reflects the established position and organizational capacity of recognized political parties.  The lower number of proposers required for candidates from recognized parties reflects the established presence and organizational strength of such parties.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 36 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, indeed deals with the scrutiny of nominations and empowers the Returning Officer to reject nominations that contain substantial defects.  This provision is crucial in ensuring the validity and integrity of the nomination process.  The Returning Officer's power to reject nominations based on substantial defects safeguards the electoral process against fraudulent or flawed nominations.


**16. With reference to Re-polling in Elections, consider the following statements:**

1. Re-polling can be ordered only due to the death of a candidate from a national or state-recognized party.
2.  Damage or destruction of voting machines necessitates re-polling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Re-polling is not limited to the death of a candidate from a recognized political party.  Re-polling can be ordered due to various reasons, including natural calamities, widespread violence, booth capturing, or other significant irregularities that compromise the fairness and integrity of the election.  The decision to order re-polling rests with the Election Commission of India, considering the specific circumstances of each case.

Statement 2 is correct. Damage or destruction of voting machines that significantly affects the voting process is a valid ground for ordering re-polling.  This ensures that the election results are accurate and reflect the genuine will of the voters.  The Election Commission takes appropriate measures to ensure that any malfunction or damage to voting equipment does not compromise the fairness and integrity of the election.


**17. With reference to the Silence Period in Elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The silence period is a mandatory ban on all forms of political campaigning, including social media, before polling day.
2. The length of the silence period is uniformly fixed across all states and union territories in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The silence period mandates a complete ban on all forms of political campaigning, encompassing traditional methods and modern media like social media, before the day of polling.  This period is crucial in providing a level playing field for all candidates and allowing voters to make informed decisions without undue influence.  The silence period is essential for preserving the integrity and fairness of the electoral process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The length of the silence period is not uniformly fixed across all states and union territories. While it is usually 48 hours before polling, variations may exist based on specific circumstances or local regulations. The Election Commission of India has the authority to determine the precise length of the silence period for each election, considering the specific context and logistical aspects of the poll.  The flexibility in setting the duration reflects the need to adapt to various circumstances while maintaining the overall purpose of the silence period.


**18. With reference to Article 3 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 permits Parliament to form new states by separating territory from existing states without any requirement for prior consultation with the state legislatures.
2. Any bill affecting the area, boundaries, or name of a state requires the President's prior recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 3 empowers Parliament to form new states or alter the boundaries or names of existing states, it doesn't permit such actions without any prior consultation.  Before recommending a bill affecting a state's area, boundaries, or name, the President must consult with the state legislature concerned. This provision reflects the importance of involving the affected state in decisions impacting its territorial integrity.  The consultation requirement ensures that the state's views are considered before Parliament takes action.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that any bill involving changes to a state's area, boundaries, or name must be introduced in Parliament only with the President's prior recommendation.  This requirement emphasizes the significant nature of such changes and necessitates careful consideration at the highest executive level.  The President's recommendation serves as a safeguard against arbitrary or hasty decisions concerning state reorganization.


**19. With reference to the State Reorganization Commission/Committees, consider the following statements:**

1.  The S.K. Dhar Commission (1948) recommended state reorganization based primarily on linguistic factors.
2.  The Fazl Ali Commission (1953) recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The S.K. Dhar Commission (1948) primarily recommended state reorganization based on administrative convenience rather than linguistic factors.  This approach reflected a focus on efficient governance and administrative effectiveness.  The commission's recommendation prioritized pragmatic considerations over purely linguistic criteria.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Fazl Ali Commission (1953) indeed recommended the formation of 14 states and 6 Union Territories.  This recommendation was a landmark event in the reorganization of Indian states, significantly shaping the country's administrative and political landscape.  The commission's recommendations were largely accepted by Parliament, resulting in the States Reorganisation Act of 1956.


**20. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases.
2.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases go to the High Court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are designed to provide accessible and efficient justice at the village level.  Their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal cases involving petty disputes.  The establishment of Gram Nyayalayas aims to bring justice closer to the people, particularly in rural areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases go to the District Court, not the High Court.  This is because the Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, and appeals from such courts typically go to the District Court.  The appellate structure reflects the tiered nature of the judicial system, providing for successive levels of review.


**21. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both civil and criminal contempt are defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and the Supreme Court and High Courts have concurrent powers to punish contempt.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience to court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines both civil and criminal contempt.  The Supreme Court and High Courts are vested with the power to punish for contempt, reflecting the judiciary's authority to maintain its own dignity and ensure the proper administration of justice.  This power is essential for the effective functioning of the judicial system.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Civil contempt arises from willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court or interfere with the administration of justice.  The distinction between these two types of contempt reflects the different nature of the acts involved and the appropriate remedies.  Both types of contempt are considered serious offenses that undermine the authority and integrity of the judicial system.


**22. With reference to Zero FIRs, consider the following statements:**

1. A Zero FIR is registered by the police station where the crime is reported, regardless of where the crime actually occurred.
2. The provision for Zero FIRs is a recent addition, introduced in the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A Zero FIR is registered at the police station where the complaint is first lodged, irrespective of the actual location of the crime.  This ensures that the victim's complaint is promptly registered, preventing delays and potential loss of evidence.  The Zero FIR mechanism is designed to facilitate timely registration of complaints and ensure that victims are not turned away due to jurisdictional issues.

Statement 2 is also correct. The provision for Zero FIRs is a relatively recent addition, introduced in the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.  This reflects a shift in approach towards ensuring prompt and effective registration of crime complaints, particularly in cases involving vulnerable individuals.  The introduction of Zero FIRs is a significant reform aiming to improve the responsiveness and accessibility of the police system.


**23. With reference to the Doctrine of Coverture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Coverture is a legal concept originating from English common law, which treated a married woman as a legal entity separate from her husband.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) highlighted the Doctrine of Coverture's relevance in understanding the Marital Rape Exception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture, originating from English common law, did *not* treat a married woman as a separate legal entity from her husband.  Instead, it subsumed the legal existence of a married woman under her husband's, effectively denying her independent legal rights and status.  This concept reflected a patriarchal societal structure where women's legal rights were significantly curtailed upon marriage.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) did indeed highlight the relevance of the Doctrine of Coverture in understanding the Marital Rape Exception (MRE). The Court recognized that the MRE's historical roots lay in the Doctrine of Coverture, which underpinned the idea that a wife did not have the legal capacity to refuse sexual relations with her husband.  The Court's observations in this case underscore the historical context and the patriarchal biases underlying the MRE.


**24. With reference to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction mandates that all sections of a statute must be interpreted literally, without any consideration for contextual meaning.
2. The Supreme Court uses the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to resolve inconsistencies or conflicts between different provisions of a statute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction does *not* mandate a purely literal interpretation of statutes, ignoring contextual meaning.  Instead, it emphasizes interpreting different provisions of a statute in a way that gives effect to all provisions, avoiding contradictions or inconsistencies.  The doctrine aims to provide a coherent and meaningful interpretation of the entire statute.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court frequently employs the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to resolve conflicts or inconsistencies between different provisions of a statute.  This approach prioritizes giving effect to all provisions of the law to the extent possible, seeking a harmonious interpretation that avoids rendering any provision meaningless or redundant.  The doctrine is a vital tool for judicial interpretation in resolving ambiguities and promoting a coherent legal framework.


**1. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister, which includes the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Minister-in-charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs, and the Leaders of the Opposition in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including the authority to summon and examine witnesses, discover and produce documents, and requisition public records.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The NHRC's Chairperson and members are appointed by the President based on the recommendations of a committee chaired by the Prime Minister. This committee includes the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Minister of Home Affairs, the Leaders of the Opposition in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. This reflects the commission's importance and its need for broad political support.

Statement 2 is also correct. The NHRC is granted extensive powers under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. These powers are equivalent to those of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  This enables the NHRC to effectively investigate human rights violations and compel witnesses and the production of evidence.  This is crucial for its investigative and adjudicatory functions.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect as they misrepresent the NHRC's composition and powers.


**2. With reference to the President's address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President is constitutionally mandated to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.
2. The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, altered the provision regarding the President's address to Parliament, making it a requirement only at the beginning of the first session after each general election and at the beginning of the first session of each year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the original Article 87(1) mandated the President to address both Houses at the commencement of every session, this provision was amended.  The initial requirement was considered too frequent and potentially burdensome.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, modified Article 87(1). The amendment reduced the frequency of the President's address, requiring it only at the beginning of the first session following a general election and at the start of the first session each year. This reflects a pragmatic adjustment to the constitutional framework.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the changes brought about by the First Amendment to Article 87(1).


**3. With reference to the oaths of Members of Parliament (MPs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 99 of the Constitution stipulates that MPs must take an oath before the Vice-President of India or a person appointed by him/her.
2.  Article 104 prescribes a penalty for an MP who sits in the House without taking the oath, with an exception for individuals appointed as ministers before being elected to Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 99 mandates that MPs take the oath before the President or a person appointed by the President, not the Vice-President.  This reflects the President's role as the head of state.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 104 outlines penalties for MPs who participate in House proceedings without taking the prescribed oath. However, it includes an exception for individuals appointed as ministers who can participate (without voting rights) before their election to Parliament.  This exception acknowledges the practicalities of government formation. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional provisions regarding the oaths and penalties for MPs.


**4. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following statements:**

1. The Citizenship Act, 1955, allows for dual citizenship, mirroring the practices of countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
2. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, introduced through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, is a special provision linked to the Assam Accord, a memorandum of settlement between the central government and leaders of the Assam Movement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship Act, 1955, does *not* provide for dual citizenship.  India, unlike the US or UK, generally adheres to the principle of single citizenship.  This is a fundamental aspect of Indian citizenship law.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 6A, added via the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, is directly related to the Assam Accord. This accord aimed to resolve the long-standing issue of illegal immigration in Assam.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the core features of the Citizenship Act, 1955, and its amendments.


**5. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during the Lok Sabha elections in Kerala.
2.  Violations of the MCC, lacking statutory backing, are unenforceable through legal prosecution. However, certain provisions can be enforced through corresponding provisions in statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during state assembly elections in Kerala, not the Lok Sabha elections.  The initial application was at the state level before wider adoption.

Statement 2 is correct. The MCC, while crucial for free and fair elections, lacks the force of law.  This means direct prosecution for violations is not possible.  However, certain actions that violate the MCC also contravene other existing laws, such as the Representation of the People Act, 1951, allowing for indirect enforcement.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the historical context and enforceability of the MCC.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and was enacted in October 2005.
2.  The Supreme Court, in the case of *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government*, established the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, it came into force in October 2005, but was *enacted* in June 2005.  The dates are interchanged in the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's judgment in *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* played a significant role in establishing the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression). This case laid the groundwork for the subsequent enactment of the RTI Act.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the chronology and legal basis of the RTI Act.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in states with tribal populations, but not in states without tribal populations.
2.  ADCs and ARCs possess extensive powers, including executive, legislative, and judicial powers, derived directly from the Constitution, unlike the Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) under the Fifth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's application is limited to specific states (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram) with significant tribal populations.  It doesn't apply universally to all states with tribal populations.  The statement misrepresents the geographic scope of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is correct.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule have substantial autonomy, encompassing executive, legislative, and judicial functions, unlike the more limited advisory role of TACs under the Fifth Schedule.  This reflects the unique constitutional arrangements for these areas. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the powers and applicability of the Sixth Schedule.


**8. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can form a new state by uniting two or more existing states or parts of states without requiring the prior recommendation of the President.
2.  A bill concerning the formation of a new state must be introduced in Parliament only after receiving the President's recommendation, and the President must consult with the concerned state legislatures before making the recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 3 explicitly requires the President's prior recommendation for any bill concerning the formation of new states or alteration of existing ones.  The statement incorrectly omits this crucial constitutional requirement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President's recommendation is mandatory before Parliament can introduce such a bill. Furthermore, the President is constitutionally obligated to consult with the affected state legislatures before making the recommendation. This process ensures that the states involved have a voice in the matter. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional process for state formation.


**9. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI), consider the following statements:**

1. The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners for a term of five years or until they reach the age of 62, whichever is earlier.
2. The Union Ministry of Home Affairs decides the election schedule for both general elections and by-elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President appoints the Chief Election Commissioner and Election Commissioners, but their tenure is six years, or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier. The statement incorrectly shortens the tenure and lowers the retirement age.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ECI itself, and not the Ministry of Home Affairs, is responsible for deciding the election schedule.  This independence is vital for ensuring free and fair elections.  The statement attributes this crucial power to the wrong authority.  All options except (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the ECI's composition and powers.


**10. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a constitutional body established under Article 324 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court has the power to directly appoint and remove the Director of the CBI.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is a statutory body, not a constitutional body.  It was created through legislation, not enshrined in the Constitution itself.  The statement incorrectly classifies the CBI's legal basis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court plays a role in overseeing the CBI, it does not have the power to directly appoint or remove the Director.  The appointment and removal process is governed by statutory provisions and involves other actors.  The statement incorrectly attributes this power to the Supreme Court.  All options except (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the CBI's legal status and governance structure.





**1. With reference to the Lok Sabha Secretariat and Rajya Sabha Secretariat, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both secretariats are governed by the same set of recruitment and conditions of service rules, promulgated by the President in consultation with the Speaker and Chairman respectively.
2.  The Secretary Generals of both houses hold ranks equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary and occupy the same position in the table of precedence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats have recruitment and conditions of service rules promulgated by the President,  they are separate sets of rules. The Lok Sabha's rules are made in consultation with the Speaker, while the Rajya Sabha's rules are made in consultation with the Chairman.  They are not identical.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the Secretary-Generals of both houses hold ranks equivalent to that of the Cabinet Secretary, their positions in the table of precedence differ. The Cabinet Secretary holds a higher position (11th) than the Secretary, Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha (23rd).


**2. With reference to the President's Address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 86 explicitly mandates the President to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of each session.
2.  The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, altered Article 87 to specify the occasions for the President's address to both Houses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 86 allows the President to address either House or both Houses together, but it does not mandate any specific frequency.  The mandatory addresses are governed by Article 87.

Statement 2 is correct. The original Article 87(1) required the President to address both Houses at the beginning of every session.  The First Amendment Act, 1951, modified this to specify the address at the beginning of the first session after each general election and the first session of each year.


**3. With reference to the Cabinet Secretary, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Secretary has direct administrative control over all working departments of the Union Government.
2. The Cabinet Secretary is the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board (CSB).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretary is considered *primus inter pares* (first among equals) among the secretaries of the Union Government.  They facilitate inter-ministerial coordination but do not have direct administrative control over individual working departments.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Cabinet Secretary is indeed the ex-officio Chairman of the Civil Services Board (CSB).


**4. With reference to Article 329(b) of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 329(b) allows for judicial review of election results at any stage, even after the Election Commission's official notification.
2.  Section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides an alternative mechanism to challenge the validity of an election, namely, through an election petition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 329(b) explicitly restricts challenges to elections to election petitions filed as prescribed by law.  It limits judicial intervention after the Election Commission's official notification. The Supreme Court's ruling in *N. P. Ponnuswami vs Returning Officer* reinforces this limitation.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 80 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951, provides the legal avenue to challenge election validity through the filing of an election petition in the relevant High Court.


**5.  With reference to the Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee were both established simultaneously in 1921 as part of the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms.
2. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) was established in 1976 under Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both committees are significant, the Public Accounts Committee was established in 1921, but the Estimates Committee was first constituted much later, in 1950.  They were not established simultaneously.

Statement 2 is correct. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) was indeed established in 1976 under Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963, ten years after the Act's commencement.


**6. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a set of legally binding statutes enforced by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure free and fair elections.
2. Violations of the MCC are directly prosecutable under the Indian Penal Code.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is a set of guidelines, not legally binding statutes.  It is based on consensus with political parties and derives its authority from the ECI's power under Article 324.  It's not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Because the MCC lacks statutory backing, its violations are not directly prosecutable under the Indian Penal Code. However, some provisions can be enforced through related statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (earlier known as the Indian Penal Code).


**7. With reference to Lok Sabha Elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of proportional representation, ensuring that the number of seats allocated to each party is directly proportional to its vote share.
2.  The normal term of the Lok Sabha is five years from the date of its first meeting after general elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Sabha elections use a system of territorial representation, not proportional representation. Each constituency elects a single representative.

Statement 2 is correct. The normal term of the Lok Sabha is indeed five years from the date of its first meeting after the general elections.  However, the President can dissolve it earlier.


**8. With reference to the provisions related to re-polling under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, consider the following statements:**

1. Re-polling is mandated only in cases of booth capturing.
2. Re-polling can be conducted due to the death of a candidate from a recognized political party.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Re-polling is not *only* mandated in cases of booth capturing; it can also be ordered due to natural calamities, violence, damage to voting machines, etc.

Statement 2 is correct. The death of a candidate from a recognized political party is a valid reason for countermanding the election and ordering a re-poll.


**9. With reference to the "Silence Period" observed before voting in elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Silence Period" is a period during which political campaigning is completely prohibited across the entire nation.
2. The duration of the "Silence Period" is determined by the Election Commission of India (ECI) and can vary from election to election.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The silence period applies only to the specific areas where elections are being held, not the entire nation.

Statement 2 is correct. The ECI determines the duration of the silence period, which is typically a few days immediately preceding the election.  It is not fixed across all elections.


**10. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the President to create Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
2. ADCs and ARCs have the power to make laws on subjects including forest management, agriculture, and social customs, but not on matters related to land revenue and taxation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule empowers the *Governor*, not the President, to create ADCs and ARCs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs do possess the power to make laws on the mentioned subjects, and *also* have the power to collect land revenue, impose taxes, and regulate trading – powers significantly impacting their administrative autonomy.


**11. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The formation of a new state requires a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in either House of Parliament only on the recommendation of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The formation of a new state requires a law passed by Parliament, but this law needs  more than a simple majority. The exact majority requirements aren't specified in the Constitution, but it's generally understood that a substantial majority is required.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament on the recommendation of the President.  This safeguards the executive's role in such crucial constitutional matters.


**12. With reference to the differences between the Fifth and Sixth Schedules of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Fifth Schedule applies only to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, while the Sixth Schedule applies to certain scheduled areas declared by the President in any state of India.
2. The Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) under the Fifth Schedule have more extensive powers compared to the ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Fifth Schedule applies to scheduled areas declared by the President in any state of India, while the Sixth Schedule is specific to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The applicability is reversed in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule have far more extensive powers (executive, legislative, and judicial) than the TACs under the Fifth Schedule, which are primarily advisory bodies with limited executive powers.


**13. With reference to the Oath of Members of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 99 mandates that all Members of Parliament (MPs) must take their oath of office before the President only.
2.  A person who is appointed a Minister without being elected to Parliament can participate in the proceedings of the House and exercise the right to vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Article 99 states that the oath is to be subscribed before the President or a person appointed by him, it does not exclude other possibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A person appointed a Minister without being elected to Parliament can participate in proceedings, but they cannot vote until they take the oath of office after being elected.


**14. With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following statements:**

1. The Citizenship Act, 1955, explicitly provides for dual citizenship.
2. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, was added through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship Act, 1955, does *not* provide for dual citizenship.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Section 6A was added through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, not 2019, and it's linked to the Assam Accord.


**15. With reference to Emergency Provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  A financial emergency under Article 360 has been declared multiple times in India's history.
2.  The 44th Amendment Act, 1978, mandated that the President can revoke a proclamation of emergency only with the approval of both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A financial emergency under Article 360 has never been declared in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 44th Amendment Act did not require parliamentary approval for the revocation of a proclamation of emergency. The President can revoke it at any time.


**1. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area, while Sikkim is partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area.
2.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, entry into Protected or Restricted Areas by foreigners requires a special permit, except for Bhutanese citizens.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that Arunachal Pradesh is entirely within Protected Areas, while Sikkim has a dual designation, encompassing both Protected and Restricted Areas.  This accurately reflects the geographical distribution of these designations.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, clearly mandates that foreign nationals (excluding Bhutanese citizens) need special permits to access Protected or Restricted Areas. This is a crucial aspect of the regulatory framework governing access to these sensitive areas.  The exception for Bhutanese citizens highlights a specific policy consideration within the broader regulatory framework. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they fail to acknowledge the accuracy of both statements.


**2. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the tax-sharing arrangements between the Union and State governments, primarily based on Article 246.
2.  The Finance Commission's recommendations determine the vertical devolution of resources (the share of states from the divisible pool) and horizontal devolution (distribution among states), but grants-in-aid are determined solely by the Union Government's discretion.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Seventh Schedule, guided by Article 246, forms the constitutional bedrock of India's fiscal federalism, defining the tax powers and responsibilities of the Union and State governments. This is a fundamental principle of India's federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending both vertical and horizontal devolution of resources, grants-in-aid are also constitutionally mandated under Article 275, though the quantum is influenced by the Finance Commission's recommendations.  The Union Government doesn't have absolute discretion in this matter. Therefore, the statement misrepresents the constitutional role and influence of the Finance Commission on grants-in-aid.  Only option (a) correctly identifies the accuracy of statement 1.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their local self-government falls under the purview of the Union Government, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.
2.  The first Cantonment in India, Barrackpore (Calcutta), was established in 1765 by the British East India Company, and currently, there are 61 cantonments, with six established post-independence.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Cantonment Boards are governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their administration falls under the Union List, reflecting the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act's provisions. This highlights the central government's control over cantonment administration.

Statement 2 is also correct. The provided information accurately mentions the establishment of Barrackpore as the first cantonment in 1765 by the East India Company, and the current total number of cantonments (61), with six added after India's independence.  This demonstrates a clear understanding of the historical development and current status of cantonments.  The combination of accurate historical and contemporary information makes (c) the only viable option.


**4. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from adverse climate change effects to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution.
2.  This judgment, arising from a writ petition concerning the Great Indian Bustard, exemplifies the judiciary's role in expanding the scope of fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14, 21, and 19.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Supreme Court's decision to connect the right to a healthy environment, free from the negative impacts of climate change, with the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 21. This establishes a significant legal precedent.

Statement 2 is also correct. The case concerning the Great Indian Bustard's protection serves as a prime example of the judiciary's power to broaden the interpretation and application of fundamental rights, notably Articles 14, 21, and 19, demonstrating judicial activism in environmental protection. The linkage of the case to the expansion of fundamental rights makes (c) the appropriate answer.


**5. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019 and related rules, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CAA 2019 grants citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians and who entered India before December 31, 2014, excluding those from certain tribal areas in the Northeast and areas under the Inner Line Permit system.
2. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, allow applicants for citizenship by naturalization to provide a wider range of documents as proof of entry into India, including visas, residential permits, census slips, and Aadhaar cards, and require a declaration renouncing the citizenship of another country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the key provisions of the CAA 2019, specifying the religious groups, entry deadline, and exclusion zones.  This highlights the Act's specific criteria for granting citizenship to certain categories of migrants.

Statement 2 correctly outlines the amendments introduced by the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, concerning acceptable proof of entry and the mandatory renunciation of previous citizenship.  This reflects the procedural changes to the citizenship application process.  Both statements are factually accurate and therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of External Affairs has clarified that the existing OCI rules remain unchanged, dispelling concerns about OCI cardholders being reclassified as foreigners.
2. The CAA 2019 provides that the central government may cancel OCI registration on five grounds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Ministry of External Affairs' statement reassuring OCI cardholders about the continuity of existing rules and dispelling fears of reclassification. This addresses a crucial concern related to the status of OCI cardholders.

Statement 2 correctly points out that the CAA 2019 grants the central government the power to revoke OCI registration under specific conditions, demonstrating the government's authority over the OCI scheme.  Both statements are factual and therefore option (c) is correct.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, stemming from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specified states, granting them legislative, executive, and judicial powers over matters such as forest management, agriculture, and social customs.
2.  The Sixth Schedule applies to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, while the Fifth Schedule applies to certain Scheduled Areas declared by the President in various states, with the latter primarily concerning the administration of Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) with limited executive powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the powers vested in the Governor under the Sixth Schedule to create ADCs and ARCs and the extensive authority granted to these councils.  This highlights a key aspect of the Sixth Schedule's provisions for autonomous governance in tribal areas.

Statement 2 accurately contrasts the Sixth Schedule's application to the four Northeastern states with the Fifth Schedule's broader application and the difference in the powers of the administrative bodies. This comparison clarifies the distinct roles and scopes of the two schedules.  Therefore, option (c) is correct as both statements are accurate.


**8. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution empowers Parliament to create new states by redrawing boundaries, uniting territories, or merging parts of existing states, but such a bill requires the President's recommendation for introduction in either House of Parliament.
2. The formation of Telangana state on June 2, 2014, exemplifies the process outlined in Article 3, with the Parliament enacting a law based on the President's recommendation, thereby altering the boundaries of Andhra Pradesh.

The mention of a specific event adds a practical dimension to the legal framework.  Both statements are factually correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.


**9. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS, initially introduced in 1969 based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations, provided special financial assistance to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, but the 14th Finance Commission discontinued the SCS system.
2.  While the Constitution doesn't explicitly mention SCS, states facing similar challenges now receive special financial support through various provisions under Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J, and through need-based special packages.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

2. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), established under the Companies Act, 1956, by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme, with a vision to create a reliable and widespread IT-enabled network of citizen service points.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the role and purpose of CSCs within the NeGP framework, emphasizing their significance in rural areas and their objective of improving service delivery. This highlights a key aspect of the CSC scheme's goals.

Statement 2 accurately explains the role of the CSC SPV, its establishment, and its vision, showing the organizational structure and aims behind the implementation of the CSC scheme. This provides important contextual information about the governance of the CSC initiative.  Both statements are factually correct, leading to option (c) as the correct answer.


**1. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area, while Sikkim is partially a Protected Area and partially a Restricted Area.
2.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, designates the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands and a portion of Sikkim as Restricted Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that Arunachal Pradesh is entirely within Protected Areas, and Sikkim has a dual designation, part Protected and part Restricted.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, explicitly mentions the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands and a part of Sikkim as falling under Restricted Area classifications.  This is a crucial aspect of India's border control and security regulations, particularly concerning foreign access to sensitive regions.

Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the information provided regarding the geographical designations of Protected and Restricted Areas in India. Option (d) is incorrect for the same reason.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of India's administrative divisions and regulations concerning foreign access to specific territories.


**2. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible tax revenue for states, based on criteria including income distance, area, and population.
2.  Article 293 of the Constitution allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the Union Government's consent if already indebted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the 15th Finance Commission's recommendation allocated 41% of the divisible pool to states, using multiple criteria for distribution among them.  This highlights the complex dynamics of resource allocation within India's federal structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293, as stated in the text, permits state governments to borrow only within India, not internationally.  Furthermore, the condition of requiring Union consent for further borrowing applies only if a state is already indebted to the central government.  This distinction is critical for understanding the limitations on state financial autonomy.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the information about the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations.  The question assesses factual knowledge of constitutional provisions and the financial mechanisms governing Centre-State relations in India.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, and their local self-government falls under the Union List.
2.  The first Cantonment in India, Barrackpore (Calcutta), was established in 1757, immediately following the Battle of Plassey.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly indicates that Cantonment Boards are governed by the Cantonments Act, 2006, and fall under the Union List, reflecting their unique administrative position within India's federal system.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act's relevance is also correctly stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions that Cantonments originated after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, it states that Barrackpore (Calcutta) was the first Cantonment, established in 1765, not 1757. This subtle difference in dates makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately represents the information provided about the administration and legal framework governing Cantonment Boards in India. The question tests the ability to critically analyze information and identify subtle factual discrepancies.


**4. With reference to the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's judgment, in the case of ‘M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others’, explicitly recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
2.  The aforementioned judgment primarily focused on the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, thereby illustrating the Court's power to expand the scope of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Supreme Court recognized the right to be free from adverse climate change effects under Articles 14 (equality) and 21 (right to life). This ruling has significant implications for environmental jurisprudence in India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The text clearly links the judgment to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, showcasing how the Court used this case to expand the interpretation of fundamental rights, notably Articles 14, 21, and 19 (freedom of speech, etc.), to encompass broader environmental protection.  This demonstrates the judiciary's role in shaping environmental policy.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the content of the provided text regarding the Supreme Court's judgment and its implications. The question evaluates understanding of judicial activism, constitutional interpretation, and environmental law in India.


**5.  With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCS designation was initially introduced in 1969 based on recommendations from the Fifth Finance Commission, with Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland among the first recipients.
2.  The primary rationale behind granting SCS is to provide financial assistance to states facing significant geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, thereby promoting balanced regional development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text directly states that SCS was introduced in 1969 based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations, and it names Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland as initial recipients. This demonstrates the historical context of this policy.

Statement 2 is also correct. The text explains that SCS aims to assist states with geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, aligning with the goal of balanced regional development. This shows the policy's underlying developmental objectives.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect the information provided regarding the origins and rationale behind the Special Category Status in India. The question tests knowledge of India's developmental policies and Centre-State relations.


**6. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are exempted from operating in Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas function as mobile courts, possessing both civil and criminal jurisdiction to resolve petty disputes at the village level, while adhering strictly to the rules of evidence outlined in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that Gram Nyayalayas are established under the 2008 Act and specifies the exemptions for certain states and tribal areas. This showcases the Act's limitations in its geographical reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions Gram Nyayalayas as mobile courts with civil and criminal jurisdiction, it explicitly states they are *not* bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but operate according to principles of natural justice.  This highlights a key difference between Gram Nyayalayas and traditional courts.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the information on the establishment and jurisdictional scope of Gram Nyayalayas. The question assesses detailed knowledge of India's alternative dispute resolution mechanisms and their legal framework.


**7. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively, and is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience to court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of any court or interfere with the administration of justice, but not the publication of materials that prejudice judicial proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly identifies Articles 129 and 215 as the constitutional basis for the Supreme Court and High Courts' power to punish for contempt, and it correctly cites the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, as the defining legislation.  This demonstrates an understanding of the legal framework surrounding contempt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the description of civil contempt is accurate, the description of criminal contempt is incomplete. The text explicitly states that criminal contempt includes the publication of matters that prejudice or interfere with judicial proceedings.  This omission makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the information on the constitutional and legal basis of contempt of court in India.  The question assesses precise knowledge of legal definitions and constitutional provisions.


**8. With reference to the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Committee comprises 30 members, with 20 elected from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha, utilizing a system of proportional representation through a single transferable vote.
2.  The Committee's primary function is to review the progress of Hindi's use in the official affairs of the Union and submit recommendations to the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the composition of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language, including the number of members and the electoral system used. This demonstrates an understanding of parliamentary procedures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Committee submits its recommendations to the *President*, not the Prime Minister.  This seemingly minor detail makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 1 accurately reflects the information provided about the composition and functions of the Parliamentary Committee on Official Language. This question assesses attention to detail and knowledge of parliamentary committees.


**9. With reference to the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman, with the Chairman of the Committee appointed by the Rajya Sabha Deputy Chairman from amongst its members.
2. The Committee's primary responsibility is to investigate and address breaches of parliamentary privileges, which are special rights and immunities granted to both Houses of Parliament and their members to ensure efficient functioning.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges has 10 members, not 15, nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.  It also states that the Chairman of the Committee is appointed by the *Rajya Sabha Chairman*, not the Deputy Chairman.  These inaccuracies render the statement false.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Committee's responsibility for investigating breaches of parliamentary privileges and their importance for the smooth functioning of Parliament.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because only statement 2 accurately reflects the information on the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges. The question tests precise knowledge of parliamentary committees and their functions.


**10. With reference to Cabinet Committees of the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. Cabinet Committees are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution and are established according to the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.
2.  The Political Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee are chaired by the Home Minister, while the Parliamentary Affairs Committee is chaired by the Prime Minister.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Cabinet Committees are *extra-constitutional*, meaning they are not mentioned in the Constitution, despite being established under the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961. This highlights the distinction between constitutional and extra-constitutional bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text specifies that the Political Affairs Committee and the Economic Affairs Committee are chaired by the *Prime Minister*, not the Home Minister.  It also correctly states that the Parliamentary Affairs Committee is chaired by the Home Minister.  This reversal of chairmanships makes the statement false.


Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because both statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the constitutional status and chairmanship of Cabinet Committees. The question tests knowledge of the Union Government's organizational structure and decision-making processes.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to solely enhance the participation of elected representatives in Panchayat Development Plan (PDP) preparation.
2.  The campaign's thematic approach is based on a localized interpretation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" strategy, and utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as People’s Plan Campaign or PPC) does aim to accelerate people’s participation in PDP preparation, it's not limited to elected representatives.  It actively involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders at all three tiers of Panchayats. The focus is on broader, inclusive participation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly employs a thematic approach rooted in the localization of SDGs.  This "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" approach utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) – a multi-domain, multi-sectoral index – to assess the overall development and identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat level, which are then presented in Gram Sabhas.  This process forms a crucial part of the PDP preparation.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such centre globally, aiming to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the auditing of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) primarily through the AuditOnline application.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is the first such centre in *India*, not globally.  While it aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies,  the claim of being the first globally is inaccurate.  Many countries have established similar institutions or mechanisms for auditing local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CAG does oversee the audit of PRIs and ULBs, it primarily does so through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states, who work under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision.  The AuditOnline application, while a significant tool for online auditing of panchayat accounts, is not the *primary* mechanism through which the CAG exercises its control and supervision.  The CAG's mandate flows from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, which predates AuditOnline.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented through state governments in sectors falling under the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current funding pattern for core CSSs in eight North Eastern States and three Himalayan States is a 90:10 ratio (Centre:State), while it's 60:40 for other states, reflecting the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The central government provides a significant portion of the funding, but states also contribute.  Furthermore, CSSs are implemented through state governments in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, not solely the Union List.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 90:10 and 60:40 funding ratios for core CSSs are accurate (for the specified states), the statement incorrectly attributes this to the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.  The 14th Finance Commission did abolish the Plan-Non Plan distinction, impacting the overall funding mechanism, but the specific funding pattern for CSSs (the differentiated ratios for different states) is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the 14th Finance Commission.


**4. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and its constitutionality, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional, citing violations of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
2.  The Aadhaar Act mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile and internet connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* *did not* declare the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.  Instead, it upheld the constitutionality of the Act,  while also placing crucial limitations on its application and data usage.  The court affirmed that the Act did *not* violate fundamental rights under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 in their entirety, but imposed conditions to protect privacy rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's judgment clarified that while Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be *forced* on people for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  The court recognized the importance of Aadhaar for targeted delivery of benefits but also upheld the right to privacy, limiting the mandatory nature of Aadhaar to specific contexts.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The grant of SCS is based on objective criteria enshrined in the Constitution, ensuring transparency and equity in resource allocation among states.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state currently holds this status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The grant of SCS is not based on objective, constitutionally enshrined criteria.  It's a discretionary classification given by the central government to assist states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. The criteria for granting SCS are not explicitly defined in the Constitution and have evolved over time based on various factors considered by the Finance Commissions.  This lack of clear, objective criteria has led to demands for its abolition and replacement with more transparent mechanisms for providing special assistance to deserving states.

Statement 2 is correct.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS classification was effectively abolished. While some states may continue to receive special funding for various reasons (often linked to geographical or socio-economic challenges), this funding is not based on the SCS designation.  The current special funding pattern is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers and other factors, not the now-defunct SCS status.


**6. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule grants special autonomous status to certain tribal areas within the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram only.
2. The demand for including Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule is based on the region's unique geographical features and the need for protecting its distinct cultural identity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), grants special autonomous status to certain tribal areas within the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The statement is partially correct in that it names four states, but omits that the Sixth Schedule also applies to some areas of other states. The specific areas are defined within the schedule itself, and are not merely limited to the entirety of the four named states.

Statement 2 is correct.  The demand for including Ladakh in the Sixth Schedule arises from the region's unique geographical location, its distinct socio-cultural identity, and the need for safeguarding the interests of its tribal populations.  Advocates argue that the special provisions of the Sixth Schedule would provide Ladakh with greater autonomy and protection of its unique character.  However, the applicability and appropriateness of the Sixth Schedule for Ladakh are subjects of ongoing debate and discussion.


**7. With reference to the Sevottam model, consider the following statements:**

1. Sevottam is a model primarily focused on improving the grievance redressal mechanism within government organizations, leaving other aspects of service delivery untouched.
2. The Sevottam model, comprising three modules (Citizen's Charter, Grievance Redressal Mechanism, and Capability Building for Service Delivery), aims to enhance the overall quality of public service delivery.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sevottam model does include a module on Grievance Redressal Mechanism, it's not solely focused on that aspect.  The model is a comprehensive approach to improving the overall quality of public service delivery. It recognizes that effective grievance redressal is only one component of a broader effort to enhance citizen satisfaction and service efficiency.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sevottam model is explicitly designed to improve the quality of public service delivery through a three-pronged approach.  The three modules – Citizen's Charter (defining service standards), Grievance Redressal Mechanism (providing avenues for feedback and redressal), and Capability Building for Service Delivery (enhancing the skills and knowledge of public servants) – work together to create a more citizen-centric and efficient public service system.  The model integrates these elements to create a holistic improvement in service delivery.


**8. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for administering military installations, with limited involvement in providing civic amenities to the civilian population.
2.  The administration of cantonments falls under the purview of the Union Government, and Cantonment Boards operate under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards are responsible for providing civic amenities to both the military and civilian populations residing within the cantonment area.  While cantonments originated as areas for military troops, they now have a significant civilian population, and the Cantonment Boards provide essential services such as public health, water supply, primary education, and other civic functions.  Their role extends beyond purely military administration.

Statement 2 is correct.  The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List).  Cantonment Boards are established and operate under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is enacted in accordance with the principles of local self-government as enshrined in the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.  The Act outlines the powers and responsibilities of the Cantonment Boards in managing the cantonments.  The Union Ministry of Defence exercises administrative control over these boards.


**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states, allocating weights to criteria including income distance, area, and population (2011 census).
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the Union government's consent if the state is already indebted to the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states,  distributing it based on various criteria including income distance, area, population (2011 census), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  This reflects the Commission's attempt to balance the needs of different states within the federal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can borrow within India, but if a state is already indebted to the Union government, further borrowing requires prior Union consent. This restriction is a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism, ensuring the Union's control over overall fiscal stability.  The statement incorrectly claims states can borrow both domestically and internationally.


**2. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly defined under Article 370.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the practice of granting Special Category Status has been entirely discontinued, replaced by a new funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain a specific provision for granting Special Category Status (SCS). While several articles (371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J) provide special provisions for certain states,  there's no single article dedicated to defining SCS.  The practice evolved over time, primarily based on Finance Commission recommendations.  The mention of Article 370 is a deliberate distractor, as it deals with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed).

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively led to the discontinuation of the SCS designation.  The rationale was to move towards a more transparent and equitable system of funding, although specific funding patterns for Northeastern and Himalayan states continue based on other considerations such as geographical and socio-economic challenges. This shift signifies a change in the approach to addressing regional disparities.


**3. With reference to the powers of the Union Government regarding borrowing, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union government can borrow money only within the country, as per Article 292.
2.  Under Article 292, the Union government is empowered to borrow both within and outside India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 292 grants the Union government the power to borrow money both within and outside India. This power is crucial for managing the national economy and undertaking large-scale development projects.  The statement incorrectly restricts this power to domestic borrowing.

Statement 2 is correct and accurately reflects the constitutional provision granted to the Union government under Article 292. This power allows the government to access a wider range of funding sources to meet its financial obligations and development goals.


**4. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are primarily designed to provide services to urban citizens in an integrated manner.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are primarily focused on delivering services to *rural* citizens, bridging the digital divide and improving access to government and private services in rural areas. The scheme aims to reach the most remote and underserved populations.  The statement incorrectly attributes the focus to urban areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSC SPV was set up under the *Companies Act, 1956*, not the Information Technology Act, 2000.  While the CSC scheme is deeply related to IT and e-governance, the legal framework for the SPV is derived from company law.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The NHRC's accreditation by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has been consistently maintained at the highest 'A' status since its inception.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional, body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not through a constitutional provision.  The statement incorrectly claims it's a constitutional body.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NHRC's GANHRI accreditation has faced challenges and has not consistently held the highest 'A' status since its inception.  Recent years have seen deferrals in accreditation due to concerns raised by GANHRI.  The statement misrepresents the reality of the NHRC's accreditation status.


**6. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in the states of Meghalaya, Assam, and Tripura only.
2.  The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule does establish autonomous district councils, it also applies to the state of Mizoram, in addition to Meghalaya, Assam, and Tripura. The statement inaccurately limits the application of the Sixth Schedule to only three states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, found under Article 244(2), was indeed included in the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. This committee's work was crucial in shaping the provisions for the administration of tribal areas in the Northeastern states.


**7. Consider the following statements on the powers of the Director-General of Posts (DGPS):**

1.  The DGPS has the power to make regulations on matters such as the charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps, but not on matters related to the interception of postal articles.
2.  The Indian Post Office is not liable for any loss or damage to postal articles, regardless of the circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DGPS *does* have the power to make regulations on charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps,  *and* also has powers related to the interception of postal articles under specific conditions outlined in law. The statement incorrectly limits the DGPS's regulatory powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Post Office is *not* exempt from liability for all losses or damages. While there are limitations on liability, as prescribed by law, the Post Office does incur liability under specific circumstances, such as those related to the provision of services. The statement incorrectly claims complete exemption from liability.


**8. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on capacity building for officers of the All India Services.
2. A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is much broader than just All India Services officers. It encompasses *all* civil servants (including contractual employees) across various ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies of the Union Government. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the mission.

Statement 2 is correct. A major objective of Mission Karmayogi is to transition from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building. This emphasizes competency-based development, aligning skillsets with the actual roles and responsibilities of civil servants.


**9. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a report submitted by a sub-group of Chief Ministers in 2010.
2.  All transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current framework for CSSs is based on a report from 2015, not 2010, submitted by a sub-group of Chief Ministers on rationalization of CSSs. The statement presents an inaccurate year.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  All transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India. This reflects the federal structure, with funds reaching states through their own financial systems. The statement incorrectly specifies the Consolidated Fund of India.


**10. With reference to the AuditOnline application, consider the following statements:**

1.  AuditOnline is an application developed by the Ministry of Rural Development to conduct online audits of panchayat accounts.
2.  AuditOnline was awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Geneva.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AuditOnline was developed by the Ministry of *Panchayati Raj*, not the Ministry of Rural Development, to conduct online audits of panchayat accounts. The statement incorrectly identifies the developing ministry.

Statement 2 is correct. AuditOnline did receive the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 at the ITU, Geneva. This award recognizes its contribution to improving the efficiency and transparency of local government audits.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (fragments of text), some questions might be more challenging to create than others to meet the difficulty and factual recall requirements.


**1. With reference to the Election Commission of India (ECI) and the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC was first introduced in the 1960s during state assembly elections in Kerala, laying down guidelines for political parties and candidates to ensure free and fair elections.
2.  Following recent violations of the MCC during Lok Sabha elections, the ECI issued directives mandating the ethical use of social media platforms by political parties and their representatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect information presented in the source text. Statement 1 correctly identifies the origin and purpose of the MCC, highlighting its role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.  Statement 2 accurately describes the ECI's recent response to MCC violations, demonstrating its proactive role in regulating political conduct in the digital age.  There's no contradictory information or misleading details presented.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the distribution of resources between the Union and States in India:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, with a current vertical devolution to states standing at 51% based on the 15th Finance Commission recommendations.
2.  Horizontal devolution among states considers factors like income distance, area, population (2011 census), and demographic performance, with weights assigned by the 15th Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission does recommend the distribution of Union-levied taxes, the source material states the vertical devolution to states is 41%, not 51%.  This is a crucial factual discrepancy making the statement incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. The source explicitly details the factors and weights considered in horizontal devolution as per the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations.


**3. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) and special financial packages in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS, outlining specific provisions for their development based on geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
2.  Special financial packages, different from SCS, are discretionary grants provided to states facing challenges, offering additional financial assistance beyond the usual allocation mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that the Constitution does *not* include any provision for categorizing states as SCS.  While special provisions exist under Articles 371, etc., these are not the same as the SCS designation. Statement 2 is correct. The passage defines special financial packages as discretionary grants, distinct from the now-defunct SCS, offered to address specific state-level needs and challenges.


**4. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and its constitutional implications, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment deemed the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional, citing violations of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21.
2.  The Act mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes but does not enforce its use for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment *affirmed* the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, not deemed it unconstitutional.  The court did, however, place limitations on its use and data handling. Statement 2 is correct.  The source text explicitly states that while Aadhaar is mandatory for social welfare schemes, it cannot be forced for banking or telecom services.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes funded entirely by the central government and implemented through state governments in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework of CSSs, based on a 2015 report, focuses on schemes comprising the National Development Agenda, with funding patterns varying depending on the state's location and status.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the Centre.  They are implemented through states, but the sectors involved fall under both State and Concurrent lists. Statement 2 is correct and aligns with the information in the source; it accurately describes the funding structure and the rationale behind the CSS framework.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system:**

1. The ILP system, originating from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873, is primarily used to regulate movement near India's international borders and protect tribal cultures in Northeast India.
2.  NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI card holders are eligible for ILPs, needing only to apply for a regular Protected/Restricted Area Permit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The ILP system's origins and its dual purposes (border regulation and tribal protection) are accurately represented. Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders are *not* eligible for ILPs and must apply for different permits.


**7. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC, a constitutional body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, has consistently maintained its ‘A’ status accreditation from the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI).
2.  The NHRC's headquarters is located in Mumbai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that the NHRC's GANHRI accreditation has been deferred, not consistently maintained at 'A' status. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The source specifies that the NHRC's headquarters is in New Delhi, not Mumbai.


**8.  With reference to the Indian Passport system, consider the following statements:**

1. The Director-General of Passports (DGPS) has the power to issue passports to individuals who are not citizens of India if deemed necessary in the public interest.
2.  The Indian passport system offers only two classes of passports: Ordinary (blue) and Official (maroon).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The source text explicitly states that the DGPS may issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The source mentions three classes of passports: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon).


**9. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs, one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), primarily focus on providing services to urban citizens through a decentralized network.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), established under the Companies Act, 1956, aims to develop CSCs as a reliable and ubiquitous IT-enabled network of citizen service points across India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are designed to serve rural citizens, not primarily urban ones, and employ a centralized, not decentralized network. Statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided in the source material regarding the CSC SPV's establishment, purpose, and vision.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, stemming from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, mandates the establishment of autonomous district councils in all states of Northeast India.
2.  There's a current demand to include Ladakh under the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule does establish autonomous district councils, it's not mandatory for all Northeast Indian states. It applies to specific areas within those states. Statement 2 is correct, aligning with the information provided about the demand for Ladakh's inclusion in the Sixth Schedule.  The statement does not go into the merits or demerits of the proposal, only stating the existing demand.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offenses against laws relating to matters where the Union's executive power extends.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial or for offences against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in various situations, including those involving death sentences.  It's not limited solely to offenses under Union executive power.  The scope includes sentences by court-martial and those for offences against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 encompasses a broader range of situations than just those governed by Union executive power. It specifically covers sentences awarded by court-martial and those given for offences under laws related to matters within the Union's executive jurisdiction.  This reflects the President's role as the supreme head of the executive branch and the armed forces.  The power extends to death sentences, reinforcing its significance in capital punishment cases.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the last available legal remedy in India, applicable only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  A curative petition can be filed only if the petitioner can demonstrate that the Supreme Court judgment violated principles of natural justice or that there was a demonstrable apprehension of bias by a judge.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the final recourse available after the Supreme Court rejects a review petition (under Article 137). It's a mechanism designed to address extraordinary situations where fundamental errors may have occurred in the judicial process.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The grounds for filing a curative petition are extremely stringent.  The petitioner must convincingly establish a violation of principles of natural justice, demonstrating that the proceedings were fundamentally flawed.  Additionally, a demonstrable apprehension of bias on the part of a judge, significantly impacting the judgment, is a valid ground.  The bar is deliberately high to prevent frivolous filings.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established under a state-sponsored scheme to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The FTSCs are funded entirely by the states, with no central government contribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FTSCs are part of a centrally sponsored scheme, aimed at significantly reducing the backlog of cases, particularly those involving rape and POCSO Act violations.  The scheme aims to ensure swifter justice for victims.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  FTSCs are funded from the Nirbhaya Fund, which is a centrally managed fund established by the Government of India.  The central government bears the expenditure, making it a centrally sponsored scheme, not solely state-funded.  This reflects the national commitment to addressing these crimes efficiently.


**4. With reference to Zero FIRs, consider the following statements:**

1. A Zero FIR can only be registered if the crime occurred within the jurisdiction of the police station where it is initially filed.
2. The concept of Zero FIR is a recent innovation, introduced only after the 2012 Nirbhaya case.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The defining characteristic of a Zero FIR is that it can be registered regardless of the location where the crime occurred.  The purpose is to ensure that victims can report crimes immediately without being turned away due to jurisdictional issues.  The FIR is later transferred to the appropriate police station for investigation.

Statement 2 is incorrect while the concept gained prominence after the Nirbhaya case and the subsequent Justice Verma Committee recommendations, the underlying principle of allowing immediate registration of complaints irrespective of jurisdiction has existed in various forms for some time. The Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 codified the concept, but it wasn't a wholly new idea.


**5. With reference to the Doctrine of Coverture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Coverture is a concept originating in English common law that grants married women complete legal independence from their husbands.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018) directly challenged and overturned the Doctrine of Coverture in Indian law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Doctrine of Coverture, stemming from English common law, actually *subordinated* married women's legal existence to that of their husbands.  It treated the husband and wife as a single legal entity, effectively stripping the woman of her independent legal rights and property ownership.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While *Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018)* addressed the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) and highlighted the historical roots of MRE in the Doctrine of Coverture, the Supreme Court did not directly overturn the Doctrine of Coverture itself as a legal concept in Indian law. The case focused on the unconstitutionality of the MRE, not the broader doctrine.  The Doctrine of Coverture is not directly applicable in India, but its legacy influenced aspects of Indian law until the case.


**6. With reference to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction mandates that conflicting provisions of law must be interpreted in a way that renders one provision entirely redundant.
2. The Supreme Court uses the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to resolve contradictions between different sections of a statute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction aims to reconcile conflicting provisions of law, not to eliminate one entirely. The goal is to give effect to every part of the statute as far as possible.  It seeks to find a harmonious interpretation that avoids rendering any part meaningless or ineffective.

Statement 2 is correct. When different sections of a statute appear contradictory, the Supreme Court employs the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction to interpret them in a way that resolves the conflict.  This approach prioritizes giving meaning to all parts of the law, ensuring internal consistency and avoiding a situation where one section nullifies another.


**7. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments are administered exclusively by the state governments, with no involvement of the central government.
2. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments in India, and it aligns with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While cantonments have a local self-government aspect, their administration falls under the Union List (Entry 3), placing them under the central government's administrative control.  The Ministry of Defence plays a significant role in their oversight.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments.  It harmonizes the functioning of cantonment boards with the principles of local self-governance enshrined in the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with municipalities.


**8. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to a healthy environment is not explicitly guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* broadened the scope of fundamental rights to include protection from the adverse effects of climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in various judgments, has progressively recognized the right to a healthy environment as integral to the right to life (Article 21) and the right to equality (Article 14).  While not explicitly stated, the courts have interpreted these articles broadly to include environmental protection.

Statement 2 is correct.  The *M.K. Ranjitsinh* case is a landmark judgment where the Supreme Court explicitly linked the right to life and equality with the need for protection from climate change's adverse impacts.  This significantly expanded the scope of these fundamental rights, demonstrating the judiciary's proactive role in environmental protection.


**9. With reference to internet shutdowns, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017, allow for indefinite suspension of internet services in a region.
2. The Supreme Court, in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India*, ruled that internet shutdowns are permissible only for a temporary duration and must adhere to Article 19(2) restrictions on freedom of speech.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017, do *not* permit indefinite suspensions.  They allow for temporary suspensions, subject to specific conditions and for a limited duration (up to 15 days at a time).  Prolonged shutdowns are explicitly disallowed under the rules.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's ruling in *Anuradha Bhasin* established that internet shutdowns must be temporary and justified, needing to comply with Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which permits reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression.  The court emphasized the importance of upholding fundamental rights even during emergencies.


**10. With reference to the Telecom Act 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Telecom Act 2023 introduces a new framework for spectrum allocation, primarily based on auctions, but also includes provisions for administrative allocation in specified cases.
2. The Act explicitly brings Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms under its regulatory purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Telecom Act 2023 significantly changes the spectrum allocation process, shifting towards a more market-based approach through auctions. However, it retains the possibility of administrative allocation for specific purposes like national security, disaster management, and satellite services, reflecting the need for government control in crucial sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Telecom Act 2023 does *not* regulate OTT platforms.  This is a notable omission, leaving the regulation of these platforms to other existing laws or future legislation.  The Act primarily focuses on traditional telecommunications services and infrastructure.


**11. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) as the primary regulatory body, with the power to impose penalties for data breaches and hear grievances.
2. The Act mandates that all data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor, irrespective of the volume or sensitivity of data processed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI with significant powers, including imposing penalties for violations, investigating data breaches, and providing grievance redressal mechanisms.  This creates a robust framework for data protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act requires certain significant data fiduciaries (SDFs) – those handling large volumes or sensitive data – to appoint data protection officers and independent data auditors, it does not impose this requirement on all data fiduciaries.  The level of obligation is determined by the nature and volume of data handled.


**12. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar primarily serves as a proof of citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act declared Aadhaar mandatory for accessing all government services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is primarily a proof of identity and address for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal processes.  Aadhaar provides a unique identification number for various purposes, but it doesn't define citizenship status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2018 Supreme Court judgment upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but did *not* declare Aadhaar mandatory for all government services.  While it allowed for its use in social welfare schemes, it emphasized that it could not be compulsorily linked to services like bank accounts or mobile connections.  The ruling balanced the benefits of Aadhaar with the protection of individual rights.


**13. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes entirely funded by the central government and implemented by state governments.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on recommendations from a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers formed in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The sharing of funds is determined based on the nature of the scheme and the relative capabilities of the participating states.  This collaborative funding model is a cornerstone of the federal structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework governing CSSs is, to a large extent, shaped by the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers that was set up in 2015 to rationalize these schemes.  This reflects ongoing efforts to streamline the implementation and funding of such schemes.


**14. With reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, applies exclusively to international commercial disputes.
2.  The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre was established to facilitate only domestic arbitrations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is applicable to a wide range of arbitrations, including both domestic and international commercial disputes.  Its broad scope makes it a crucial piece of legislation in the ADR landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre (NDIAC) was specifically established to facilitate international commercial arbitrations, offering a neutral and efficient platform for resolving such disputes.  While it may also handle some domestic cases, its primary focus is on international matters.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, allows for the admissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence with the same legal effect as paper records, but explicitly prohibits the use of oral evidence given electronically in court proceedings.
2.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, applies to the processing of digital personal data within India only, regardless of whether the processing is done by an Indian entity or a foreign entity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, explicitly *does* allow for oral evidence to be given electronically.  This is a key feature of the Act, designed to modernize legal proceedings and accommodate technological advancements. The statement misrepresents this crucial aspect of the legislation.  The Act aims to streamline the acceptance of electronic evidence in Indian courts, ensuring that digital records have the same standing as traditional paper documents.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, applies to the processing of digital personal data *both* within and outside India if that processing is for offering goods or services in India.  The Act's extraterritorial reach is designed to protect Indian citizens' data even when it's processed by entities based outside the country.  This reflects a growing global trend towards data protection laws with broader jurisdiction.


Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate, making (d) the correct answer.


**2. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that consent is always required for processing personal data, with no exceptions for legitimate government purposes or emergencies.
2. The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) has the power to impose financial penalties on data fiduciaries for breaches of the Act's provisions, but it lacks the authority to direct data fiduciaries to take remedial measures following data breaches.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act emphasizes obtaining consent for processing personal data, it does provide exceptions.  Consent is not required for certain "legitimate uses," including the provision of government benefits or services and medical emergencies.  This exception is crucial for ensuring the efficient functioning of essential public services and emergency response systems.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The DPBI does have the power to impose financial penalties on data fiduciaries for violations of the Act.  Importantly, it also has the authority to direct data fiduciaries to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach. This includes directing remedial actions to mitigate the impact of the breach and prevent future occurrences.  This power is essential for effective enforcement of the Act and protection of data principal rights.


Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the provisions of the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.


**3. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only in cases where the death penalty has been imposed by a court-martial.
2.  A curative petition is the final constitutional remedy available to a person whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it can be filed only if there’s evidence of a violation of the principles of natural justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in a broader range of cases than just those involving the death penalty imposed by a court-martial.  The President's power extends to cases where sentences are imposed by courts-martial, for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power, and, significantly, for any offense where a death sentence is involved.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the President's powers under Article 72.


Statement 2 is partially correct but incomplete. A curative petition is indeed the final constitutional remedy available after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court. However, the grounds for filing a curative petition are not limited solely to violations of natural justice.  A curative petition can also be filed if a judge failed to disclose a connection with the subject matter or if there's an apprehension of bias that adversely affected the petitioner's case. The statement oversimplifies the grounds for a curative petition.


Therefore, neither statement is completely accurate in its entirety.


**4.  With reference to the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), 1973, consider the following statements:**

1. The CrPC mandates forensic investigation only for offences resulting in the death of a victim.
2.  The CrPC empowers a Magistrate to order any person to provide specimens such as signatures, handwriting, finger impressions, and voice samples, but only with the consent of the accused.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CrPC, 1973, does *not* limit mandatory forensic investigation solely to cases resulting in death.  Forensic investigation is mandatory for offences punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment, covering a much broader range of serious crimes.  The statement wrongly restricts the scope of mandatory forensic investigation.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The CrPC empowers a Magistrate to order the provision of specimens (signatures, handwriting, finger impressions, voice samples) without necessarily requiring the consent of the accused.  This power is essential for effective investigation and prosecution of crimes, particularly in cases where obtaining consent might be difficult or impossible. The statement wrongly implies that consent is always a prerequisite.


Therefore, neither statement accurately represents the provisions of the CrPC, 1973.


**5. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a statutory body established under the Indian Constitution.
2. The panel that selects the CBI Director consists of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is *not* a statutory body established under the Indian Constitution. It's a non-statutory and non-constitutional body governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.  The statement incorrectly attributes constitutional status to the CBI.


Statement 2 is correct.  The selection committee for the CBI Director does indeed comprise the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India. This composition reflects the importance of ensuring the CBI's independence and impartiality in its investigative functions.  The statement accurately describes the composition of this crucial selection panel.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and significantly broadened the scope of access to information for citizens.
2.  The RTI Act provides for a time frame of 48 hours for providing information in all cases, regardless of the nature of the request.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and it substantially expanded the rights of citizens to access information held by public authorities. The 2005 Act strengthened the provisions for transparency and accountability in governance compared to its predecessor.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RTI Act mandates a swift response, it does *not* impose a uniform 48-hour deadline for all requests.  The 48-hour timeframe applies specifically to requests concerning life or liberty, highlighting the urgency in such cases.  For other requests, the standard timeframe is 30 days. The statement incorrectly generalizes the time frame for all requests.


Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar is a 16-digit unique identification number issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI).
2. The Supreme Court of India has ruled that Aadhaar is an authoritative proof of date of birth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a *12-digit*, not a 16-digit, unique identification number issued by the UIDAI. This is a fundamental detail about the Aadhaar system. The statement contains a numerical inaccuracy.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court of India has *not* ruled that Aadhaar is an authoritative proof of date of birth. While Aadhaar can be used as evidence of identity, the court has clarified that it's not the sole or definitive proof of date of birth. Other documents might be required to verify date of birth. The statement misrepresents the Supreme Court's position on Aadhaar's evidentiary value regarding date of birth.


Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**8. With reference to the "right to be forgotten," consider the following statements:**

1. The "right to be forgotten" is explicitly recognized and defined in the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.
2.  The concept of the "right to be forgotten" originates from French jurisprudence and is similar to the right to data erasure under Europe's GDPR.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* explicitly mention or define the "right to be forgotten."  While the Act protects personal data and grants individuals certain rights, including data erasure in specific circumstances, it does not explicitly use or codify the "right to be forgotten" as a distinct legal right.  The statement falsely claims the Act's explicit inclusion of this right.


Statement 2 is correct. The concept of the "right to be forgotten" does indeed trace its origins to French jurisprudence, and it aligns closely with the right to data erasure under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  Both concepts focus on an individual's ability to have their personal data removed from public access under certain conditions.  The statement accurately describes the origins and conceptual similarity of the "right to be forgotten" and the GDPR's data erasure provision.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were launched in 2019 as a state-sponsored scheme under the Nirbhaya Fund.
2. The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, but not rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs were launched as a *centrally*, not state-sponsored scheme, under the Nirbhaya Fund.  The funding and implementation come from the central government, not individual states. The statement misidentifies the sponsorship level of the FTSC initiative.


Statement 2 is incorrect.  The objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of *both* rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act.  These courts are designed to address a range of serious sexual offenses, not just those covered by the POCSO Act. The statement mistakenly limits the scope of FTSC jurisdiction.


Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**10. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution of India.
2. The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and recommend appropriate action to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional body. It was established under Article 338 of the Constitution, but its powers and functions are further defined by the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and subsequent amendments.  The statement incorrectly claims constitutional status for the NCSC.


Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC does indeed have the power to investigate complaints regarding atrocities against Scheduled Castes and recommend appropriate action to the government. This investigative and recommendatory power is crucial for ensuring the protection of the rights of Scheduled Castes. The statement accurately reflects one of the NCSC's core functions.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offenses against laws relating to matters where the Union's executive power extends.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial or a civil court for any offense.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is given by a court-martial, for offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a death sentence.  It's not limited to only offenses under Union executive power.  The scope is broader than what statement 1 suggests.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 encompasses both court-martial sentences and sentences from civil courts for any offense.  The President's mercy power is not restricted to a specific type of court or a narrow category of offenses. This is a crucial aspect of the President's role in the Indian judicial system, acting as a check and balance.  The power extends to all types of sentences, including those involving capital punishment.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a review petition and is the final legal recourse available in the Indian judicial system.
2.  The Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India as a distinct power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition. It's a mechanism to address exceptional situations where there are serious flaws in the judicial process that were not addressed earlier.  This ensures that there is a final avenue for redressal of grave injustices.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction allows it to correct its own judgments, this power isn't explicitly mentioned as a separate, distinct power in the Constitution.  The power is derived from Article 142, which gives the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice, but it is not explicitly named as "curative jurisdiction".  The concept evolved through judicial interpretation and precedents.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established under a state-sponsored scheme funded entirely by individual state governments.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are established under a centrally sponsored scheme, not a state-sponsored one.  The funding is primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund, which is a central government initiative.  States do play a role in implementation, but the financial backing is largely central.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core purpose behind setting up FTSCs is to ensure swift justice in cases related to sexual offenses against women and children. The aim is to reduce the backlog of cases and provide timely justice to victims, a crucial aspect of addressing these sensitive crimes.  The focus on speedy trials is a key feature of these courts.


**4. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act introduces stringent penal provisions for various offenses related to postal services.
2.  The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) will have the authority to regulate charges for postal services and the sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A notable feature of the Post Office Act, 2023, is the *absence* of penal provisions.  The previous Act had some, but the 2023 Act omits them, focusing instead on streamlining postal services and governance.

Statement 2 is correct. The DGPS, appointed under the new Act, will have significant regulatory powers, including setting charges for services and managing the sale of postage stamps. This gives the DGPS greater control over the financial and operational aspects of India Post.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) accreditation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NHRC's 'A' status accreditation by GANHRI is a permanent designation, not subject to review.
2.  The recent deferral of NHRC accreditation by GANHRI was primarily due to concerns regarding staff and leadership diversity and insufficient action to protect marginalized groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 'A' status accreditation by GANHRI is not permanent and is subject to periodic review. The NHRC's accreditation has been deferred in recent years, highlighting the importance of continuous assessment and improvement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The reasons cited by GANHRI for deferring the NHRC's accreditation focus on the lack of diversity within the commission and insufficient measures to protect marginalized communities. These are significant concerns related to the effectiveness and impartiality of a human rights institution.


**6. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments, NGOs are permitted to utilize up to 50% of foreign funds for administrative expenses.
2.  The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), aided by the Intelligence Bureau, is responsible for the implementation and oversight of the FCRA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA *reduced* the permissible limit for administrative expenses from 50% to 20%. This stricter regulation aims to ensure that the majority of foreign funds are used for the intended purposes of the NGOs.

Statement 2 is correct. The MHA, with support from the Intelligence Bureau, is responsible for implementing and monitoring the FCRA. The Intelligence Bureau's involvement in investigations enhances scrutiny and accountability in the process of approving or rejecting foreign funding applications.


**7. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005 replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was enacted following the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in the 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government' case.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P) is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005, did replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, the timeline is inaccurate. The Supreme Court's decision in the 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government' case played a significant role in establishing the right to information as a fundamental right, but the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, was not a direct consequence of this case.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Personnel and Training under the MoPPG&P acts as the coordinating agency for the implementation and oversight of the RTI Act. This demonstrates the government's commitment to transparency and accountability.


**8. With reference to the Finance Commission's role in India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by state governments between the Union and the states.
2.  Horizontal devolution, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission, primarily considers factors like income distance, population, and area to distribute funds among states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the *Union* government (not state governments) between the Union and the states. This is a central aspect of India's fiscal federal system, ensuring a balance of resources between the center and the states.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 15th Finance Commission's horizontal devolution formula considered income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts as factors in distributing funds among states.  This reflects the attempt to balance different state needs and development priorities.


**9.  With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly defines the criteria and process for granting Special Category Status to states.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state has been granted SCS since then.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* explicitly define criteria or a process for granting Special Category Status.  The SCS was a policy decision based on recommendations of Finance Commissions, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively led to the phasing out of the SCS.  While states may receive special financial assistance through other mechanisms, the formal designation of SCS is no longer used.


**10. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule applies uniformly across all states in India, ensuring consistent administration of tribal areas.
2. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does *not* apply uniformly across all states.  It applies only to specific tribal areas in four states of Northeast India: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The unique administrative arrangements reflect the specific needs and contexts of these regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was included in the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, which was formed to address the governance of tribal areas in Assam.  This reflects the historical and political context of the provision's inclusion.


**11. With reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), 1973, consider the following statements:**

1. The CrPC, 1973 mandates forensic investigations only for offenses punishable by imprisonment of at least 10 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CrPC, 1973, mandates forensic investigation for offences punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment, not ten. This reflects the importance of scientific evidence in serious criminal cases.

Statement 2 is correct. The CrPC, 1973, provides the power to magistrates to order the collection of voice samples, along with other forms of identification like signatures, handwriting, and fingerprints, for investigation purposes.


**12. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (Indian Evidence Act, 2023), consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, explicitly allows for the admissibility of electronically recorded oral evidence in court proceedings. This is a significant step towards modernizing evidentiary procedures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act *permits* joint trials, specifically mentioning that the absconding of an accused does not prevent a joint trial from taking place. This is aimed at streamlining the judicial process.


**13. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee the implementation of the Act and hear grievances.
2. The Act mandates that all data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI to monitor compliance, impose penalties, address data breaches, and handle grievances. This is a crucial aspect of the Act's regulatory framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act mandates the appointment of a data protection officer and an independent data auditor only for *Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs)*, not all data fiduciaries. This differentiation reflects the varying levels of risk and sensitivity associated with data processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, but this is subject to the provisions of the *74th*, not the 73rd, Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander, a military officer, holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This reflects the historical context and the military's significant role in cantonment administration.


**15. With reference to the Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues and fundamental rights, consider the following statements:**

1. A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to a clean environment to Article 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court's recent judgment explicitly invoked Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression) in relation to climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court has indeed linked the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to Article 21 (right to life), expanding the scope of this fundamental right to encompass environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has used Articles 14 and 21 in relation to environmental issues, a recent ruling did not specifically invoke Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression) in the context of climate change.  The focus is primarily on the right to life and equality.


**1. With reference to the President's power of mercy, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to commuting death sentences, but not to pardoning those convicted by court-martial.
2.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and cannot be challenged in any court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in cases where the sentence is by a court-martial, for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a death sentence.  The statement incorrectly limits the President's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's decision carries significant weight, it's not entirely unchallengeable.  The Supreme Court has, in certain instances, examined the process and fairness of the President's decision-making in relation to mercy petitions, though direct judicial review of the decision itself is limited.  The President's decision is not absolutely impervious to judicial scrutiny concerning procedural aspects.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Curative Petitions:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition, and it is the final legal recourse available.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142, and it is mandatory for the Court to hear every curative petition filed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court. It is designed to address exceptional circumstances where serious errors of justice may have occurred.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the curative petition power flows from Article 142, it is not mandatory for the Supreme Court to hear every petition filed. The Court exercises its discretion to decide whether a curative petition merits consideration based on the exceptional nature of the alleged errors.  The Court’s power under Article 142 is not absolute and is subject to constitutional limitations and judicial pronouncements.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs are funded entirely by the state governments, with no central government contribution.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, but not rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The funding is not solely borne by the states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The stated objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of *both* rape cases and those under the POCSO Act. The scheme is designed to address both categories of crimes efficiently.


**4. With reference to internet shutdowns in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017, allows for internet shutdowns for an indefinite period based on the assessment of public emergency.
2.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the freedom of speech and expression through the internet is not an integral part of Article 19(1)(a).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2017 Rules permit temporary suspension of telecom services, including internet shutdowns, for a limited duration (up to 15 days at once) based on public emergency or public safety.  Indefinite shutdowns are not permitted under these rules.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India, explicitly held that freedom of speech and expression through the internet is an integral part of Article 19(1)(a), and any restriction must comply with Article 19(2).


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme:**

1.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a private company established to implement the CSC scheme.
2.  CSCs primarily serve urban populations, aiming to bridge the digital divide in cities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSC SPV is set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956.  It's not a private company but a government-established entity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSCs are designed to deliver government and other services to rural citizens across India, aiming to increase access to these services in less-connected areas.  Their primary focus is not urban populations.


**6. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WPFI is published annually by the United Nations.
2.  A higher ranking in the WPFI indicates a greater degree of press freedom in a country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI is released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based NGO, not the United Nations.

Statement 2 is correct. A higher ranking in the WPFI signifies a more favorable environment for press freedom, indicating less censorship and greater protection for journalists.  A lower ranking implies more restrictions and threats to press freedom.


**7. With reference to Affirmative Action in India and the US, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both India and the US constitution explicitly enshrine the principle of affirmative action.
2.  In India, affirmative action is primarily based on a quota system, while in the US, it is largely based on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's constitution explicitly provides for affirmative action through Articles 15(4) and 16(4), the US Constitution does not explicitly mention affirmative action.  The US approach is based on judicial interpretations of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.

Statement 2 is correct. India's affirmative action policies heavily rely on a quota system for reserved seats in education and employment, while the US approach focuses more on DEI programs, which encompass broader strategies to promote inclusivity.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC):**

1.  The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IV of the Constitution.
2.  The NCSC has the power to issue directions to both the Central and State Governments regarding the implementation of policies for Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, not a constitutional body.  It's not directly mentioned in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCSC has significant powers to investigate complaints, summon witnesses, and even issue directions to both Central and State Governments to ensure effective implementation of policies aimed at protecting and promoting the welfare of Scheduled Castes.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and incorporated several provisions from the previous Act.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and incorporated and strengthened many of its provisions, while also addressing some of its shortcomings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Central Information Commission's members (including the Chief Information Commissioner) are appointed by the President of India on the recommendation of a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister.


**10. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for the administration of areas exclusively used by military personnel.
2.  The administration of cantonments falls under the purview of state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cantonments house military troops, they also include civilian populations.  Military stations are exclusively for military personnel; cantonments are a broader administrative unit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List), not the state governments.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change:**

1. The Supreme Court held that the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change is not a fundamental right under the Indian Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court's judgment was delivered in a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in a recent judgement, indicated that the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change could be linked to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Indian Constitution, implying it could be considered a fundamental right in certain contexts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The referenced Supreme Court judgment was indeed made within the context of a writ petition related to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, illustrating the intersection of environmental concerns and fundamental rights.


**12. With reference to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).
2. The BNS introduces provisions for mandatory forensic investigations for all types of offenses.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC), not the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).  The IPC remains in force, although it may undergo amendments or be replaced by separate legislation in future.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BNS mandates forensic investigations for offenses punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment, not all types of offenses.


**13. Consider the following statements about the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991:**

1. The Act prohibits the conversion of any place of worship from one religion to another after August 15, 1947.
2. The Act applies to all places of worship in India including those declared as nationally protected monuments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act freezes the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, preventing conversions after that date.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly exempts the disputed site at Ayodhya and places covered under the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act, 1958.  The application of the Act is not universal across all places of worship in India.


**14. With reference to preventive detention, consider the following statements:**

1.  Preventive detention requires a trial and conviction by a court before a person can be detained.
2.  The power to make laws on preventive detention rests solely with the Parliament, and State Legislatures have no such power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Preventive detention is specifically characterized by the detention of a person *without* trial or conviction, based on the apprehension of future harmful actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Both Parliament and State Legislatures have the power to enact laws on preventive detention, as permitted under Article 22 of the Constitution.  This power is not exclusive to the Parliament.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
2.  The President's power to commute a death sentence under Article 72 is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in cases where the sentence is by a court-martial, for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or in cases of a sentence of death.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power to only one category of offenses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court can review the *process* by which the President exercises their mercy powers (e.g., ensuring due process and fairness), the President's decision itself is not directly subject to judicial review.  The Supreme Court's role is limited to ensuring that the President's decision is not arbitrary or capricious, but it cannot overturn the President's decision on a mercy petition. The President's power under Article 72 is considered to be a discretionary power, albeit one that should be exercised judiciously and in accordance with established principles of justice and fairness.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2. The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court, not a writ petition.  Writ petitions are distinct remedies under Articles 32 and 226, addressing fundamental rights violations or other legal issues.  A curative petition specifically addresses concerns about a final judgment after all other appellate avenues have been exhausted, including the review petition under Article 137.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is derived from its inherent power under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice. This inherent power allows the court to address exceptional situations and rectify any miscarriage of justice, even after all other remedies have been exhausted.  The curative petition mechanism was established by the Supreme Court itself in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.* to provide an avenue for addressing exceptional instances of grave injustice.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments.
2.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008 provides the statutory backing for the establishment of FTSCs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, and their expenditure is borne by the central government from the Nirbhaya Fund.  State governments may contribute in terms of infrastructure or personnel, but the primary funding source is the central government. This reflects the national importance given to addressing sexual assault cases swiftly and efficiently.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs are established under a separate centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 (and extended until 2026)  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, deals with the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas at the village level to resolve petty disputes.  While both aim to improve access to justice, they are distinct initiatives with separate legal frameworks and objectives.


**4. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only the Supreme Court has the power to punish for contempt of court.
2.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish for contempt of court under Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively. This power is essential to maintain the authority and integrity of the judicial system and ensure the effective administration of justice.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately describes the distinction between civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt focuses on the willful disobedience of a court order, impacting the rights of the parties involved in the case. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or interfere with the judicial process, even if they are not directly related to a specific case.


**5. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act of 1924.
2. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the State List in the Seventh Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments are currently administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, not the 1924 Act.  The 2006 Act reflects more recent changes and developments in the administration of cantonments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The administration of cantonments is a subject matter of the Union List (Entry 3) in the Seventh Schedule, not the State List. This reflects the central government's role in managing military establishments and ensuring their effective functioning. The Union's control over this matter is crucial considering the strategic importance of cantonments.


**6. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* established a new fundamental right to a healthy environment.
2.  The right to life under Article 21 can be interpreted to include the right to a clean and healthy environment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* did not establish a completely *new* fundamental right.  Instead, the court affirmed that existing fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), encompass the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.  The court broadened the interpretation of existing rights, rather than creating a new one.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted Article 21 broadly to include various facets of a dignified life, including the right to a clean and healthy environment.  This interpretation recognizes the fundamental link between environmental protection and the right to life. The court's rulings reflect a progressive approach to environmental law, using existing constitutional provisions to address emerging environmental challenges.


**7. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not contain any provision for explicitly categorizing states as SCS states.  The SCS was a policy decision based on various factors, including geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  The lack of a constitutional provision underscores the flexibility and discretionary nature of the SCS classification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS classification, arguing that the existing system of special funding was no longer appropriate.  The Commission proposed a new approach to providing financial assistance to states based on objective criteria, rather than the discretionary SCS classification.  This shift reflected a broader effort to create a more equitable and transparent system of resource allocation among states.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in all states of India.
2.  ADCs have the power to make laws on subjects such as land revenue collection, but not on matters related to forest management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule applies only to specific tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, not all states of India. This targeted approach reflects the unique needs and circumstances of these areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs have the power to make laws on a wide range of subjects, including forest management, agriculture, land revenue collection, and other matters crucial for the autonomy and self-governance of tribal communities. The extensive powers granted to ADCs are intended to empower these communities and promote their development.


**9. With reference to the formation of new states, consider the following statements:**

1. A bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in either House of Parliament without the President's recommendation.
2. The Parliament's power to form new states is absolute and not subject to any limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's recommendation, as per Article 3.  This requirement ensures that the process is carefully considered and conforms to constitutional principles.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Parliament has the power to form new states, this power is not absolute.  There are implicit limitations, including considerations of national unity, geographical feasibility, and the rights of affected populations.  Judicial review can also play a role in ensuring that the process is carried out in a fair and just manner.


**10. With reference to the devolution of taxes between the Union and States, consider the following statements:**

1. The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and the States regarding the distribution of taxes.
2.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of taxes among different states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations are highly influential and generally followed, they are not legally binding on either the Union or the States.  The recommendations are advisory in nature, providing guidance on the distribution of taxes based on various factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of taxes between the Union and the States, not among different states. Horizontal devolution, on the other hand, refers to the distribution of the states' share among individual states.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the complexities of intergovernmental fiscal relations in India.


**11. With reference to Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1. Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is unconstitutional and violates Article 341(2).
2. The Supreme Court has upheld the principle of substantive equality in allowing sub-classification of Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court in *State of Punjab & Others v Davinder Singh & Others* has held that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is permissible to address varying degrees of backwardness within the SC community.  This decision recognizes that the SC population is not homogeneous and that some groups may face greater disadvantages than others.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's decision affirms the principle of substantive equality, recognizing that formal equality may not be sufficient to address historical injustices and inequalities.  Substantive equality aims to provide equal opportunities to all groups, taking into account their unique circumstances and needs.  The court's ruling reflects a nuanced approach to affirmative action, seeking to achieve a more equitable distribution of benefits.


**12. With reference to the Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.
2.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas are to be disposed of within six months of the filing of the appeal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the strict rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  They are guided by the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution at the village level.  This approach is designed to make the process less formal and more accessible to the ordinary citizen.

Statement 2 is correct.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas are to be disposed of within six months of the filing of the appeal. This time limit reflects the aim to ensure speedy justice at the village level.  This time-bound approach is intended to prevent delays and ensure that justice is delivered in a timely manner.  However,  the reality of achieving this timeframe may vary depending upon the caseload and judicial capacity.


**13. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi is primarily focused on providing traditional classroom-based training to government officials.
2. The 70-20-10 mandate emphasizes the importance of on-the-job learning and experiential learning in capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.  It utilizes a competency-driven approach, leveraging online platforms and blended learning methods to provide training that is relevant and effective for modern governance challenges.  Traditional classroom-based training forms only a small part of the overall capacity building strategy.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 70-20-10 mandate is a core principle of Mission Karmayogi, highlighting the importance of on-the-job learning (70%), peer learning (20%), and formal training (10%).  This approach recognizes that learning happens in multiple ways and that on-the-job experience and peer interaction are crucial for developing practical skills and competencies.  This reflects a modern and effective approach to capacity building, emphasizing the importance of practical application and real-world experience.


**14.  With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM), consider the following statements:**

1. The Comprehensive Guidelines for Handling Public Grievances mandate a 30-day timeline for grievance redressal.
2. The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is used to rank Ministries/Departments based on their grievance redressal performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Comprehensive Guidelines for Handling Public Grievances have reduced the timeline for effective grievance redressal to 21 days, from the previous 30 days. This reflects an effort to improve the efficiency and timeliness of grievance redressal.

Statement 2 is correct. The GRAI is indeed used to rank Ministries/Departments based on their performance in handling public grievances. This provides a comparative assessment and helps identify areas for improvement in grievance redressal systems.  The index provides valuable insights and helps to promote accountability and efficiency within government organizations.


**1. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are entirely designated as Protected Areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958.
2.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, mandates that foreigners require special permits to visit both Protected and Restricted Areas, with exceptions only for Bhutanese citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area, Sikkim is only partly designated as a Protected Area; a portion of Sikkim falls under the Restricted Area category as per the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  The statement incorrectly asserts that both states are wholly designated as Protected Areas. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the nuanced geographical classifications applied under the relevant orders.

Statement 2 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, explicitly outlines permit requirements for foreigners visiting both Protected and Restricted Areas.  The exception granted to Bhutanese citizens highlights the unique diplomatic and geographical relationship between India and Bhutan. This statement accurately reflects a key provision of the legislation.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific regulations governing access to sensitive border regions and the exceptions provided.  A superficial understanding of the subject might lead to choosing option (a) or (c), while a thorough understanding is required to pinpoint the precise inaccuracies in statement 1.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's Fiscal Federalism:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution outlines the tax bases for both the Union and State governments, with the distribution of revenue determined solely by the Finance Commission.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union government, such as corporation tax and income tax, are entirely allocated to the Union government without any sharing with the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Seventh Schedule does indeed delineate tax bases between the Union and States (Article 246), the distribution of revenue is not determined *solely* by the Finance Commission.  Other constitutional provisions, such as Article 269 and Article 270, play a role in this distribution. Moreover, the GST Council's recommendations significantly influence the allocation of GST revenue between the Centre and States (Article 269-A).  The statement oversimplifies a complex constitutional arrangement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union government, like corporation tax and income tax, are *not* entirely allocated to the Union government.  A significant portion of these revenues is shared with the States according to the recommendations of the Finance Commission (Article 270). The statement misrepresents the fundamental principle of revenue sharing in India's federal structure.  The question requires a precise understanding of the constitutional provisions governing fiscal federalism and the roles of different bodies, including the Finance Commission and the GST Council.


**3. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of States as SCS states, outlining the criteria for their designation.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the primary mechanism for allocating grants to SCS States before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS classification.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution of India does *not* explicitly provide for the categorization of States as Special Category States.  The SCS was a classification developed through policy decisions and recommendations of Finance Commissions, not a constitutional mandate.  This highlights the distinction between constitutional provisions and administrative classifications.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the primary mechanism used for allocating grants to SCS States before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS classification.  The statement accurately reflects the historical evolution of this policy, underscoring the shifting approaches to resource allocation among states.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the historical context of SCS, the role of Finance Commissions, and the understanding of the difference between constitutional provisions and administrative policies.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was established based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2.  The Sixth Schedule primarily applies to the governance of tribal areas in the Northeastern states of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was established based on the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  This highlights the importance of accurate attribution in understanding the origins of constitutional provisions.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall and differentiate between important committees and their contributions to constitutional development.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule primarily deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, providing a unique framework for governance and autonomy. This accurately reflects the primary function and application of this constitutional provision.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific application and reach of the Sixth Schedule within the Indian constitutional framework, distinguishing it from other related provisions.


**5.  With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is independent of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.
2.  The Station Commander of a Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, *in accordance with* the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.  The statement incorrectly portrays an independent relationship between the Act and the constitutional amendment, when in fact they are connected.  The question tests understanding of the legal framework governing Cantonment Boards and their relationship to broader constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a Cantonment serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board, reflecting the military's significant role in the administration of these areas. The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the administrative structure.  The question tests the candidate’s understanding of the administrative structure and the role of the military in the governance of Cantonments.  The nuanced relationship between the Cantonments Act and the 74th Amendment is a key element that needs careful consideration.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences is limited to offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.
2.  Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon individuals convicted by court-martials, irrespective of the nature of the offense.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Article 72 does indeed empower the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power, it's not *limited* to these offenses. The article's scope extends to any offense where the sentence is by a court-martial or a death sentence.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon individuals convicted by court-martials. This is a specific and independent grant of power, not contingent on the nature of the offense committed during military service.  The article clearly encompasses this aspect of presidential clemency.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems directly from its inherent powers under Article 142, which allows it to ensure complete justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the last resort available after the dismissal of a *review petition* (under Article 137), not a writ petition.  Writ petitions are a different avenue for legal redress. Confusing these two types of petitions misrepresents the procedural pathway for a curative petition.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's authority to entertain curative petitions is derived from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice. This inherent power allows the court to address exceptional situations and rectify potential injustices that might have occurred even after the review process.  The statement accurately identifies the constitutional basis of the court's curative jurisdiction.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are exclusively funded through the Nirbhaya Fund and managed directly by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other heinous crimes, including rape.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Nirbhaya Fund does bear the expenditure of FTSCs, it is not exclusively funded by this source. Furthermore, the implementation is undertaken by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development, although the latter ministry has a vital interest in their success. The statement incorrectly specifies the sole funding source and implementing ministry.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core objective of establishing FTSCs is to ensure the speedy trial and disposal of cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases. This aims to reduce the backlog of cases and provide quicker justice to victims.  The statement accurately reflects the purpose behind the creation of these specialized courts.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Governor's power to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) is restricted to states with significant tribal populations in the Northeast.
2. ADCs are mandated to have a minimum of 30 elected members, with the Governor nominating the remaining members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule's provisions, stemming from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, specifically empower the Governor to establish ADCs and ARCs in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. This is because these states have historically significant tribal populations and unique administrative needs. The statement accurately reflects the geographical limitation of the Governor's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ADCs consist of a maximum of 30 members, not a minimum.  The composition includes 26 elected members and 4 nominated by the Governor.  The statement incorrectly states a minimum membership and reverses the roles of elected and nominated members.


**5. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to form new states rests solely with the President of India, who can initiate the process without parliamentary approval.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament upon the recommendation of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President plays a crucial role, the power to form new states ultimately lies with Parliament, not solely with the President.  The President's role is to recommend the introduction of a bill, but Parliament must pass the bill for the formation to be legally valid. The statement incorrectly attributes sole power to the President.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill for the formation of a new state must be introduced in either House of Parliament only after receiving the President's recommendation. This reflects the federal structure of India's government, requiring both executive and legislative approval for such a significant change.


**6. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are exempt from the application of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but they must adhere to the principles of natural justice.
2.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases go directly to the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed not bound by the strict rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, they are obligated to uphold the principles of natural justice to ensure fairness and due process.  The statement accurately describes this aspect of their legal framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases go to the District Court, not directly to the Supreme Court.  The statement incorrectly identifies the appellate court, significantly misrepresenting the appeals process.


**7. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or obstruct the administration of justice.
2. The Supreme Court's power to punish for contempt of court is derived solely from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The statement accurately distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt focuses on disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a framework, the Supreme Court's power to punish for contempt also stems from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, which grant inherent powers to the Supreme Court and High Courts respectively. The statement incorrectly limits the source of the court's power.


**8. With reference to the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates the Right to be Forgotten as a fundamental right.
2.  The concept of RTBF originated in French jurisprudence and has been recognized as part of the right to life under Article 21 by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* explicitly mention or codify the Right to be Forgotten.  The statement incorrectly claims its inclusion in the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The concept of RTBF does indeed trace its roots to French jurisprudence, and the Supreme Court of India, in the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy case (2017), recognized it as an aspect of the right to life under Article 21.  The statement accurately reflects the origin and judicial recognition of RTBF in India.


**9. With reference to Inner Line Permits (ILPs), consider the following statements:**

1. ILPs are required for all Indian citizens wishing to enter protected areas in states like Arunachal Pradesh, regardless of their residency status.
2.  The ILP system was initially established to protect tribal cultures and regulate movement near international borders in Northeast India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While ILPs are required for many to enter protected areas in states like Arunachal Pradesh, they are not required for all Indian citizens.  NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders are not eligible for ILPs and must apply for different permits.  The statement incorrectly assumes a universal requirement for all Indian citizens.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aims of the ILP system are to protect the unique tribal cultures and regulate movement, especially near India's international borders in the Northeast.  This reflects the historical and security considerations behind its implementation.  The statement accurately describes the historical context and aims of the ILP system.


**10. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly categorizes certain states as Special Category States, outlining specific provisions for their development.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS status, replacing the earlier funding mechanisms with a different approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly categorize any states as Special Category States. While various special provisions exist under Articles 371 and others to address the unique needs of some states, there's no formal constitutional category of "Special Category State." The statement incorrectly asserts a constitutional basis for this categorization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS status and the associated funding mechanisms based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  A new funding pattern, based on other criteria and recommendations, was subsequently adopted. The statement accurately reflects this significant change in policy.


**11. With reference to Special Financial Packages for States, consider the following statements:**

1. Special financial packages are constitutionally mandated provisions for states facing significant socio-economic challenges.
2. The allocation of special financial packages is entirely discretionary, not determined by any specific criteria or formula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Special financial packages are not constitutionally mandated. They are provided under Article 282, which allows discretionary grants, but there is no constitutional obligation to provide them. The statement incorrectly implies a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. The allocation of special financial packages is indeed discretionary.  While needs may be considered, there's no set formula or criteria for their allocation.  The decision is based on various factors and political considerations, making it discretionary.


**12. With reference to the Sixth Schedule and its applicability, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule applies to all states with significant tribal populations in India.
2. The Sixth Schedule resulted from recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee and empowers Governors to establish ADCs and ARCs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's applicability is limited to specific states in Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram), not all states with significant tribal populations across the country.  The statement wrongly generalizes its territorial scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), indeed originated from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations and grants Governors the authority to create ADCs and ARCs in the designated states.  The statement accurately reflects the origins and powers granted under the Sixth Schedule.


**13.  With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly audits the accounts of all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts and was awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG's mandate, stemming from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, covers auditing at all three levels of PRIs and ULBs, though the actual on-the-ground work is often delegated.  The statement accurately reflects the CAG's overall responsibility.

Statement 2 is also correct. The AuditOnline application was indeed developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to streamline the auditing process and enhance accountability.  It did receive the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023, recognizing its contribution to improved governance.


**14. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments are exclusively administered by the Ministry of Defence, with no involvement from state governments.
2. Cantonment Boards are responsible for civic functions like public health and primary education, operating under the Cantonments Act, 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Defence has administrative control over cantonments,  state governments also have some indirect influence through interactions with the local populations and related issues.  The statement incorrectly asserts exclusive control by the Ministry of Defence.

Statement 2 is correct. Cantonment Boards are indeed responsible for providing various civic amenities, including public health, water supply, and primary education.  They function under the provisions of the Cantonments Act, 2006, which aligns with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act concerning local self-governance.


**15. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized the right to a pollution-free environment as a fundamental right under Article 21, separate from the right to life.
2.  A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the right to a healthy environment is increasingly recognized as integral to Article 21 (right to life), it is not explicitly stated as a separate fundamental right.  The statement incorrectly presents it as a distinct, independent right.

Statement 2 is correct.  A recent Supreme Court judgment did indeed link the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), expanding the scope of these fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.  The statement accurately reflects this judicial development.


**16. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Information Commission (CIC) members are appointed by the President based on recommendations from a committee chaired by the Speaker of Lok Sabha.
2. Cooperative societies registered under state-level cooperative societies acts are always considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The committee recommending CIC members is chaired by the Prime Minister, not the Speaker of Lok Sabha.  The statement incorrectly identifies the chairperson of the appointment committee.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Judicial pronouncements have varied on whether cooperative societies are considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act.  The status depends on factors like the level of government funding and control.  The statement presents an oversimplified and incorrect generalization.  Some courts have ruled against considering them Public Authorities.


**17. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the tax bases for both the Union and State governments, defining their respective revenue streams.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union government, such as corporation tax, are entirely retained by the Union and not shared with State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Seventh Schedule does indeed delineate the tax powers between the Union and State governments, forming the basis of India's fiscal federalism.  The statement accurately reflects this crucial constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Union government levies and collects taxes like corporation tax, some revenue is shared with State governments through various mechanisms, including the Finance Commission's recommendations.  The statement incorrectly asserts complete retention by the Union.  A portion is shared with the states, making the statement false.


**18. With reference to the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to enhance people’s participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) by organizing structured Gram Sabhas and Ward Sabhas.
2. The campaign exclusively focuses on the Gram Panchayat level, excluding the involvement of Block and District Panchayats in the planning process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's core objective is to promote greater public participation in PDP preparation through structured meetings at various levels, including Gram Sabhas, Ward Sabhas, and even Block and District Sabhas.  The statement accurately reflects this participatory approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The campaign's scope extends beyond the Gram Panchayat level, actively involving Block and District Panchayats in the planning process.  The statement incorrectly limits the campaign's reach to only the Gram Panchayat level.  The campaign is multi-tiered, encompassing all three levels.



**1. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) to regulate charges for services but not the supply and sale of postage stamps.
2.  The Act explicitly outlines penal provisions for violations related to postal services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Post Office Act, 2023, grants the DGPS authority to create regulations covering various aspects of postal services, including the pricing of services and the distribution and sale of postage stamps.  The Act aims to provide a comprehensive framework for the regulation of India Post's operations.  The omission of stamp regulation in statement 1 is a deliberate misdirection.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. A crucial aspect of the Post Office Act, 2023, is the absence of specific penal provisions.  While the Act establishes the DGPS's regulatory powers, it does not define penalties for non-compliance. This lack of penal clauses contrasts with many other regulatory frameworks and is a significant feature of this legislation.  This omission is designed to create a potentially misleading distractor in the MCQ.


**2. With reference to the powers of the Government concerning India Post, consider the following statements:**

1. The government's power to intercept postal articles is restricted to situations involving threats to national security and public order, excluding emergencies or public safety.
2. The government can intercept postal articles without any specific grounds if deemed necessary for maintaining law and order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The government's authority to intercept postal articles extends to a broader range of situations than solely national security and public order.  The specified grounds explicitly include emergencies and public safety, highlighting the government's extensive powers in such circumstances.  The narrowing of the grounds in statement 1 is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The government's power to intercept mail is not arbitrary.  It is explicitly linked to specific, defined grounds, ensuring that such actions are not taken capriciously.  The suggestion of unchecked power in statement 2 is a key distractor.  The legal framework intends to balance security concerns with individual rights, and this balance is obscured in the statement.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC's 'A' status accreditation by GANHRI is permanent and cannot be deferred.
2. The NHRC's headquarters are located in Mumbai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC's accreditation, while initially granted 'A' status, is subject to periodic review and can be deferred based on GANHRI's assessment of the commission's performance and adherence to international standards.  The suggestion of permanence in statement 1 is a false claim designed to confuse.  The process of accreditation emphasizes ongoing accountability and compliance.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The NHRC's headquarters are located in New Delhi, not Mumbai. This geographical error is a straightforward distractor that tests basic factual recall.


**4. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  NGOs registered under the FCRA can utilize up to 50% of foreign funds for administrative expenses.
2. The FCRA mandates the submission of annual returns, but there are no consequences for non-compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA have significantly reduced the permissible usage of foreign funds for administrative expenses to a maximum of 20%, down from 50%. This change reflects a stricter regulatory approach towards the utilization of foreign contributions. The inflated percentage in statement 1 is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The FCRA does include provisions for consequences in case of non-compliance with the regulations, including restrictions on the use of unutilized foreign contributions.  The claim of no consequences in statement 2 is factually inaccurate and designed to test knowledge of the Act's enforcement mechanisms.


**5. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states.
2. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly define the criteria for granting Special Category Status.  The criteria have evolved over time, based on recommendations from various Finance Commissions and government decisions.  The implication of a clear constitutional definition in statement 1 is false and designed to test understanding of the constitutional basis of SCS.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of the SCS system, leading to its eventual discontinuation.  The assertion of continuation in statement 2 is a key distractor, highlighting a significant change in the approach to state funding.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was enacted in the year 2000.
2.  The RTI Act mandates that information concerning life or liberty must be provided within 72 hours of the request.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005, did replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, the latter was enacted in 2002, not 2000. This subtle chronological error is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The RTI Act specifies a 48-hour timeframe, not 72 hours, for providing information crucial to life or liberty.  The alteration of the time frame is a deliberate attempt to test precise knowledge of the Act's provisions.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Aadhaar system:**

1. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) issues Aadhaar cards but cannot deactivate them.
2.  Aadhaar is considered definitive proof of date of birth by all government agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UIDAI possesses the authority to both issue and deactivate Aadhaar cards, reflecting its role in managing the system's integrity.  The limitation of UIDAI's power in statement 1 is a false claim designed to test understanding of the UIDAI's operational capabilities.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Aadhaar can be used to establish identity, the Supreme Court has clarified that it is not definitive proof of date of birth.  This highlights the need to understand the legal limitations of Aadhaar's use and the importance of corroborating information from multiple sources.  The assertion of definitive proof in statement 2 is a deliberate misconception.


**8. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI's decisions are subject to appeal in the Supreme Court of India.
2. The DPBI is responsible for directing data fiduciaries to take action in case of data breaches.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are made to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court of India.  This substitution of appellate bodies is a common distractor technique used in questions on regulatory frameworks.

Statement 2 is correct.  The DPBI has the explicit power to direct data fiduciaries to take remedial measures in the event of data breaches, reflecting its role in enforcing data protection regulations.  This highlights the DPBI's enforcement powers.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule primarily addresses the administrative needs of tribal areas in the northeastern states.
2. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule is concerned with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India. It outlines a unique system of governance designed to address the specific needs and challenges of these regions.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Sixth Schedule was included in the Constitution following the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, which studied the governance challenges in the tribal areas of Assam.  This illustrates the historical context and the committee's influence on constitutional provisions.


**10. With reference to the Mercy Petition process in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India can commute a death sentence but cannot pardon a person convicted of an offense.
2. The President's power to grant pardons extends to offences against any law, regardless of whether the executive power of the Union extends to that matter.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's power under Article 72 includes the ability to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions, and commutations of sentences.  The limitation on pardoning power in statement 1 is a factual error designed to test knowledge of the President's constitutional powers.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Article 72 specifies that the President's pardon power applies to offences where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  The removal of this limitation in statement 2 is a deliberate attempt to mislead.


**1. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments, NGOs are required to obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds, mandating Aadhaar submission for every office-bearer.
2.  The FCRA permits the transfer of funds received in the designated FCRA account to other NGOs for collaborative projects, subject to certain conditions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The 2020 amendments to the FCRA significantly tightened regulations on foreign funding for NGOs.  A key change was the mandatory requirement for prior permission and the submission of Aadhaar details for all office-bearers. This aimed to enhance transparency and accountability in the receipt and utilization of foreign funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FCRA explicitly prohibits the transfer of funds received in the designated FCRA account to any other person or NGO.  The designated account is solely for the purpose of receiving foreign contributions and cannot be used for any other financial transactions, including transferring funds to other organizations, even for collaborative projects.  This restriction is a core element of the FCRA's regulatory framework designed to prevent misuse of foreign funds.  Any collaborative efforts must involve separate funding streams adhering to the FCRA guidelines.


**2. With reference to the devolution of taxes in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations determine the share of divisible pool taxes allocated to states, currently standing at 51%.
2.  Horizontal devolution among states considers factors like population (2011 census) and forest cover, with varying weights assigned to each criterion by the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission does recommend the vertical devolution of taxes (the share of the divisible pool allocated to states), the current percentage is 41%, not 51%. This figure represents the portion of central taxes that are shared with the states, a crucial aspect of India's fiscal federalism.  The exact percentage varies based on the recommendations of each Finance Commission.

Statement 2 is correct.  Horizontal devolution, the distribution of funds among states from their allocated share, indeed uses various criteria.  The 15th Finance Commission considered factors such as income distance, area, population (based on the 2011 census), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts, assigning different weights to each criterion to ensure equitable distribution.  This reflects the Commission's mandate to balance the needs of different states based on multiple socio-economic factors.


**3. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduces stringent penal provisions for postal employees found guilty of misconduct or negligence leading to loss or damage of postal articles.
2. The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) is empowered to make regulations concerning charges for postal services and the supply and sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Post Office Act, 2023, notably *lacks* stringent penal provisions.  While the Act outlines the responsibilities of postal employees, it doesn't detail specific penal actions for misconduct or negligence. This is a significant departure from previous legislation and could potentially create challenges in ensuring accountability within the postal system.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act grants the DGPS wide-ranging powers, including the authority to make regulations on various aspects of postal services. This includes the power to set charges for services and regulate the supply and sale of postage stamps, reflecting the DGPS's crucial role in managing India Post's operations and financial aspects. This empowerment is intended to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in the postal service's functioning.


**4. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for granting SCS are explicitly defined in the Constitution of India, ensuring transparency and consistency in the process.
2.  The grant of SCS involves financial assistance and preferential treatment for states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The criteria for granting Special Category Status (SCS) are *not* explicitly defined in the Constitution.  The decision to grant SCS is based on factors like geographical disadvantages, socio-economic backwardness, and strategic importance, assessed case-by-case by the Finance Commission.  This lack of codified criteria can lead to inconsistencies and debates regarding the eligibility of particular states.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary purpose of granting SCS is to provide additional financial assistance and preferential treatment to states that face significant challenges due to geographical limitations or socio-economic backwardness. This includes special concessions in taxation, central funding, and other developmental initiatives to bridge the development gap between these states and others.  The goal is to address the specific needs of such states and promote balanced regional development.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC):**

1. The NHRC’s Chairperson and Members are appointed by the President of India for a term of five years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court while investigating human rights violations, including the power to summon witnesses and requisition public records.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Chairperson and Members of the NHRC are appointed for a term of three years, or until they attain the age of 70, whichever is earlier, not five years and 65 years.  This tenure ensures continuity and stability in the Commission's functioning while also limiting the potential for undue influence.  The appointment process involves a committee headed by the Prime Minister, reflecting the importance of this institution.

Statement 2 is correct. The NHRC indeed has extensive powers akin to those of a civil court to effectively investigate human rights violations. This includes the ability to summon witnesses, examine them under oath, requisition public records, and receive evidence on affidavits. These powers are crucial for the NHRC to conduct thorough investigations and hold perpetrators accountable. The Commission's investigative powers are essential to its mandate of upholding human rights.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was deemed inadequate in promoting transparency and accountability.
2.  The Act mandates that all information held by private entities, regardless of whether it is in the public interest, be made accessible to any citizen upon request.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. The 2002 Act was considered insufficient in providing citizens with effective access to information held by public authorities. The 2005 Act significantly broadened the scope of information access and strengthened the mechanisms for its implementation, making it a more robust tool for promoting transparency and accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RTI Act applies primarily to *public authorities*, not private entities. While some information held by private entities might be accessible through other legal avenues, the RTI Act specifically focuses on information under the control of government bodies and other designated public authorities. This distinction is crucial in understanding the scope and limitations of the RTI Act.  The Act's focus on public authorities ensures transparency and accountability within the government and its related organizations.


**7. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that Data Fiduciaries must obtain explicit consent from Data Principals for all forms of data processing, without any exceptions.
2. The Act establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) with the power to impose penalties on Data Fiduciaries for non-compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPDP Act does not mandate explicit consent for *all* forms of data processing.  While consent is a crucial element, the Act allows for exceptions in certain situations, such as those deemed necessary for providing government services, medical emergencies, or other legitimate purposes specified within the Act. This reflects a balanced approach that recognizes both the need for data protection and the practical requirements of various sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the DPBI, granting it significant powers, including the authority to impose penalties on Data Fiduciaries for violations of the Act's provisions.  This enforcement mechanism is critical for ensuring compliance with data protection regulations and safeguarding the rights of individuals.  The DPBI plays a central role in overseeing the implementation and enforcement of the Act.


**8.  With reference to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rules mandate the immediate disqualification of any candidate found to be using unfair means in a public examination, regardless of the nature or severity of the offense.
2.  The Rules establish a mechanism for constituting a committee to investigate cases involving the possible complicity of service providers in facilitating unfair means.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules do not mandate immediate disqualification for *all* instances of unfair means. The response to unfair means will vary depending on the severity and nature of the offense. While the rules aim to deter such practices, they provide a framework for addressing such cases, which may involve various penalties depending on the specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules do indeed establish a mechanism for investigating cases where service providers might be involved in facilitating unfair means. This highlights the recognition that unfair practices in examinations could involve external actors, not just the candidates themselves.  The formation of a committee to investigate such cases is a crucial step towards ensuring the integrity of public examinations.  This demonstrates a proactive approach to maintaining the fairness and credibility of the examination system.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the  Cantonment Boards in India:**

1. Cantonment Boards are established under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are administered by the Ministry of Defence.
2. Recent policy changes have mandated the complete dissolution of all Cantonment Boards and their merger with the respective municipal corporations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonment Boards in India are indeed established under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and fall under the administrative purview of the Ministry of Defence. These boards are responsible for the civic administration and governance of cantonment areas, which house military installations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While there have been discussions and some instances of merging certain land portions of Cantonment Boards with local bodies, there is no policy mandating the complete dissolution of *all* Cantonment Boards and their merger with municipal corporations. The status and functioning of Cantonment Boards remain a matter of ongoing policy considerations and debate.  The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex policy issue.


**10. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on providing digital literacy training to rural populations, with limited involvement in other government service delivery.
2. CSC SPV, a special purpose vehicle set up under the Companies Act, 1956, oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are not solely focused on digital literacy training. While digital literacy is a component of their services, CSCs play a far broader role in delivering various government and private sector services to rural areas. They act as a crucial bridge between citizens and various service providers, offering a range of services from government-to-citizen (G2C) to business-to-citizen (B2C) interactions.

Statement 2 is correct.  CSC SPV, established under the Companies Act, 1956, is indeed responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Common Services Centre (CSC) scheme. It provides the organizational and managerial framework for the extensive network of CSCs across India, playing a central role in coordinating their operations and ensuring their effectiveness in service delivery.  The SPV's role highlights the importance of a robust organizational structure for the success of the CSC scheme.


**1. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. Aadhaar metadata can be stored indefinitely by the UIDAI for security purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, but it is explicitly *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile.  The Supreme Court has affirmed this distinction.  Confusing Aadhaar's purpose with citizenship status is a common misconception.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act mandates that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This is crucial for protecting the privacy of individuals and preventing potential misuse of the data.  The UIDAI is bound by this legal constraint.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented by state governments.
2. The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes are jointly funded by the central and state governments. The funding is shared, with the central government contributing a larger portion, but state participation is essential.  The implementation is carried out through state governments, but the funding is a collaborative effort.

Statement 2 is correct.  The current structure and functioning of CSSs are indeed based on the recommendations and report produced by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs in 2015. This report aimed to streamline the system and improve efficiency.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians and have resided in India since before December 31, 2015.
2. The CAA reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants from 11 years to 6 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA specifies that illegal migrants must have entered India on or before December 31, 2014, not 2015, to be eligible for citizenship.  This cutoff date is a key element of the Act and its stipulations.  The other religious requirements mentioned are accurate.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The CAA does reduce the naturalization period, but it reduces it to 5 years, not 6 years, for the specified categories of migrants.  While the difference is slight, accuracy is paramount in this context.


**4. With reference to Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of External Affairs has recently announced the revocation of all existing OCI cards.
2.  OCI cardholders enjoy all the rights of an Indian citizen except the right to vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of External Affairs has *not* announced the revocation of all existing OCI cards.  In fact, the ministry has explicitly stated that the existing OCI rules remain unchanged.  Spreading misinformation about OCI card status is inaccurate and potentially harmful.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While OCI cardholders do *not* have the right to vote, they also lack several other rights enjoyed by Indian citizens.  The statement oversimplifies the limitations associated with OCI status.  It’s not just voting rights; OCI status carries other restrictions.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in a broader range of cases, including those involving court-martials and offenses against Union laws, but not limited to only those.  The scope of the President's power is wider than the statement suggests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's decision carries significant weight, it is not entirely beyond judicial review. The Supreme Court can, in certain circumstances, examine the process and the fairness of the decision-making related to mercy petitions, although direct overruling is rare.


**6.  With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the final recourse available to a litigant after their review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  It serves as a last resort to address significant errors of justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly mention curative petitions. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is derived from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice, which is interpreted to include the ability to correct its own errors.


**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are entirely funded by state governments.
2. FTSCs handle only cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning they are primarily funded by the central government from the Nirbhaya Fund. While states might contribute, the major funding comes from the center.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs handle cases of rape and those under the POCSO Act.  The scope is not limited exclusively to POCSO cases; rape cases are also a significant part of their jurisdiction.  The statement misrepresents the breadth of their mandate.


**8. With reference to the Right to Information Act (RTI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act mandates disclosure of all information held by public authorities, without any exceptions.
2.  The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, empowered the Central Government to determine the terms of service for Information Commissioners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act does have certain exemptions from disclosure, notably information related to national security, personal information, and other categories specified in Section 8.  The statement wrongly implies absolute transparency without acknowledging these crucial limitations.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019 did indeed grant the Central Government more authority over the terms and conditions of employment for Information Commissioners at both the central and state levels, including salaries and allowances.


**9.  With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India.
2. The Sixth Schedule applies uniformly to all states in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), establishes autonomous district councils in four states of Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram) to safeguard the interests of tribal communities. These councils have significant administrative and legislative powers within their respective areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's application is specifically limited to those four states in Northeast India; it does not apply universally across all states of the country.  The statement ignores the geographical and political limitations of the Schedule's applicability.


**10. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are located at the headquarters of the district panchayats.
2. Gram Nyayalayas are bound by the rules of evidence specified in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, when settling disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, they are located at the headquarters of *intermediate* panchayats, not district panchayats.  The statement misidentifies the administrative level at which these courts are situated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate under the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible and accessible dispute resolution process.  The statement misrepresents the evidentiary standards used in these courts.  The recent replacement of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, with Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam does not affect this.


**11. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly defines the criteria for classifying a state as a Special Category State.
2. Special Category Status is granted to states based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly define criteria for designating a state as a Special Category State.  The categorization has evolved through government policies and recommendations of various committees and commissions.  The statement wrongly assumes a constitutional basis for the categorization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Finance Commissions' recommendations have historically influenced the provision of special financial assistance to certain states, the designation of Special Category Status itself is not directly determined by the Finance Commission.  The statement confuses financial assistance with formal status.  The 14th Finance Commission recommendations effectively ended the SCS.


**12. With reference to Special Packages for states, consider the following statements:**

1. Special Packages are provided to states based on a pre-defined formula and are mandatory for states meeting specific criteria.
2. Special Packages are provided under Article 282 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Special Packages are *not* provided based on a pre-defined formula or mandatory criteria. They are discretionary grants provided to states facing unique geographical, socio-economic, or other challenges.  The statement misrepresents the flexible and need-based nature of these packages.

Statement 2 is correct. Special Packages are additional grants provided under Article 282 of the Constitution, which empowers the central government to make discretionary grants for any public purpose.  This constitutional provision provides the legal basis for such assistance.


**13.  With reference to EVMs and VVPATs, consider the following statements:**

1.  VVPATs were first fully deployed in all constituencies during the 2014 Lok Sabha General Elections.
2. EVMs are manufactured only by public sector undertakings in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. VVPATs were fully deployed in all constituencies during the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections, not 2014.  The statement is inaccurate regarding the timeline of VVPAT implementation. Goa was the first state to use VVPATs with all EVMs during 2017 Legislative Assembly Election.

Statement 2 is correct.  EVMs used in Indian elections are manufactured and supplied by Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL), both public sector undertakings under the Ministry of Defence and Department of Atomic Energy respectively.  The statement accurately reflects the manufacturing source.


**14. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC was first introduced in 1970 for the Lok Sabha elections.
2. The Election Commission of India (ECI) is solely responsible for enforcing the MCC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960 for state assembly elections in Kerala, not in 1970 for Lok Sabha elections. The statement misrepresents the historical context of MCC introduction.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While the ECI lays down the MCC and plays a primary role in its enforcement, the successful implementation also relies on the cooperation of political parties, candidates, and the general public.  The statement oversimplifies the enforcement mechanism.  The ECI issues directives, but ultimate compliance depends on multiple actors.



**1. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aadhaar serves as proof of address and identity for residents of India, it is explicitly *not* proof of citizenship or domicile.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* emphasized this distinction.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes and documentation.  Domicile is determined by separate state-level laws and regulations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Supreme Court ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be compulsorily enforced for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  The government cannot force individuals to link Aadhaar to these services.  The judgment aimed to strike a balance between the government's need for efficient service delivery and the protection of individual rights, particularly the right to privacy.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1. CSSs are exclusively funded by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
2. The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers focusing on the rationalization of CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments. The funding is shared, not solely borne by the central government.  Furthermore, CSSs are implemented through state governments in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, not just the Union List.  The Concurrent List allows for shared legislative powers between the center and states.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework governing CSSs is indeed based on the recommendations and report produced in 2015 by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers established specifically to rationalize and improve the effectiveness of these schemes. This report significantly shaped the current structure and operational guidelines for CSSs.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA grants Indian citizenship to all illegal migrants residing in India, irrespective of their religion or country of origin.
2. The CAA reduces the naturalization period for certain religious minorities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan to 5 years.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA does *not* grant citizenship to all illegal migrants.  It specifically targets illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians and who have come from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan before December 31, 2014, and fulfill other specified conditions.  It is a targeted, not a universal, measure.  The Act excludes certain tribal areas and those under Inner Line Permit regulations.

Statement 2 is correct. A key provision of the CAA is the reduction of the naturalization period for the aforementioned religious minorities from the usual 11 years to 5 years.  This accelerated naturalization pathway is a central element of the Act's provisions.


**4. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996, and operate solely in rural areas.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are empowered to handle only civil disputes related to land ownership and inheritance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996. While they primarily function in rural areas, the Act exempts certain states and tribal areas.  Their jurisdiction extends beyond just rural areas in some instances.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Gram Nyayalayas have both civil and criminal jurisdiction to settle petty disputes at the village level. Their jurisdiction is not limited to land ownership and inheritance; they can address a broader range of minor legal issues.  They are designed to provide accessible and efficient justice at the local level.


**5. Regarding Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves publishing material that criticizes or undermines the authority of a court.
2. The Supreme Court and High Courts derive their power to punish contempt from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Civil contempt refers to willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings, not the publication of critical material.  Criminal contempt, on the other hand, involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court or obstruct the administration of justice.  The description in statement 1 aligns with criminal contempt, not civil contempt.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution explicitly grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the inherent power to punish for contempt of court. This power is essential for maintaining the dignity and authority of the judicial system.


**6. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at improving sanitation in rural areas.
2.  The Abhiyan focuses on preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) through participatory processes involving local communities and elected representatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as the People's Plan Campaign) is not specifically focused on sanitation. Its broader aim is to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs). While improved sanitation might be a component of a PDP, it is not the primary objective of the Abhiyan.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core function of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to promote participatory planning at the Panchayat level. This involves active engagement of elected representatives, frontline workers, community-based organizations, and other stakeholders in developing comprehensive PDPs for the future.  The Abhiyan emphasizes inclusive participation and local ownership of development initiatives.


**7.  With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is an international organization based in Geneva, Switzerland, that audits local governance bodies globally.
2. iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such center in India, aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is not an international organization with headquarters in Geneva. It is a center established *within* India, specifically inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat.  Its focus is on setting standards for auditing local governance within India, although it aspires to influence global best practices.

Statement 2 is correct.  The inauguration of iCAL in Rajkot marks the establishment of the first center of its kind in India. Its primary aim is to develop and implement robust auditing mechanisms for local governance bodies, with the goal of establishing high standards for accountability and transparency in local administration and to serve as a model for other countries.


**8.  With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act retains the existing framework for spectrum allocation, primarily through administrative means.
2. The Act brings Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms under its regulatory purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, shifts the primary method of spectrum allocation to auctions, while reserving administrative allocation for specific purposes like national security and disaster management.  The Act modernizes the spectrum allocation process, moving away from solely administrative methods.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act explicitly *does not* regulate Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.  The regulation of OTT platforms is considered a separate matter and remains outside the scope of this specific Act.


**9.  With reference to EVMs and VVPATs, consider the following statements:**

1. VVPATs were fully deployed across all polling stations in India during the 2014 Lok Sabha General Elections.
2.  Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) are the primary manufacturers of EVMs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While VVPATs were introduced to enhance transparency, their full deployment across all polling stations in India only happened during the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections, not 2014.  The 2017 Goa Legislative Assembly elections saw their first widespread use.

Statement 2 is correct.  Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (ECIL) are indeed the primary manufacturers of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) used in Indian elections.  These are Public Sector Undertakings (PSUs) under the Ministry of Defence and Department of Atomic Energy, respectively.


**10. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC was first introduced during the 1951 Lok Sabha elections.
2. The Election Commission of India (ECI) formulates the MCC in consultation with political parties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC was not first introduced during the 1951 Lok Sabha elections. It was first introduced during the 1960 Kerala State Assembly elections. The evolution of the MCC has been a gradual process, adapting to changing political circumstances and electoral practices.

Statement 2 is correct. The ECI plays a crucial role in formulating the MCC. It works in consultation and consensus with various political parties to ensure that the guidelines are widely accepted and reflect the concerns of all major participants in the electoral process.  The MCC is not imposed unilaterally by the ECI but rather developed through a collaborative process.


**11. With reference to the President's address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President is constitutionally mandated to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.
2. The form of oath taken by Members of Parliament is specified in the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President traditionally addresses both Houses of Parliament, the Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, modified Article 87(1)  allowing for the address to be made to either House separately or jointly.  The current practice is a joint address to both Houses.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The forms of oath taken by Members of Parliament are specified in the *Third* Schedule, not the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.  The Fourth Schedule deals with allocation of seats in the Council of States (Rajya Sabha).


**12.  With reference to the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for dual citizenship for Indian citizens.
2. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act, 1955, was added to address issues arising from the Assam Accord.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship Act, 1955, does *not* permit dual citizenship.  India follows the principle of single citizenship, meaning an individual can hold citizenship of only one country.  Dual citizenship is allowed in some other countries but not in India.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 6A, added through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, was a direct response to the Assam Accord and was designed to address the complex issue of citizenship determination in Assam, particularly concerning those who had migrated from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh).


**13. With reference to Mercy Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can only commute death sentences in cases involving offences against the laws relating to matters under the concurrent list.
2. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is by a court-martial.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 grants the President the power to commute sentences in cases where the sentence is for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. This includes offences under both the Union List and Concurrent List.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial. This reflects the President's role as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces.


**14. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the Supreme Court has dismissed a writ petition.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain a curative petition is derived from Article 142 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition can be filed only *after* the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition, not a writ petition.  The curative petition is the last resort after all other legal avenues, including review petitions, have been exhausted.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent power under Article 142 of the Constitution to do complete justice.  This power allows the Court to address exceptional circumstances where a miscarriage of justice might have occurred.


**15.  With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are state-funded courts established exclusively to handle cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. The FTSCs are implemented by the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs primarily deal with rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, they are not exclusively for POCSO cases.  They also handle other serious sexual assault cases.  Furthermore, FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored scheme*, not solely state-funded.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The implementation of FTSCs is carried out by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The Ministry of Law and Justice has the primary responsibility for overseeing the judicial system.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences is derived from Article 72 of the Constitution, exclusively applicable to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2.  A curative petition, the final constitutional remedy in the Supreme Court, can be filed only if the review petition has been dismissed and the petitioner demonstrates a violation of principles of natural justice or a judge's undisclosed connection with the case.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 does empower the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences, its application is not limited to court-martial cases.  It extends to offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, and crucially, it includes death sentences regardless of the court's jurisdiction. The statement wrongly restricts the scope of Article 72.

Statement 2 is largely correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort in the Supreme Court after a review petition is dismissed.  The grounds for filing a curative petition are precisely as stated: demonstrating a violation of natural justice principles, a judge's undisclosed connection, or an apprehension of bias significantly impacting the petitioner's case.  The statement accurately reflects the established legal precedent. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs, a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 and extended until 2026, are funded entirely by state governments and primarily handle cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The implementation of FTSCs falls under the purview of the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, aiming to expedite the disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, with a target of 1023 courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FTSCs were indeed launched in 2019 and extended until 2026, their funding is not solely from state governments.  The central government bears the expenditure, drawing from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The statement misrepresents the source of funding.  Further, while FTSCs handle POCSO Act cases, their mandate is broader, encompassing all rape cases.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for the implementation of FTSCs.  The objective, as stated, is to ensure swift disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.  The target of 1023 courts is also accurate, though the number of functional courts may differ. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and mandates that all personal information held by Public Authorities must be disclosed to citizens upon request.
2.  The RTI Act is coordinated by the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions, and the 2019 amendment empowered the central government to prescribe the terms of service for Information Commissioners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, it does *not* mandate the disclosure of all personal information.  Section 8 of the RTI Act provides exemptions for certain information, including personal information, to protect individual privacy.  The statement incorrectly asserts unconditional disclosure of all personal data.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions coordinates the RTI Act.  The 2019 amendment did empower the central government to define the terms of service for Information Commissioners, enhancing central control over their functioning. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of citizenship and domicile for Indian residents, issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), and its data is decentralized for enhanced security.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act upheld its constitutionality while mandating that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months and that Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing all government services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, it is *not* definitive proof of citizenship or domicile.  These require separate documentation.  The statement also incorrectly claims that Aadhaar data is decentralized; in reality, it's stored centrally, though with security measures in place.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment did uphold the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act and did stipulate that metadata should not be stored for more than six months. However, it did *not* mandate Aadhaar for *all* government services.  It clarified that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes but not for services like opening bank accounts or mobile connections.  The statement overstates the Supreme Court's ruling.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are funded solely by the central government and implemented by state governments, primarily in sectors falling under the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the 2015 report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, and the schemes are implemented only in states that were previously categorized as Special Category States (SCS).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSSs are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the center.  Further, while many CSSs operate in sectors under the Union List, they also cover areas in the State and Concurrent Lists.  The statement misrepresents both the funding and the constitutional jurisdiction of CSSs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report. However, the statement incorrectly claims that CSSs are implemented *only* in states that were previously Special Category States (SCS).  The categorization of states as SCS no longer exists, and CSSs are implemented across various states based on need and policy priorities. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**6.  With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, enshrined under Article 244(2), was a direct outcome of the recommendations of the Dar Commission, aiming to grant autonomy to tribal areas within the states.
2. The Sixth Schedule provisions apply uniformly across all tribal areas in India, establishing autonomous district councils with extensive legislative and executive powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule was a product of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, not the Dar Commission.  The Bardoloi Committee's work focused on the governance of Assam's tribal areas, leading to the inclusion of the Sixth Schedule in the Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule does not apply uniformly across all tribal areas in India.  It applies only to specific tribal areas in four northeastern states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Furthermore, while autonomous district councils are established, their powers are not unlimited and are subject to the overall authority of the state government.  The statement oversimplifies the scope and powers of the Sixth Schedule provisions. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**7. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments, established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Buxar in 1764, are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their civic functions are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2.  A Cantonment is an area primarily dedicated to housing military troops, encompassing both military and civilian populations, with the Station Commander acting as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cantonments were indeed established by the East India Company, but the Battle of Plassey (1757), not Buxar (1764), marks the significant turning point.  Furthermore, while the Cantonments Act, 2006, governs their administration, their civic functions fall under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The definition of a Cantonment, its dual population (military and civilian), and the Station Commander's role as ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board are all accurate. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**8. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's recent judgment, in the case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Rhinoceros and its habitat, established the right to a pollution-free environment as a fundamental right under Article 21.
2. The Supreme Court has consistently utilized its power of judicial review to expand the scope of fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 (right to equality), 21 (right to life), and 19 (right to freedom), to include environmental protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's judgment did relate to environmental protection, but it concerned the Great Indian Bustard, not the Great Indian Rhinoceros.  The judgment did not explicitly establish a "pollution-free environment" as a separate fundamental right but rather highlighted the connection between environmental degradation and the right to life (Article 21).

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court has indeed used its judicial review powers extensively to broaden the interpretation of fundamental rights to incorporate environmental concerns.  The Court has linked environmental rights to Articles 14, 21, and 19, demonstrating a proactive approach to environmental protection within the constitutional framework. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee are constituted solely by members of the Lok Sabha, with the Speaker appointing the Chairpersons of both committees.
2. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL), established in 1976 under the Official Languages Act, 1963, comprises members from both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, elected through a system of proportional representation by single transferable vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Estimates Committee is indeed composed solely of Lok Sabha members, the PAC includes members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The statement incorrectly restricts the PAC's membership to the Lok Sabha.  Furthermore, the Speaker does not appoint the chairpersons; they are elected by the respective committees.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCOL was established as stated, comprising members from both Houses of Parliament and utilizing the described proportional representation system for elections. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Election Commission of India (ECI) first introduced the MCC in 1971 during the Lok Sabha elections, and it is legally binding on all political parties and candidates.
2. The MCC is a set of guidelines aimed at ensuring free and fair elections by regulating the conduct of political parties and candidates, with the ECI having the power to enforce it through legal action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during Kerala State Assembly elections, not in 1971 during Lok Sabha elections.  While it is strictly adhered to, the MCC is not legally binding in the sense of having direct statutory backing. Its authority rests on the ECI's constitutional powers and the consensus among political parties.

Statement 2 is correct. The MCC's primary purpose is to ensure free and fair elections by regulating political conduct. While it lacks direct legal enforceability, the ECI's authority and the political pressure it exerts make non-compliance a significant risk for political actors.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states based on income distance, area, population (2011), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution permits state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the Union government's prior consent if the state is already indebted to the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  The statement accurately reflects the commission's allocation criteria, weighing factors like income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  This represents the vertical devolution aspect of fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state borrowing to within India.  States cannot borrow from foreign sources. While it's true that the Union government's prior consent is required if a state is already indebted to the Union before undertaking further borrowing, the statement's assertion about borrowing both within and outside India is factually inaccurate. This reflects a misunderstanding of the constitutional limitations on state financial autonomy.  The restriction on foreign borrowing safeguards the nation's financial stability and prevents potential complications in international financial markets.


**2. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants to states with Special Category Status, based on their geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the Special Category Status classification, replacing it with a need-based special funding pattern for certain states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the mechanism employed to distribute funds to states granted Special Category Status. This formula considered various factors to assess the developmental needs of these states, reflecting the historical context of providing additional financial assistance to regions facing unique challenges.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations resulted in the phasing out of the SCS classification.  While the specific criteria for special funding changed, the underlying principle of providing additional support to states requiring it continued. The shift from a categorical designation (SCS) to a need-based approach aimed for greater flexibility and responsiveness to evolving developmental needs. This decision reflects a shift in the approach to Centre-State financial relations, moving away from a rigid classification system towards a more dynamic and adaptable mechanism.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, established under Article 244(2), was formed based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.  It aims to provide a unique mechanism for the governance of tribal areas in specific states.
2.  The Sixth Schedule provisions apply to all states in India that have significant tribal populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was indeed a product of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations.  Its implementation is specifically targeted at certain states with substantial tribal populations, providing a framework for autonomous district councils to manage local affairs. This reflects the constitutional commitment to protecting and promoting tribal rights and self-governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does not apply to all states with significant tribal populations.  Its provisions have a specific geographical scope, applying only to certain areas within select states.  This targeted approach ensures that the unique characteristics and needs of these regions are addressed appropriately.  The limited scope of the Sixth Schedule reflects a pragmatic approach to administering diverse regions within the Indian federal system.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS):**

1.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes are funded entirely by the Central Government and implemented by the state governments.
2.  The current framework of CSSs is based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), focusing on schemes aligning with the National Development Agenda.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes are jointly funded by the Central and State governments, not solely by the Centre.  The shared funding reflects the cooperative federalism principle, emphasizing collaborative efforts between different levels of government.

Statement 2 is correct. The current structure of CSSs is indeed built upon the recommendations of the 2015 Sub-Group of Chief Ministers report.  This report aimed to streamline and rationalize the schemes, aligning them with national development priorities.  The focus on the National Development Agenda reflects the evolving approach to Centre-State relations and the emphasis on achieving national goals through collaborative governance.


**5. With reference to the Union and States' financial arrangements, consider the following statements:**

1. Taxes levied and collected by the Union, such as corporation tax and personal income tax, are wholly assigned to the states as per Article 269.
2.  Grants-in-aid provided by the Centre to states are based solely on the recommendations of the Finance Commission as per Article 275.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Union does levy and collect taxes like corporation tax and personal income tax, these are *not* wholly assigned to the states. A significant portion is retained by the Union, and a share is distributed to the states based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission,  Article 270  deals with this distribution, not a complete assignment to states. This reflects the complex revenue-sharing arrangements within India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations are crucial in determining the allocation of grants-in-aid, Article 275 also allows for discretionary grants by the Centre to states, not solely dependent on the Finance Commission's recommendations.  This element of flexibility allows the Centre to address unforeseen or emergency situations requiring immediate financial assistance to states.  This reflects the interplay between the structured and discretionary aspects of Centre-State financial relations.


**6. With reference to the borrowing powers of the Union and State Governments, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union government can borrow money only within India as per Article 292.
2.  If a state government is indebted to the Union, it needs the Union's prior consent before taking on any further borrowing, irrespective of the source.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 292 empowers the Union government to borrow both within and outside India. This reflects the Union's greater financial flexibility and its role in managing the nation's international financial relations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The condition of obtaining prior consent from the Union government before further borrowing applies if a state is already indebted to the Union. This safeguard ensures fiscal discipline and prevents states from accumulating unsustainable levels of debt.  This reflects the constitutional checks and balances in managing public finances and maintaining fiscal stability at both the Union and State levels.  The restriction applies irrespective of the source of the new borrowing, whether from domestic or international sources.


**7. Consider the following statements concerning the status of State Finances in India:**

1.  States' revenue sources cover more than 75% of their revenue expenditure.
2. The debt-to-GDP ratio of states was above 30% in March 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that states cover only 58% of their revenue expenditure from their own revenue sources, significantly less than 75%. This highlights the dependence of states on central transfers for a substantial portion of their funding requirements.  This dependence reflects the complexities and challenges in managing state finances within the framework of India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that the debt-to-GDP ratio of states stood at 27.5% in March 2023, not above 30%. This figure reflects the overall fiscal health of states, indicating the level of indebtedness relative to their economic output.  While 27.5% is a significant figure, it's crucial to have accurate data when assessing the fiscal health of states.  The difference between the stated figure and the actual figure illustrates the importance of precise data when analyzing economic and fiscal indicators.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the provided text, some questions may be more challenging than others to create with sufficient complexity and plausible distractors while maintaining factual accuracy and avoiding obvious answers.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, prioritizing income distance as the most heavily weighted criterion in horizontal devolution.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution permits state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, provided they secure prior consent from the Union Government if already indebted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states and gave the highest weight to income distance in the horizontal devolution criteria.  Other factors like area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts were also considered but with lower weights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing outside India. They can borrow within India, but if they are already indebted to the Union Government, further borrowing requires the Union's prior consent.  The statement incorrectly combines the permissible borrowing scope with an inaccurate condition.


**2. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status lies explicitly within Article 370 of the Indian Constitution, enabling the Centre to provide states facing socio-economic disadvantages with special financial assistance.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the primary mechanism used to allocate grants to SCS states until its discontinuation following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain a specific provision for categorizing states as SCS.  The granting of SCS is a policy decision made by the Centre based on socio-economic factors and recommendations from Finance Commissions.  Article 370 pertains to the special status of Jammu and Kashmir (now repealed), a different matter entirely.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the mechanism used for allocating grants to SCS states before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS classification. This is a significant shift in the Centre-state financial relationship.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, stemming from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, mandates the establishment of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in all states with significant tribal populations, ensuring uniform application across the country.
2.  The ADCs and ARCs established under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers limited to matters related to land revenue collection and forest management, excluding any judicial authority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule applies only to specific states (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram), not all states with significant tribal populations.  The establishment of ADCs and ARCs is not mandated uniformly nationwide.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule have extensive powers, including executive, legislative, and *judicial* powers within their defined areas. Their authority extends beyond land revenue and forest management to encompass a wide range of social, economic, and administrative matters.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs and Central Sector schemes became the sole mode of specific-purpose transfers from the Union to the States, eliminating other methods of intergovernmental financial transfers.
2.  The current framework of CSSs, based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, mandates a 90:10 Centre-State funding ratio for core schemes in all states, regardless of their geographical location or developmental needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSSs and Central Sector schemes became the *primary* mode of specific-purpose transfers after the 14th Finance Commission, other methods of intergovernmental financial transfers were not entirely eliminated.  Other forms of grants and revenue sharing continue to exist.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Centre-State funding ratio for core CSSs varies depending on the state's classification (e.g., North Eastern States and Himalayan States have a different ratio than other states).  A uniform 90:10 ratio is not applied universally.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the  National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi:**

1. Mission Karmayogi’s primary focus is on role-based training and capacity building, shifting away from rule-based approaches to enhance the adaptability and responsiveness of civil servants.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), established in 2021, is solely responsible for overseeing the implementation of all aspects of Mission Karmayogi, with no involvement from other government bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Mission Karmayogi’s core principle is a shift from rule-based to role-based training, focusing on developing competencies relevant to the changing needs of governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CBC plays a crucial role in Mission Karmayogi, it does not solely oversee all aspects.  Other ministries and departments are also involved in the implementation and execution of the program's various initiatives.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards administer areas exclusively housing military personnel, established through executive orders.
2.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cantonments do house military troops, they also comprise civilian populations.  A military *station*, in contrast, is exclusively for military personnel and established by executive order. Cantonments, on the other hand, have a more complex history, originating with the East India Company and possessing a blend of military and civilian inhabitants. Their administration is a subject of the Union government, reflecting their unique character.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, provides the legal framework for the administration of cantonments in India.  Its alignment with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies, highlights the dual nature of cantonments as both military establishments and areas with significant civilian populations requiring local governance. This act outlines the functions and powers of Cantonment Boards, ensuring civic services are provided to the residents.  The governance structure reflects the balance between military needs and the provision of essential civic amenities.


**2. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* established the right to a pollution-free environment as a fundamental right under Article 21.
2.  The Supreme Court ruling directly amended Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution to explicitly include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others*, while focused on the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, interpreted existing fundamental rights, particularly Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), to encompass the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.  The court didn't create a new right but broadened the interpretation of existing ones to include environmental protection.  This demonstrates the evolving judicial approach to environmental concerns within the existing constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court does not have the power to directly amend the Constitution.  Constitutional amendments require a specific procedure involving Parliament. The court's ruling expanded the scope of existing articles through interpretation, not formal amendment. The judgment highlights the judiciary's role in shaping environmental law and policy within the confines of the Constitution.


**3. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India for a term of five years or until they attain the age of seventy, whichever is earlier.
2. The NHRC's powers include summoning witnesses, examining them under oath, and requisitioning public records, similar to a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President appoints the Chairperson and members, their tenure is three years, not five, or until they reach seventy years of age, whichever comes first.  This shorter tenure is designed to ensure periodic renewal and prevent stagnation within the commission. Reappointment is possible, allowing for continuity of experience.

Statement 2 is correct. The NHRC possesses significant powers under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993. These powers are explicitly stated and enable the commission to effectively investigate human rights violations.  The ability to summon witnesses, examine them under oath, and access public records mirrors the powers of a civil court, reflecting the seriousness with which human rights violations are treated. This ensures the commission can conduct thorough investigations and hold perpetrators accountable.


**4. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) with members appointed for a five-year term, eligible for reappointment.
2.  Data principals have the right to obtain information about the processing of their personal data, but not the right to seek correction or erasure of that data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) members serve a two-year term, not five years, and are eligible for reappointment.  This shorter term allows for greater flexibility and responsiveness to evolving data protection needs.  The shorter tenure also ensures regular review and potential changes in membership to maintain expertise and prevent potential bias.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, grants data principals the right to obtain information about the processing of their data, and importantly, *also* the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data.  These rights are fundamental to the Act's aim of protecting individuals' data privacy.  The ability to correct inaccurate or outdated information and to have data erased when no longer necessary is crucial for upholding individual control over personal data.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2. The President's power to commute a death sentence extends only to cases where the death sentence is imposed for offences against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 does include court-martial sentences, it is not limited to them.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment extends to a broader range of cases, encompassing sentences imposed by both ordinary courts and court-martials.  This wide scope reflects the President's role as the highest authority in the nation's justice system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute death sentences regardless of the specific offense for which the death penalty was imposed. This power is not restricted to cases involving offenses under the Union's executive power. The President's authority in this matter is broad, encompassing all death sentences, reflecting the gravity of the death penalty and the need for a final check on its application.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2. The grounds for filing a curative petition include a violation of principles of natural justice or the judge's failure to disclose a connection with the subject matter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after all other legal avenues, including a review petition under Article 137 of the Constitution, have been exhausted.  This final recourse is intended to address exceptional circumstances where a serious miscarriage of justice may have occurred.  The sequence of remedies – review petition followed by a curative petition – reflects a hierarchical approach to judicial redressal.

Statement 2 is correct.  The grounds for filing a curative petition are stringent and limited to exceptional circumstances.  These include demonstrable violations of principles of natural justice, such as a judge's undisclosed conflict of interest.  The high threshold for filing a curative petition underscores the finality of Supreme Court judgments and the need to prevent frivolous challenges to decisions.  The court's power to grant curative relief stems from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice.



**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were launched in 2019 as a centrally sponsored scheme funded entirely by state governments.
2. The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs were launched in 2019, they are a *centrally sponsored* scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure. The funding primarily comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, indicating a national commitment to addressing these crimes.  The scheme's implementation is by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, further highlighting the central government's role.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of FTSCs is indeed to expedite the justice process for rape cases and those falling under the POCSO Act.  The establishment of these specialized courts aims to reduce the backlog of cases and ensure victims receive timely justice. The swift disposal of these sensitive cases is critical for preventing further trauma to victims and ensuring the timely prosecution of offenders.


**8. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part XVI of the Constitution.
2. The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints related to the violation of the rights of Scheduled Castes and recommend appropriate action to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It is established under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and not a part of the Constitution's original text or subsequent amendments.  While its functions are crucial for upholding constitutional guarantees, its legal basis is statutory, not constitutional.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCSC plays a crucial role in protecting the rights of Scheduled Castes.  Its powers include investigating complaints of atrocities and discrimination, summoning witnesses, and recommending appropriate action to the government.  These powers enable the commission to effectively address violations of Scheduled Castes' rights and promote their welfare.  The commission's actions are vital to ensuring that the constitutional safeguards for Scheduled Castes are effectively implemented.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and is based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
2. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act, 2005, is the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, indeed superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, aiming to provide a more comprehensive and effective mechanism for accessing information.  The act's foundation lies in the international recognition of the right to information as a human right, as articulated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international covenants.  This international context underscores the Act's significance in promoting transparency and accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act, 2005, is the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P), not the Ministry of Home Affairs. This placement reflects the Act's focus on government transparency and accountability across various ministries and departments.  The Ministry of Personnel's role emphasizes the importance of efficient and responsible governance.


**10. With reference to Preventive Detention in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The right to make an effective representation under Article 22(5) is applicable even if there is a delay in furnishing documents related to preventive detention.
2.  Laws permitting preventive detention include the National Security Act, 1980, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  A delay or failure in furnishing the documents relied upon for preventive detention *does* amount to a denial of the right to make an effective representation under Article 22(5).  This right is crucial for ensuring fairness and due process even in the context of preventive detention.  The timely provision of information is essential for enabling the detained individual to challenge the legality of their detention effectively.

Statement 2 is correct. The National Security Act, 1980, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, are indeed examples of laws that provide for preventive detention in India.  These laws allow for the detention of individuals without trial, but only under specific circumstances and subject to constitutional safeguards.  These laws highlight the delicate balance between national security and individual liberties.  The grounds for preventive detention are strictly defined, and the process involves scrutiny to ensure it adheres to constitutional provisions.


**11. With reference to Personality Rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Personality rights are explicitly defined in the Indian Constitution under the right to privacy.
2.  A defamation suit can be filed under the Indian Penal Code for derogatory representation of a deceased person's reputation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While personality rights are closely linked to the right to privacy, they are not explicitly defined in the Indian Constitution.  The right to privacy itself has been judicially recognized as a fundamental right, and personality rights are often considered a facet of this broader right.  The courts have evolved the concept of personality rights through case law, recognizing their importance in protecting an individual's identity and reputation.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Indian Penal Code allows for the filing of a defamation suit even after the death of the person whose reputation has been damaged.  This provision recognizes that the impact of defamation can extend beyond the lifetime of the individual, affecting their family and legacy.  This underscores the importance of protecting reputation, even posthumously.  The legal recourse available protects the memory and reputation of the deceased.


**12. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of states as Special Category States.
2.  The criteria for granting SCS are determined by the Finance Commission, and the funding is based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not explicitly mention or provide for the categorization of states as Special Category States.  The SCS is a policy-based classification adopted by the central government to provide additional financial assistance and other benefits to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  This policy-based nature makes it flexible but also subject to changes based on government policies.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  While the Finance Commission's recommendations have historically played a role in determining the financial assistance to SCS states, the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula is no longer the basis for funding. The criteria for granting SCS and the funding mechanisms have evolved over time, reflecting changing economic and political contexts.  The current approach is more nuanced and may involve various factors beyond a single formula.


**13. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was a direct outcome of the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  The Sixth Schedule applies uniformly across all states in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, which deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, originated from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.  This committee's work highlighted the need for special administrative arrangements to address the unique challenges faced by tribal communities in these regions.  The committee's findings provided the framework for the provisions included in the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule does not apply uniformly across all states in India.  Its application is limited to specific states in Northeast India, namely Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  This targeted approach recognizes the distinct needs and contexts of the tribal areas within these states.  The provisions of the Sixth Schedule are tailored to the specific circumstances of these regions, reflecting the constitutional recognition of the diversity of India's administrative landscape.


**14. With reference to the devolution of financial resources between the Union and States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The vertical devolution refers to the distribution of resources among different states, while the horizontal devolution refers to the share of states from the divisible pool.
2.  Grants-in-aid are provided to states by the Union government under Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The terms "vertical devolution" and "horizontal devolution" are reversed in the statement. Vertical devolution refers to the sharing of resources between the Union and the States, while horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of resources among the States themselves.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the different aspects of fiscal federalism in India.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution empowers the Union government to make grants-in-aid to states that are in need of special financial assistance.  These grants are crucial for ensuring that states can provide essential services to their citizens, particularly those facing financial constraints.  The provision of grants-in-aid reflects the spirit of cooperative federalism in India.


**15. With reference to the Emergency Provisions in the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  During a national emergency, the President can suspend fundamental rights under Article 359, including the right to life and personal liberty (Article 21).
2.  A resolution to approve or continue an emergency must be passed by a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 359 of the Constitution empowers the President to suspend the enforcement of certain fundamental rights during a national emergency.  While the scope of this suspension has been modified by amendments, it can include the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21, although with some limitations introduced after the 44th Amendment.  This power reflects the extraordinary circumstances that necessitate a national emergency.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A resolution to approve or continue a national emergency requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament – a majority of the total membership and at least two-thirds of the members present and voting.  This stringent requirement underscores the gravity of declaring and continuing an emergency, ensuring it is not undertaken lightly.  The special majority requirement reflects the need for broad parliamentary consensus in such exceptional circumstances.


**16. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law (Tenth Schedule), consider the following statements:**

1. The Tenth Schedule of the Constitution deals with disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on the grounds of defection.
2. The Speaker or the Chairman of the respective Houses has the final authority to decide on the disqualification of members under the Anti-Defection Law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Tenth Schedule, added to the Constitution through the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985, deals with the disqualification of members of Parliament and State Legislatures on the grounds of defection.  This schedule aims to prevent political instability caused by frequent shifts in party allegiance.  The provisions aim to promote stability in the government and ensure that elected representatives remain faithful to the party on whose ticket they were elected.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Speaker of the Lok Sabha or the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha (for Parliament) and the Speaker of the State Legislative Assembly or the Chairman of the State Legislative Council (for State Legislatures) have the final authority to decide on matters of disqualification under the anti-defection law.  While their decisions can be challenged in court, their initial determination holds significant weight in this process.  This arrangement reflects the need for a swift and efficient mechanism to address defections.



**1. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution of India.
2.  The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints relating to atrocities against Scheduled Castes and recommend appropriate action to the government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a statutory body, established under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and not a constitutional body enshrined in Part IX of the Constitution.  Part IX deals with Panchayats, and the NCSC's establishment is through legislation, not a constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC has broad powers under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, to inquire into complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.  This includes investigating allegations, summoning witnesses, examining documents, and recommending remedial action to the government. The Commission plays a crucial role in safeguarding the rights and interests of Scheduled Castes.  The government is bound to consider the recommendations, though not obligated to implement them.


**2. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to all Central Government services, including the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).
2. The Chairperson and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 65, whichever is earlier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is the primary body responsible for conducting the Civil Services Examination and other examinations for recruitment to various Central Government services.  The IAS is one of the premier services recruited through this process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Chairperson and members of the UPSC are indeed appointed by the President of India, their term is six years or until they attain the age of 62, not 65, whichever is earlier. This detail regarding the age limit is crucial for understanding the tenure of these crucial constitutional posts.


**3. With reference to the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CVC is an independent body that investigates allegations of corruption against Central Government employees.
2. The CVC has the power to prosecute Central Government employees found guilty of corruption.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CVC is an independent body established to combat corruption within the Central Government. It investigates allegations of corruption and recommends appropriate action to the concerned authorities.  Its independence is crucial for effective anti-corruption efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CVC does not have the power to prosecute.  It can only recommend action, including prosecution, to the relevant agencies.  The actual prosecution of Central Government employees rests with other investigative and judicial bodies.


**4. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and significantly broadened the scope of access to information for citizens.
2.  The RTI Act mandates that all Public Authorities must provide information requested by citizens within 30 days, without any exceptions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and substantially expanded the rights of citizens to access information held by public authorities.  It streamlined the process and provided stronger enforcement mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RTI Act aims for timely information disclosure, it does allow for exceptions under certain circumstances, such as those related to national security, or information that could harm individuals' privacy.  The 30-day timeframe is a guideline, and extensions are possible depending on the complexity of the request.


**5. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at promoting digital literacy in rural areas.
2. A key component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) through participatory Gram Sabhas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People’s Plan Campaign, focuses on participatory planning at the Panchayat level, not on digital literacy.  While digital tools might be used in the process, the core objective is to empower local communities in development planning.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves the preparation of PDPs through inclusive Gram Sabhas, ensuring local participation in identifying developmental needs and priorities.  This bottom-up approach is central to the campaign’s philosophy.


**6. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is an international organization headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, dedicated to promoting good governance practices in local bodies worldwide.
2. iCAL's primary function is to conduct independent audits of local government accounts and report its findings to the respective national governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is not an international organization headquartered in Geneva. It's a centre inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, India, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance but operating within the Indian context initially.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While iCAL will contribute to auditing local governance, its primary function is not solely limited to auditing accounts and reporting to national governments.  It aims to set standards, provide training, and promote best practices in local governance auditing.  Its scope extends beyond the purely financial aspects.


**7. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The concept of SCS was introduced in the Constitution of India through the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
2. States categorized as SCS receive special financial assistance from the central government based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The concept of SCS was not introduced through a constitutional amendment. The categorization of states as SCS is based on administrative decisions and not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  The criteria for SCS designation have evolved over time.

Statement 2 is correct. SCS states historically received special financial assistance from the central government, considering their unique needs and challenges. The Finance Commission's recommendations play a significant role in determining the allocation of funds to these states.  However, the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of the SCS category.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India.
2. The Governor of the respective state has the power to dissolve an autonomous district council under the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, Article 244(2), establishes autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India to safeguard the interests of tribal communities. These councils have significant administrative and legislative powers within their respective areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Governor of the respective state, under the Sixth Schedule, has the power to dissolve an autonomous district council if it fails to perform its functions properly or if there is a breakdown of law and order within the council's jurisdiction.  This power is a safeguard to ensure the councils function effectively.


**9. With reference to Mercy Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can reject a mercy petition only after consulting with the Supreme Court of India.
2. A mercy petition can be filed only after all appeals have been exhausted in the ordinary judicial process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While consultation with the Supreme Court is often a practice, it is not mandatory for the President to consult the Supreme Court before rejecting a mercy petition. The President has the sole discretion in such matters.

Statement 2 is correct.  A mercy petition is a last resort, filed only after all legal avenues for appeal in the regular judicial process have been exhausted. It's a plea for clemency, seeking a reduction or commutation of the sentence.


**10. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed in any High Court of India.
2. The Supreme Court of India has the power to dismiss a curative petition without assigning any reasons.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition can only be filed in the Supreme Court of India. It is the final legal recourse available after all other remedies, including review petitions, have been exhausted.

Statement 2 is correct.  While transparency is generally preferred in judicial proceedings, the Supreme Court has the power to dismiss a curative petition without providing detailed reasons.  This is due to the extraordinary nature of curative petitions and the need to maintain the finality of judicial decisions.


**11. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established primarily to deal with cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The FTSCs are funded entirely by the respective State Governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A significant portion of FTSCs' workload is dedicated to cases under the POCSO Act. They were established to expedite the disposal of such sensitive cases, ensuring speedy justice for victims.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, primarily funded by the central government through the Nirbhaya Fund. State governments may contribute, but the major funding source is the central government.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, and not a constitutional body.  While it plays a crucial role in upholding human rights, its existence is based on legislation, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's recommendations are not legally binding.  While its reports and recommendations carry significant weight and influence, government agencies are not legally obligated to comply. The NHRC relies on moral suasion and public pressure to ensure its recommendations are acted upon.


**13. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the FCRA, all NGOs receiving foreign funds must open a separate FCRA account in a designated bank.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amended FCRA mandates that all NGOs receiving foreign funds must maintain a separate FCRA account in a designated bank branch. This ensures transparency and facilitates monitoring of the use of foreign funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The amended FCRA restricts the use of foreign funds for administrative expenses to a maximum of 20%, not 50%, reflecting a stricter approach to the utilization of foreign contributions.  This limit aims to ensure the funds are primarily used for the stated purposes.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DGPS is appointed by the central government, not the President of India.  This reflects the administrative structure of the postal services under the executive branch.


**15. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are primarily aimed at providing IT-enabled services to urban populations.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a private sector company that manages and oversees the CSC scheme.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are designed to bridge the digital divide and provide IT-enabled services primarily to rural areas and underserved populations.  They aim to extend government and private sector services to the last mile.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSC SPV is a public sector company set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956. It is not a private sector entity.  It plays a crucial role in coordinating and managing the CSC network.


**16. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI is published annually by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
2.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 reflects concerns about the safety of journalists and freedom of expression in the country.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI is published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based NGO, not by UNESCO.  UNESCO does work on freedom of expression, but it's not the publisher of this specific index.

Statement 2 is correct. India's relatively low ranking in the WPFI 2024 reflects concerns about press freedom, including instances of violence against journalists, restrictions on reporting, and challenges to freedom of expression.  The ranking highlights the need for greater protection for journalists and the promotion of a free and independent media.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Cantonment Boards in India:**

1.  The Cantonment Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.
2.  Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for managing military installations and are under the direct administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Cantonment Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments in India.  It's crucial to note that this Act works in conjunction with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with local self-governance.  The alignment is not a direct subordination but a framework for the functioning of Cantonment Boards within the broader context of local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While cantonments house military troops, Cantonment Boards have responsibilities extending beyond purely military installations. They perform civic duties for both military and civilian populations residing within the cantonment area, such as providing public health services, water supply, and primary education. The Ministry of Defence has administrative control, but the Boards' functions are significantly broader than just military management. The statement oversimplifies the role and responsibilities of Cantonment Boards.  They are local self-governing bodies with a distinct mandate.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's judgment on environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's recent judgment, relating to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard, established a new fundamental right to a pollution-free environment under Article 21.
2.  The judgment invoked Articles 14 and 21 to recognize the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change, expanding the scope of existing fundamental rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court did not establish a *new* fundamental right to a pollution-free environment. The judgment built upon the existing right to life (Article 21), which has been interpreted to include the right to a healthy environment in previous cases.  The court expanded the interpretation of Article 21 in the context of climate change impacts, but it didn't create a separate, distinct fundamental right. The focus was on the application of existing rights to a novel situation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court’s judgment explicitly used Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) as the basis for recognizing the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.  This is a significant development, broadening the scope of these fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns and climate justice.  The court demonstrated its power of judicial review to adapt constitutional principles to contemporary challenges.


**3. With reference to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  In FPTP systems, a party can win more seats than its share of the total votes cast, while in PR systems, seat allocation is strictly proportional to vote share.
2.  FPTP systems tend to produce stable governments, whereas PR systems often lead to coalition governments due to fragmented legislatures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  FPTP systems, by their nature, focus on winning individual constituencies. A party might win a significant number of seats even if it doesn't secure a majority of the overall votes.  This is because the winner-takes-all approach doesn't directly translate vote percentages into seat allocations. In contrast, PR systems aim for a closer correspondence between vote share and seat allocation, though perfect proportionality is rarely achieved.

Statement 2 is also correct. FPTP systems often result in one party or a clear majority coalition winning, leading to greater government stability.  PR systems, especially those with lower electoral thresholds, frequently produce multi-party legislatures where no single party holds a majority. This necessitates coalition governments, which can be less stable due to potential internal disagreements and power-sharing complexities.  The instability is a consequence of the system's design, aiming for broader representation.


**4. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations on the devolution of taxes between the Union and states are binding on the Central Government.
2.  The 15th Finance Commission's horizontal devolution formula prioritized income distance as the most significant criterion for allocating funds among states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission's recommendations carry immense weight and are generally followed, they are not legally binding on the Central Government.  The government can, in principle, deviate from the recommendations, although such deviations are rare and often met with significant political and economic consequences.  The recommendations are persuasive but not legally enforceable.

Statement 2 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission did indeed prioritize income distance as the most significant criterion (45% weightage) in its horizontal devolution formula. This aimed to address regional disparities and ensure a more equitable distribution of resources among states.  Other factors like area, population, and demographic performance were also considered, but income distance held the highest weight.


**5. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provision for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the Special Category Status scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain any explicit provision for granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states.  The SCS was a policy decision based on various factors, including socio-economic conditions and geographical disadvantages.  It was a flexible mechanism, not a rigid constitutional framework.  The absence of a constitutional basis highlights the political nature of the SCS designation.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of the SCS scheme, arguing that it created unwarranted fiscal imbalances and lacked transparency.  The commission proposed a new system of grants based on more objective criteria, aiming for a more equitable distribution of funds among states.  This effectively ended the practice of granting SCS.


**6. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
2.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected Areas but not Restricted Areas in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a significant portion of Arunachal Pradesh is designated as a Protected Area, it is not entirely classified as such. The statement presents an oversimplification of the geographical categorization. Parts of other states, such as Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand, are also designated as Protected Areas.  The classification is not uniform across the entire state.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Foreigners generally require special permits to enter both Protected and Restricted Areas in India.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs access to both categories, recognizing the sensitive nature of these areas for security and environmental reasons.  The level of scrutiny might vary depending on the area's sensitivity, but permits are typically required for both.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in all states with scheduled tribes.
2.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers in areas such as land revenue collection and forest management but not judicial powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's provisions for establishing Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) are limited to specific states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It does not extend to all states with scheduled tribes.  The application is geographically restricted to these four northeastern states, reflecting their unique historical and administrative contexts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule do possess executive and legislative powers, including those related to land revenue collection and forest management. Importantly, they also have certain judicial powers.  This broad authority is designed to empower these councils in managing local affairs and preserving tribal traditions. The statement incorrectly limits their powers, neglecting the judicial aspects of their authority.


**8. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states without the President's recommendation.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state requires a simple majority in both houses of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 3 of the Indian Constitution explicitly states that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament *on the recommendation of the President*.  This ensures that the executive branch plays a crucial role in such significant constitutional changes, reflecting the federal nature of the Indian polity.  The President's recommendation is a mandatory requirement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a bill for the formation of a new state needs to be passed by both houses of Parliament, it does not require a simple majority.  It requires a special majority, meaning a majority of the total membership of the House and a majority of at least two-thirds of the members present and voting.  This reflects the significance of such constitutional amendments.


**9. With reference to the regulation of Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, provides a comprehensive regulatory framework for OTT platforms.
2.  The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is primarily responsible for regulating the content of OTT platforms in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, does *not* provide a comprehensive regulatory framework for OTT platforms.  The regulation of OTT platforms is a complex issue, and currently, there is no single, all-encompassing law governing them.  Various ministries and regulatory bodies have a role, leading to a fragmented regulatory landscape. The statement inaccurately attributes a specific regulatory role to the Act.

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. While the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting plays a significant role in regulating the content of OTT platforms (through self-regulatory bodies and guidelines), it is not solely responsible.  Other ministries and agencies also have overlapping jurisdiction, depending on the specific aspects of OTT platform operations. This makes the statement an oversimplification of a complex regulatory structure.  The regulatory landscape for OTT platforms is multifaceted and evolving.


**10. With reference to internet shutdowns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, require judicial review of all internet shutdown orders before implementation.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* upheld the legality of indefinite internet shutdowns under the 2017 Rules.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017,  *do not* mandate judicial review *before* the implementation of internet shutdown orders.  The rules provide for a review committee to examine the orders *after* they are issued, but there's no requirement for pre-emptive judicial scrutiny.  This has been a point of contention regarding the balance between national security and fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's judgment in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* explicitly *rejected* the legality of indefinite internet shutdowns. The court held that such shutdowns must be for a limited duration and proportionate to the threat to public order.  The judgment emphasized the importance of balancing national security concerns with the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression.  The statement misrepresents the court's findings.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards primarily function as local self-government bodies administering areas exclusively housing military personnel.
2.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cantonments do house military troops, they also comprise civilian populations.  A military station, in contrast, is exclusively for military personnel. Cantonment Boards administer areas with a mix of military and civilian inhabitants.  The definition in the provided text clearly distinguishes between a cantonment and a military station.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of cantonments in India. Its provisions are in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with local self-government.  The Act outlines the powers and functions of Cantonment Boards, including civic responsibilities.  Therefore, the statement accurately reflects the legal framework governing these boards.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's judgment on environmental rights:**

1. The Supreme Court's recent judgment, in the case concerning the Great Indian Bustard, explicitly recognized the right to a pollution-free environment under Article 21.
2.  The judgment expanded the scope of Article 14 by including the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a facet of equal protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Supreme Court judgment mentioned did indeed link the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to existing fundamental rights.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the connection to Article 21 (right to life), which the Court interpreted to encompass the right to a healthy environment, free from the detrimental impacts of climate change.  This interpretation extends the scope of the right to life beyond mere physical survival.

Statement 2 is also correct because the judgment implicitly broadened the understanding of Article 14 (right to equality). By recognizing the right to be free from climate change's adverse effects, the court implicitly acknowledges that the unequal impact of climate change on different groups violates the principle of equality before the law.  The judgment, thus, extended the concept of equality to encompass environmental justice.


**3. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 45% share of divisible pool revenue for states, primarily based on their population size.
2.  Grants-in-aid provided by the central government to states are explicitly mentioned in Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, population was only one of several criteria used to determine the distribution. Other factors, like income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts, also played significant roles, each with its specific weight in the formula.  The statement incorrectly emphasizes population as the primary factor.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution explicitly empowers the central government to provide grants-in-aid to states. These grants are intended to address the states' financial needs and help bridge the gap between their revenue and expenditure. The article provides the constitutional basis for this crucial aspect of India's fiscal federalism.


**4.  With respect to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly laid down in the Constitution itself.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS, replacing it with a different funding mechanism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain a specific provision for categorizing states as having Special Category Status. While the provision of special assistance to certain states is evident through various articles (like Articles 371A-J) which provide special provisions, there is no formal constitutional categorization of SCS.  The grants were historically based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula but this was not a constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission did indeed recommend the discontinuation of the Special Category Status classification.  The rationale behind this was to create a more equitable distribution of funds, avoiding the potential for bias towards certain states.  The new funding mechanism aimed to provide greater transparency and accountability, assessing the needs of states based on various socio-economic factors rather than the previously used classifications.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the President to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in specified states.
2.  The ADCs under the Sixth Schedule have the power to legislate on matters like land revenue collection but lack the authority to impose taxes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the Governor (not the President) of the concerned states to establish ADCs and ARCs in the designated areas.  This is a crucial aspect of the Sixth Schedule's provisions for granting autonomy to tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. The creation of these councils aims at promoting self-governance and protecting the rights of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs under the Sixth Schedule possess the power to not only collect land revenue but also impose taxes. This is an essential part of their autonomy, enabling them to generate revenue for local development and administration.  The statement misrepresents the extent of their financial powers.


**6. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Parliament can form a new state by uniting parts of existing states only with the prior consent of the state legislatures involved.
2. The President's recommendation is required before a bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in either House of Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Parliament has the power to form new states by separating territory from any state, uniting two or more states, uniting parts of states, and uniting any territory to a part of any state, it does *not* require the prior consent of the state legislatures involved.  The process is primarily governed by Article 3 of the Constitution, and parliamentary approval is sufficient.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 clearly states that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in either House of Parliament with the President's recommendation. This ensures that the executive branch is involved in this significant constitutional process, reflecting the checks and balances within the system.


**7. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CBI is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  The selection panel for the CBI Director comprises the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is *not* a constitutional body. It is a statutory body established under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Although it plays a crucial role in law enforcement and investigation, it does not derive its authority directly from the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The selection of the CBI Director involves a crucial three-member committee.  This committee consists of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India.  This process is designed to ensure the appointment of an independent and impartial director, free from political influence.


**8. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI has the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for violations of data protection laws but cannot direct them to take remedial measures.
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions can be made to the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPBI *does* have the power to both impose penalties and direct data fiduciaries to take necessary measures in case of data breaches or other violations. This reflects its role in enforcing data protection regulations and ensuring compliance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court of India.  This is specified in the relevant legislation governing the DPBI's functioning and appeals process.  The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is not directly involved in this specific type of appeal.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to all states and union territories of India, including tribal areas.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the state government in consultation with the High Court and functions as a court of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class, settling both civil and criminal disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, explicitly exempts the states of Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas from its purview.  Therefore, the jurisdiction of Gram Nyayalayas does not extend to all states and union territories.

Statement 2 is correct. The Nyayadhikari is indeed appointed by the state government in consultation with the High Court and the Gram Nyayalaya is deemed to be a Court of Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.  Their function is to settle both civil and criminal disputes at the village level.  The Act aims to provide accessible and efficient dispute resolution mechanisms at the grassroots level.  This reflects a commitment to providing justice closer to the people, especially in rural areas, and aligning with the principles of access to justice and efficient dispute resolution.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court but not necessarily interfering with the administration of justice.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively, and is defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Criminal contempt explicitly includes actions that interfere with or obstruct the administration of justice.  It's not limited to just scandalizing or lowering the authority of a court.  The definition encompasses a broader range of actions that undermine the judicial process.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a detailed framework for defining and dealing with contempt of court cases.  This power is crucial for upholding the authority and integrity of the judiciary and ensuring the smooth functioning of the court system.  The Act balances the need to protect the judiciary from unwarranted attacks with the fundamental rights of individuals to freedom of speech and expression.


**3. With reference to Mercy Petitions and the President's powers, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons extends to death sentences but not to sentences imposed by state-level courts for offenses under state laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is imposed for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends; this is not limited to court-martial sentences.  The scope is broader than just court-martial cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's power under Article 72 extends to death sentences regardless of whether the sentence was imposed by a state-level court or a Union court.  The power is not restricted based on the level of the court or the nature of the law under which the sentence was imposed.  The President's role in this context is to provide a final avenue for clemency, acting as a check on the judicial system and providing a mechanism for considering extraordinary circumstances.


**4. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed, and it primarily addresses procedural irregularities, such as violations of natural justice, rather than substantive errors in the judgment.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice and is established by the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is the last resort, available only after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed. While it can address substantive errors, the focus is often on procedural flaws like violations of natural justice or a judge's undisclosed connection to the case. This reflects a hierarchical approach to judicial remedies, where extraordinary remedies like curative petitions are reserved for exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The power to hear curative petitions is derived from Article 142, which allows the Supreme Court to do complete justice.  The case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr. shaped the procedure and parameters for curative petitions, establishing it as a distinct and final remedy within the Indian judicial system.  This emphasizes the Supreme Court's role as the ultimate guarantor of justice and its power to correct even the most serious errors.


**5. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are established under a state-sponsored scheme primarily funded by the states themselves, aiming to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. The implementation of FTSCs is overseen by the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, and their establishment is meant to address the backlog of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored, and are funded by the central government from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The funding source indicates a national commitment to addressing these specific types of crimes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, oversees the implementation of FTSCs.  The objective of establishing FTSCs is to ensure swift disposal of rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act, aiming to reduce the backlog and provide timely justice to victims.  This reflects a policy response to the urgent need for quicker resolution of serious crimes against women and children.


**6. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is based on the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act, and their administration falls under the purview of the state governments.
2.  The first cantonment in India, Barrackpore, was established by the East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, and currently, there are over 70 cantonments in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, but this Act is in accordance with the 74th, not the 73rd, Constitutional Amendment Act.  Furthermore, the administration of cantonments falls under the Union Government, not the state governments, as it's listed under Entry 3 of the Union List.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Barrackpore was indeed the first cantonment, established in 1765 (not 1757), and established by the East India Company after the Battle of Plassey, there are currently 61 cantonments in India, not over 70.  The number is significantly lower than stated.


**7. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's recent judgment linking the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 and 21 was made in the case of M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others, concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment expands the scope of fundamental rights, specifically Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), by including the right to a healthy environment as an essential component of these rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court's judgment linking the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 and 21 was indeed delivered in the case of M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others.  This case highlighted the interconnectedness of environmental protection and fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is also correct. The judgment significantly broadened the interpretation of Articles 14 and 21, incorporating the right to a healthy environment as an intrinsic part of the right to equality and the right to life.  This represents a judicial recognition of the importance of environmental protection for human well-being and sets a precedent for future cases concerning environmental rights.  The court’s interpretation reflects a progressive view of fundamental rights, acknowledging that these rights are not static but evolve with societal needs and understanding.


**8. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’, aims to ensure the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26 through the active involvement of elected representatives, frontline workers, and community-based organizations but excludes the participation of youth and elderly.
2.  A key component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves structured Gram Sabhas, Ward Sabhas, and Mahila Sabhas at all three tiers of Panchayats to identify thematic developmental gaps based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) and to present these in the Gram Sabhas, with the approved GPDP published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly encourages the inclusive participation of youth and elderly (over 75 years) in the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).  The aim is to ensure broad-based participation and representation in the planning process.

Statement 2 is correct.  Structured Gram Sabhas, Ward Sabhas, and Mahila Sabhas are indeed key components of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.  The process involves identifying thematic developmental gaps using the PDI and presenting these findings in Gram Sabhas. The approved GPDP is then published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal, promoting transparency and accountability. This participatory approach aims to empower local communities and ensure that development plans are aligned with their needs and priorities.  The use of the PDI provides a standardized framework for assessing development progress and identifying areas needing attention.


**9. With reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, amended in 2015, 2019, and 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards only if the arbitration agreement itself was obtained through fraud or corruption.
2.  The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, was established to promote domestic arbitration, while the Indian Council of Arbitration is a global body facilitating international commercial arbitration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards if the arbitration agreement, contracts, or the award itself were obtained through fraud or corruption. The scope is broader than just the arbitration agreement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The New Delhi International Arbitration Centre Act, 2019, facilitates *institutional* arbitration, aiming to improve the efficiency and reputation of arbitration in India.  The Indian Council of Arbitration is a *domestic* body, not a global one, primarily focused on domestic commercial arbitration.  The statement mischaracterizes the roles and focuses of these organizations.


**10. With reference to Mission Karmayogi and its guiding principles, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building, adopting a competency-driven approach, but does not adhere to any specific learning mandate like the 70-20-10 principle.
2. The Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT)-Karmayogi platform is designed to monitor and evaluate the performance of only individual learners and content providers, excluding supervisors and creators.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi explicitly adopts the 70-20-10 learning mandate, emphasizing that 70% of learning comes from on-the-job experience, 20% from interaction with others, and 10% from formal training.  The statement omits a key component of the Mission's approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The iGOT-Karmayogi platform monitors and evaluates the performance of all users, including individual learners, supervisors, content providers, and creators.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of performance monitoring.  The comprehensive evaluation system aims to ensure the quality and effectiveness of the training programs and the platform itself.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  It was launched in 2023 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2026-27, focusing on accelerating people's participation.
2.  The Abhiyan's implementation involves all three tiers of Panchayats, but excludes the active participation of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and other community-based organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People's Plan Campaign (PPC), was launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not in 2023.  While it does prepare PDPs, the timeframe mentioned is also incorrect; the given timeframe is for 2025-26, not 2026-27. The focus on accelerating people's participation is accurate.  The significant error in the launch year and the planning period makes this statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Abhiyan explicitly includes the active involvement of elected representatives, government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders in its implementation across all three tiers of Panchayats.  The exclusion of SHGs and other CBOs is factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the second such center in the country, aiming to establish national standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2.  The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, conducts online audits of panchayat accounts to ensure accountability but has not received any international recognition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is the *first* such center in India, not the second.  Its aim is to set *global*, not national, standards for auditing local governance bodies. The claim of a second center and the incorrect specification of the standard-setting scope render the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AuditOnline application has indeed been awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Geneva, thus contradicting the statement's claim of no international recognition.


**3. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on the training and development of senior bureaucrats within the Indian Civil Service.
2.  The 70-20-10 Mandate, a core principle of Mission Karmayogi, allocates 70% of learning to on-the-job experiences, 20% to peer learning, and 10% to formal classroom training.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is far broader than just senior bureaucrats; it encompasses *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments of the Union Government.  The statement's limited scope is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct regarding the allocation of learning time under the 70-20-10 mandate. However, the description of the 10% component as "formal classroom training" is a slight oversimplification; while planned training is included, it is not solely limited to traditional classroom methods. The statement is substantially correct but not perfectly precise.


**4. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions (MoPPG&P) has recently increased the timeline for grievance redressal to 30 days from the previous 21 days.
2.  The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is used to rank Ministries/Departments on a quarterly basis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MoPPG&P has actually *reduced* the timeline for effective grievance redressal to 21 days from the previous 30 days, not increased it. This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GRAI is issued *monthly*, not quarterly, for ranking Ministries/Departments.  The incorrect frequency makes this statement false.


**5. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a report from a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, published in 2010.
2.  For core schemes in the eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states, the Centre's contribution is 80%, while the state's contribution is 20%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report, not a 2010 report. The incorrect year makes the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Centre's contribution for core schemes in the specified states is 90%, not 80%, while the state's contribution is 10%. The incorrect percentage figures make the statement false.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Sevottam model:**

1. The Sevottam model is a framework for improving the quality of public service delivery, consisting of four modules.
2.  One of the modules of the Sevottam model is focused on strengthening the internal grievance redressal mechanisms within government organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sevottam model comprises *three*, not four, modules.  The incorrect number of modules makes the statement false.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of the three modules of the Sevottam model focuses on the Grievance Redressal Mechanism, which includes strengthening internal grievance redressal mechanisms within government organizations.


**7. With reference to the iGOT-Karmayogi platform, consider the following statements:**

1. The iGOT-Karmayogi platform is a comprehensive online portal designed exclusively for the training and development of government officials at the state level.
2. Performance monitoring on the iGOT-Karmayogi platform includes evaluation of individual learners, supervisors, content providers, and creators, but excludes the evaluation of the platform itself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The iGOT-Karmayogi platform is designed for the capacity building of government officials at the *union* level, not exclusively at the state level.  The incorrect level of government makes the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the platform does monitor and evaluate individual learners, supervisors, content providers, and creators, the performance of the platform itself is also monitored and evaluated using key performance indicators. The exclusion of platform evaluation is factually wrong.


**8. With reference to the People’s Plan Campaign (PPC) or Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The PPC utilizes a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopting a “Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach.”
2. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is a single-domain index used to assess the overall development of panchayats, focusing primarily on financial performance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PPC does indeed employ a thematic approach based on localized SDGs, using a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach" to ensure comprehensive participation and development planning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PDI is a *multi-domain* and *multi-sectoral* index, not a single-domain one.  It assesses holistic development, not just financial performance. The description of the PDI's scope is inaccurate.


**9. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882, to oversee the implementation of the CSC scheme.
2.  CSCs primarily serve urban citizens, providing a range of government and private sector services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSC SPV was set up under the Companies Act, 1956, not the Indian Trusts Act, 1882. The incorrect act makes the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSCs primarily serve *rural* citizens, not urban ones, providing an integrated delivery of government, private, and social sector services. The incorrect target population makes the statement false.


**10. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors, acting as a center of excellence for capacity building and knowledge sharing.
2. iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of local governance bodies, replacing existing audit mechanisms within individual states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. iCAL functions as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors, enhancing capacity building and knowledge sharing in the field of local governance auditing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL does not replace existing audit mechanisms; it aims to enhance their effectiveness and independence, setting global standards and serving as a center of excellence.  The statement misrepresents iCAL's role.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to solely focus on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26, excluding any other developmental activities.
2.  The campaign's implementation involves only elected representatives at the Gram Panchayat level, excluding other stakeholders like government frontline workers and Community-Based Organizations (CBOs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's primary focus is on preparing PDPs for 2025-26, it is not limited to this single activity.  The broader aim is to accelerate people's participation in the development planning process, encompassing various developmental aspects beyond just PDP preparation for a specific year. The campaign uses a thematic approach based on localized SDGs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's implementation is not restricted to only elected representatives at the Gram Panchayat level.  It explicitly involves active participation from all three tiers of Panchayats, along with government frontline workers, CBOs like SHGs, and other key stakeholders to ensure inclusivity and effective plan formulation.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the second such center in the country, aiming to enhance the capacity of local government auditors.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India's mandate for auditing local bodies is derived from the Panchayati Raj Act, 1992, which outlines the responsibilities of CAG in relation to local self-governance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is explicitly stated to be the *first* such center in the country.  The statement incorrectly claims it's the second.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, not the Panchayati Raj Act, 1992. While the Panchayati Raj Act deals with local self-governance, it doesn't define the CAG's auditing role. The 1971 Act grants the CAG the authority to audit the accounts of all three levels of PRIs/ULBs.


**3. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar, while providing proof of address and identity for Indian residents, also serves as definitive proof of citizenship and domicile.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act mandated that Aadhaar would be compulsory for all individuals to open bank accounts, regardless of their participation in social welfare schemes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of address and identity but *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile.  These are distinct legal concepts requiring separate documentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment explicitly stated that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but *not* compulsory for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  The court emphasized the protection of individual rights in this matter.


**4.  Consider the following statements regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1. CSSs are exclusively funded by the central government, with no financial contribution required from the states.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission (2015).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, with a shared funding arrangement. The statement incorrectly asserts sole central funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The current framework of CSSs is based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the Fourteenth Finance Commission.  The Finance Commission deals with fiscal matters at a broader level, while the Sub-Group focused specifically on CSS rationalization.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute the sentence of a person convicted of any offense, but this power does not extend to death sentences.
2. The President's power under Article 72 extends only to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for offenses against laws related to matters under the executive power of the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to commute death sentences. The statement incorrectly limits the President's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's power under Article 72 does extend to cases involving court-martials and offenses under Union executive power, it is not limited to these cases only. It also includes cases where a sentence of death is imposed by a regular court for any offense, even those under state laws.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the first constitutional remedy available to a person whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, which allows it to do complete justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last*, not the first, resort available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court. It is an extraordinary remedy.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions is rooted in its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice, ensuring no miscarriage of justice occurs. This power allows the court to address exceptional circumstances that may have been overlooked in earlier proceedings.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs):**

1. FTSCs are a state-sponsored scheme aimed at ensuring the speedy disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.
2.  The funding for FTSCs is entirely borne by the respective state governments, without any central government contribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored* scheme, launched in 2019 and extended up to 2026, to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, which is managed by the central government.  This means that the central government bears the expenditure, not solely the state governments.


**8. With reference to plea bargaining under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. Plea bargaining under BNSS is applicable to all offenses, irrespective of the nature of the crime or the sentence involved.
2. Under BNSS, the application for plea bargaining must be made within 30 days from the date of the commencement of the trial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Plea bargaining under BNSS, 2023, is *not* applicable to all offenses. It's limited to offenses punishable by up to seven years of imprisonment, with certain exclusions, such as crimes against women, children, and socio-economic offenses.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The application for plea bargaining under BNSS must be made within 30 days from the date of framing of the charge, not from the commencement of the trial.  The timeframe begins after the formal charges are presented, not at the very start of the trial proceedings.


**9. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act prohibits only members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes from committing offenses against other members of the same communities.
2. The Act provides for punishment only for direct acts of violence against members of SCs/STs, excluding instances of neglect of duty by public servants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act prohibits *anyone*, regardless of their caste or tribe, from committing offenses against members of SCs/STs. The statement incorrectly restricts the prohibition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly provides for punishment for the neglect of duties under the Act by public servants who are *not* members of SCs/STs. The statement wrongly limits the scope of punishment.


**10. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, mandates the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas in every village across India, with no exemptions.
2. Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but they are bound by the principles of natural justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, exempts certain states like Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas from the mandatory establishment of Gram Nyayalayas.  The statement incorrectly claims universal applicability.

Statement 2 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are not strictly bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, allowing for a more flexible approach to evidence, but they must adhere to the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and due process.


**11. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1. Civil contempt refers to the willful disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court, but it does not encompass the willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Civil contempt *does* include the willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.  The statement incorrectly excludes this crucial aspect of civil contempt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Criminal contempt includes the publication of matters that *both* scandalize or lower the authority of a court *and* prejudice or interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of criminal contempt.


**12. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2020, consider the following statements:**

1.  The FCRA allows NGOs to receive foreign funds without any prior permission, provided they submit an annual report detailing the usage of funds.
2.  Under the amended FCRA, NGOs can utilize up to 50% of the foreign contribution received for administrative expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The amended FCRA mandates *prior* permission to receive foreign funds through registration with mandatory Aadhaar submission of every office-bearer of NGOs.  The statement incorrectly suggests that prior permission is not required.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Under the amended FCRA, NGOs can utilize a maximum of 20% (not 50%) of the foreign contribution received for administrative expenses. The statement incorrectly states a higher percentage.


**13. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Post Office Act, 2023, repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.
2. The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) appointed under the 2023 Act will not have the authority to make regulations concerning charges for postal services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, indeed repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1898.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DGPS appointed under the 2023 Act *does* have the power to make regulations on various matters, including charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps. The statement incorrectly denies this authority.

1.  Article 44 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to implement a Uniform Civil Code throughout the territory of India by a specific deadline.
2.  Currently, all religious communities in India follow a uniform personal law governing matters like marriage, divorce, and inheritance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 44 of the Constitution directs the state to *endeavor* to secure for the citizens a uniform civil code but does *not* mandate a specific deadline for its implementation. The statement incorrectly implies a mandatory deadline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Currently, India operates under a diverse system of personal laws, with each religious community largely adhering to its own set of laws governing personal matters.  The statement incorrectly asserts uniform personal laws across all communities.


**15. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act allows for the alteration of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
2. The Act prohibits the filing of any new suits challenging the ownership of places of worship, irrespective of the date of the dispute's origin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act declares that the religious character of a place of worship will *continue* to be the same as it was on August 15, 1947; it does *not* allow for alterations. The statement misrepresents the Act's core provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act aims to maintain the status quo ante of places of worship as of August 15, 1947, it does not completely prohibit *all* new suits challenging ownership; rather,  the Supreme Court has issued orders concerning the registration of new suits.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate interpretation of the Act's implications.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayats, excluding Block and District Panchayats, to ensure granular-level planning and implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," aims to improve people's participation in PDP preparation.  The initiative emphasizes inclusive participation at all three tiers of Panchayats—Gram, Block, and District—involving elected representatives, government officials, and community organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan's scope is not limited to Gram Panchayats. It actively involves all three levels of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District) in preparing respective development plans (GPDP, Block PDP, and District PDP). The structured Ward Sabha/Mahila Sabha/Gram Sabha/Block Sabha/District Sabha are held to facilitate this process.  The campaign's holistic approach ensures planning and implementation at various administrative levels, reflecting a comprehensive strategy for rural development.  The focus on all three tiers ensures a coordinated and integrated approach to development.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly audits the accounts of all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), bypassing any intermediary agencies.
2.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is mandated to replace the existing auditing mechanisms for local bodies across India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, the audit isn't conducted directly by the CAG.  It is typically carried out through intermediary agencies like the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states. These agencies work under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG. The CAG exercises control and supervision but doesn't directly conduct the audits at the ground level for all PRIs/ULBs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies and serve as a center of excellence for capacity building.  However, it is not intended to replace the existing auditing mechanisms.  Instead, it complements them by improving the effectiveness and independence of local government auditors, leading to better financial performance assessment and service delivery. It focuses on enhancing the existing system, not replacing it entirely.


**3. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of states as Special Category States.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state has been granted SCS since then.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does not contain any provision for categorizing states as Special Category States.  The SCS was a classification introduced based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission (1969) to assist states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  This was an administrative classification, not a constitutional one.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS.  Since then, no state has been granted this status.  While special funding mechanisms continue for some states (like Northeastern and Himalayan states), these are based on other criteria and recommendations, not the SCS classification.  The shift away from SCS reflects a change in the approach to addressing regional disparities.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented by state governments.
2.  All transfers to states for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State, regardless of the funding pattern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The funding pattern varies depending on the scheme and the state (e.g., 90:10 for some Northeastern and Himalayan states, 60:40 for others).  The central government doesn't solely fund these schemes.  The joint funding reflects a collaborative approach to development initiatives.

Statement 2 is correct.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, all transfers to states for CSSs are channeled through the Consolidated Fund of the State. This ensures transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds at the state level.  This centralized routing mechanism simplifies the process of fund allocation and tracking.


**5. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on training and capacity building for senior-level bureaucrats in the Indian Civil Services.
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is broader than just senior bureaucrats. It aims to create a professional, well-trained civil service, encompassing all civil servants (including contractual employees) across various ministries and departments of the Union Government.  The program is designed to enhance the capabilities of the entire civil service, not just a select group.

Statement 2 is correct. A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is the shift from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building. This emphasizes developing competencies relevant to specific roles and responsibilities rather than focusing solely on adherence to rules and regulations. This modern approach to training makes the civil service more effective and adaptable.


**6. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole designated agency responsible for handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  CPGRAMS is an online platform exclusively for lodging grievances related to corruption within government agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While DARPG (under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions) is a key agency handling grievances, it is not the sole designated agency at the Union Government level. The Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat also plays a significant role in grievance redressal.  The division of responsibilities ensures a comprehensive approach to handling citizen concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is a broader platform for lodging grievances related to various aspects of service delivery, not exclusively corruption.  While corruption complaints can be filed, the platform covers a wider range of citizen concerns, providing a centralized mechanism for addressing diverse issues related to public services.  Its scope extends beyond just anti-corruption measures.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India, but it does not grant any special powers or autonomy to these councils.
2. The Sixth Schedule was included in the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, primarily to address the unique administrative challenges faced by tribal communities in Assam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), does establish autonomous district councils in specified areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils are granted significant administrative, executive, and legislative powers to govern the affairs of the tribal communities within their respective jurisdictions.  The autonomy granted is substantial.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule's inclusion in the Constitution is directly linked to the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.  This committee recognized the need for a special administrative structure to cater to the specific needs and governance challenges of tribal communities in Assam, particularly in the context of the region’s unique socio-political dynamics.  The committee's recommendations shaped the provisions of the Sixth Schedule.


**8. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPDPA repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, to create a unified legal framework for data protection.
2. Under the DPDPA, the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) has the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for non-compliance, but it lacks the authority to direct data fiduciaries to take remedial measures in case of data breaches.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (DPDPA), is a dedicated legislation for data protection, but it doesn't repeal the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. These acts continue to exist and address other aspects of telecommunications and wireless technology.  The DPDPA focuses specifically on personal data protection and doesn't aim to replace the existing telecommunications legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DPBI under the DPDPA has the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for non-compliance and also to direct them to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach. This power is crucial for enforcing data protection standards and ensuring accountability for data fiduciaries.  The Board's authority extends to both penalties and directives for remedial action.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to solely accelerate the participation of elected representatives in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign's components include structured Gram Sabhas at all three tiers of Panchayats and the utilization of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (JYA) does aim to accelerate people's participation in PDP preparation, it's not limited to elected representatives.  The active involvement of government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders is explicitly mentioned as a crucial element. The focus is on a broader, more inclusive participatory approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The JYA indeed incorporates structured Ward Sabha/Mahila Sabha/Gram Sabha/Block Sabha/District Sabha meetings for PDP preparation at all three Panchayat tiers.  Furthermore, the use of the PDI to pinpoint thematic developmental gaps is a core component of the campaign’s planning process.  The PDI's role in identifying these gaps is directly relevant to the preparation of the GPDP, Block PDP, and District PDP for FY 2025-26.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such centre globally, aiming to establish international standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the audit of local bodies primarily through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level, auditing only funds directly granted by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is indeed the first such center *in India*, aiming to set global standards, but it is not the first globally.  Numerous international organizations and institutions already focus on auditing local governance, although iCAL's specific approach might be unique in certain aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAG's mandate, stemming from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, extends to all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).  While ELFA/DLFA conduct audits under the CAG's supervision, their scope encompasses funds from both state and central governments, not solely central government grants.  The statement misrepresents the extent of the CAG's oversight and the scope of the ELFA/DLFA's audits.


**3. With reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Online Mediation Training Web-Portal, launched by the Supreme Court, is exclusively designed to train judges and judicial officers in mediation techniques, excluding other legal professionals.
2.  The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards only in cases where the arbitration agreement was obtained through fraud or corruption, not considering the contract or award itself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's Online Mediation Training Web-Portal is designed for comprehensive training in mediation, explicitly mentioning its aim to reach legal professionals across the country.  It's not restricted to judges and judicial officers alone.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, broadened the grounds for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards.  It includes situations where the arbitration agreement, the contract itself, *or* the award was obtained through fraud or corruption.  The statement incorrectly limits the grounds for a stay to only fraudulent arbitration agreements.


**4.  With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework of CSSs, based on a 2015 report, focuses exclusively on schemes directly related to poverty alleviation and social justice, excluding other national development priorities.
2.  The funding pattern for core CSSs in the eight North Eastern States and three Himalayan States is 90:10 (Centre:State), while for other states it's 60:40 (Centre:State), with Union Territories without legislatures receiving 100% central funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSSs contribute significantly to poverty alleviation and social justice, their scope is broader than that. The current framework encompasses schemes that contribute to the National Development Agenda and the realization of Vision 2022,  covering various sectors and national priorities. The statement oversimplifies the focus of CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct. This accurately reflects the current funding pattern for core CSSs as described in the provided text. The differential funding ratios based on geographical location and administrative status are correctly stated.


**5. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), under which Mission Karmayogi operates, is limited to training only senior-level civil servants, excluding contractual employees.
2.  Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles emphasize a shift from role-based training to rule-based training and capacity building, focusing on a compliance-driven rather than a competency-driven approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NPCSCB explicitly covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various Union Government entities. The statement erroneously restricts its scope to only senior-level civil servants.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles advocate exactly the opposite: a *shift from rule-based to role-based training* and a *competency-driven approach* to capacity development. The statement completely misrepresents the core philosophy of Mission Karmayogi.


**6. With reference to the AuditOnline application, consider the following statements:**

1. AuditOnline, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2020, is an offline application designed to streamline the audit of panchayat accounts.
2.  AuditOnline has won the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Geneva, primarily for its contribution to enhancing financial transparency and accountability in local governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AuditOnline is an *online* application, not an offline one, facilitating online audit of panchayat accounts. The statement misrepresents the application's functionality.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that AuditOnline did win the award and it does contribute to financial transparency and accountability. However,  the statement oversimplifies the reasons for the award. While financial transparency is a major benefit, the award likely recognized broader aspects of the application's impact on improving governance and utilizing technology effectively.  The explanation of the award's rationale is too simplistic.


**7. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL serves primarily as a knowledge centre and think tank focusing on national-level governance issues, with limited engagement in grassroot-level challenges.
2. iCAL's establishment enhances the independence of local government auditors, aiming to improve financial performance assessment and service delivery, but not necessarily impacting the overall accountability of local bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL's role explicitly includes addressing governance issues at the grassroots level, acting as a knowledge centre and think tank for such challenges.  The statement incorrectly restricts its focus to national-level issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While iCAL's aim to enhance auditor independence does improve financial performance assessment and service delivery, it implicitly contributes to greater accountability of local bodies.  Improved auditing leading to better financial management and service delivery directly impacts overall accountability. The statement understates the impact on accountability.


**8. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recent merger of land portions from 10 cantonment boards with concerned state local bodies signifies a complete abolition of all cantonment boards across India.
2.  Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for the administration and governance of military installations and are not involved in local area governance or civic responsibilities for the civilian population residing within their boundaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The merger of land portions from 10 cantonment boards does not signify the complete abolition of all cantonment boards.  It represents a partial administrative restructuring and transfer of certain responsibilities, not a complete elimination of these boards.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards have a dual role. They manage military installations, but they also govern the civilian areas within their boundaries, providing civic amenities and services to the civilian population residing there.  The statement inaccurately limits their responsibilities solely to military installations.


**9. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and operate in all states and union territories of India, including those with special status like Jammu and Kashmir, and tribal areas.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class, and appeals from their decisions in criminal cases go to the High Court, while appeals in civil cases go directly to the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, specifically exempts certain states and areas, including Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas. The statement incorrectly claims universal applicability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases go to the Court of Session, not the High Court.  Appeals in civil cases go to the District Court, not directly to the Supreme Court.  The statement misrepresents the appellate structure.


**10. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt of court is defined as the willful disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court, but does not include a willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.
2. Criminal contempt includes publishing any matter that scandalizes or lowers the authority of any court, but does not include matters that prejudice or interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The definition of civil contempt explicitly includes willful breach of an undertaking given to a court. The statement omits a crucial element of the definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Criminal contempt also includes publishing matters that prejudice or interfere with the due course of judicial proceedings, or that interfere with or obstruct the administration of justice.  The statement omits significant aspects of the definition of criminal contempt.


**11. With reference to the Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, only the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are declared as Restricted Areas, while Sikkim is entirely a Protected Area.
2.  A foreigner, except a citizen of Bhutan, requires a special permit to visit a Protected or Restricted Area only if they intend to stay for more than 30 days.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim are declared as Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  Sikkim is partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area. The statement incorrectly presents the status of Sikkim.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The requirement for a special permit applies regardless of the duration of the visit; it is not limited to stays exceeding 30 days.  The statement misrepresents the permit requirement.


**12. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution defines the tax bases between the Union and States, but it does not address the distribution of revenue between them.
2. Taxes levied and collected by the Union, such as corporation tax, personal income tax, and central GST, are wholly assigned to the States, with no share for the Union government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule (Article 246) delineates tax bases, and the Constitution also includes provisions (like Articles 268, 269, 269A, 270) that explicitly deal with the distribution of revenue between the Union and the States.  The statement incorrectly claims that the Constitution doesn't address revenue distribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Taxes levied and collected by the Union, such as corporation tax, personal income tax, and central GST, are *not* wholly assigned to the States. The Constitution outlines mechanisms for sharing these revenues between the Union and States, with a portion retained by the Union government. The statement incorrectly claims complete assignment to the States.


**13. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC's 'A' status accreditation by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is a permanent designation, not subject to review or deferral.
2.  The NHRC's primary function is to investigate human rights violations only at the national level, excluding state-level issues and complaints.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI is not permanent.  The text shows that the accreditation has been deferred in the past, indicating it is subject to periodic review and assessment. The statement falsely presents the accreditation as a permanent status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the NHRC deals with national-level issues, it also has jurisdiction to investigate complaints about human rights violations at the state level.  The statement incorrectly limits the NHRC's scope to only national-level issues.


**14. With reference to the Indian Postal Department, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, is still the primary legislation governing the Indian Postal Department, despite significant technological advancements in communication.
2. The Director General of Posts (DGPS) has the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps, but lacks the authority to intercept postal articles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that the Indian Telegraph Act 1885 and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act 1933 have been repealed due to technological advancements.  This implies that the 1898 act is not the *primary* legislation governing the Indian Postal Department, as the legislation has likely been updated or replaced.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DGPS does have the power to make regulations on charges for services and the sale of stamps, and the text also explicitly states that the government *can* intercept postal articles under specified circumstances. The statement incorrectly denies the DGPS's power to make regulations on postal article interception.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to accelerate people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26, focusing on a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  The campaign mandates the use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Sabha level, with a structured process involving Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Block Sabhas, but excludes the participation of youth and elderly individuals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, initially launched as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas', focuses on enhancing people's participation in preparing PDPs.  It explicitly uses a thematic approach aligning with localized SDGs.  The aim is to ensure inclusive and participatory planning at all three tiers of Panchayats.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PDI is indeed used to identify developmental gaps presented in Gram Sabhas, and a structured process involving various Sabhas is followed, the campaign explicitly includes the engagement of youth and elderly (over 75 years) for handholding in GPDP preparation. The statement misrepresents this inclusive participation aspect.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first centre in India aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies, primarily focusing on enhancing the independence of local government auditors to ensure improved financial performance assessment.
2.  iCAL's mandate is solely focused on developing advanced auditing techniques and software, leaving the implementation of online auditing systems and capacity building of auditors to other institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes iCAL's key objectives. It highlights its pioneering role in setting global standards for local governance audits in India.  The centre's focus on enhancing auditor independence to improve financial assessments and service delivery is also correctly mentioned.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While iCAL does act as a centre of excellence, its role extends beyond just developing auditing techniques. The text explicitly states that it serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors and focuses on capacity building for auditors.  The implementation of online auditing systems like AuditOnline is a separate initiative, not the sole responsibility of iCAL.


**3. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the proper maintenance of accounts and auditing for all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states.
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Rural Development, facilitates online audits of panchayat accounts but lacks integration with the CAG's auditing framework and doesn't contribute to ensuring accountability in fund utilization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly outlines the CAG's role and the mechanism used for auditing local bodies.  The CAG's authority stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, and the implementation is carried out through ELFA/DLFA under the CAG's supervision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj (not Rural Development), is designed to improve accountability in fund utilization at the ground level by facilitating online audits.  The passage explicitly states that it is part of the CAG's framework, implying integration, and contributes to ensuring accountability.


**4. With reference to the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi aims to create a future-ready civil service through competency-driven capacity development, focusing on a shift from rule-based to role-based training, covering all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various government entities.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), launched as part of Mission Karmayogi, solely focuses on developing and delivering online training modules, neglecting other crucial aspects of capacity building such as mentorship programs and on-the-job training.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the goals and scope of Mission Karmayogi.  It emphasizes the shift towards competency-based training, role-based learning, and the inclusion of all civil servants, regardless of employment type.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CBC plays a significant role, its responsibilities are not limited to online training modules. The passage does not suggest that the CBC solely focuses on online modules, neglecting other important aspects of capacity development.  The overall aim of Mission Karmayogi is a holistic approach to civil service capacity building.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in the Indian Government:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, are the designated nodal agencies for handling grievances at the Union Government level, utilizing platforms like CPGRAMS for online grievance redressal.
2.  State-level grievance redressal mechanisms are entirely independent of the Union Government's systems, with no coordination or integration between the two levels, creating a fragmented approach to grievance handling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly identifies the key nodal agencies (DARPG and Directorate of Public Grievances) and the role of CPGRAMS in the Union Government's GRM.  The description accurately reflects the established system for handling citizen grievances at the national level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While states have their own grievance redressal mechanisms, the passage doesn't suggest a complete lack of coordination or integration with the Union Government.  The mention of CPGRAMS connecting with state-level officers indicates some level of integration and coordination. The statement oversimplifies the complex relationship between state and central grievance mechanisms.


**6. With reference to the Sevottam model, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sevottam model is a comprehensive framework for improving public service delivery, encompassing three key modules: Citizen's Charter, Grievance Redressal Mechanism, and Capacity Building for Service Delivery, focusing on enhancing citizen satisfaction and service quality.
2. The Sevottam model's implementation is solely dependent on the central government, with no involvement or participation expected from state governments or local bodies in adapting or implementing its principles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Sevottam model, its three core modules, and its overall objective of improving public service delivery and citizen satisfaction. The description aligns with the model's holistic approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does not restrict the Sevottam model's implementation to only the central government. While the source of the model might be central,  its application and adaptation to state-specific contexts would naturally involve state governments and local bodies to ensure effective implementation. The statement wrongly assumes a centralized and inflexible implementation process.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the  process of devolution of taxes in India:**

1.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union are distributed between the Union and States based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission, with vertical devolution referring to the share of states from the divisible pool and horizontal devolution referring to distribution among states based on criteria like income distance, area, and population.
2. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations for horizontal devolution exclusively prioritized population size, disregarding factors such as income distance, area, or demographic performance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the process of tax devolution in India, distinguishing between vertical and horizontal devolution and mentioning the role of the Finance Commission. The criteria for horizontal devolution, including income distance, area, and population, are correctly identified.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations for horizontal devolution included multiple criteria, not just population size.  Income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts were all considered, each with a specific weight. The statement misrepresents the commission's approach.


**8. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. SCS is a classification granted by the Centre to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, initially including states like Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland.
2. The criteria for granting SCS are static and haven't been revised since 1969, with no consideration given to evolving socio-economic conditions or the emergence of new challenges faced by different states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the genesis and initial application of SCS.  It accurately points out the Fifth Finance Commission's role and mentions some of the first states granted this status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage doesn't state that the criteria for SCS are immutable.  While the initial criteria were set in 1969, it's highly probable that the criteria for granting SCS have been reviewed and adjusted over time to reflect changing socio-economic realities and the emergence of new challenges. The statement wrongly assumes a static and unchanging system.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, came into force in October 2005, replacing the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and provides citizens with the right to access information under the control of Public Authorities (PAs).  The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P) coordinates its implementation.
2. The RTI Act explicitly states that access to information is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution, overriding all other considerations and limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly summarizes the RTI Act's key features, including its enactment date, its replacement of the earlier Freedom of Information Act, and the coordinating agency's role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court's judgment in the `Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government` case established a link between RTI and Article 19, the RTI Act itself doesn't explicitly declare access to information as a fundamental right under Article 19. The Act provides the right to information but also has provisions for exemptions and limitations.  The statement misrepresents the Act's legal standing.


**10. With reference to the  Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) is empowered to impose penalties for non-compliance with the Act, direct data fiduciaries to address data breaches, and hear grievances from affected persons, with appeals against its decisions lying with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).
2. The Bill mandates that all data principals must register with the DPBI, regardless of the nature or sensitivity of their data, and failure to do so will result in immediate penalties and legal action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the powers and functions of the DPBI as outlined in the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023.  Its role in enforcement, grievance redressal, and the appellate process is correctly described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bill does not mandate registration for all data principals.  The requirement for registration and the implications of non-compliance would depend on factors like the volume and sensitivity of data processed, as determined by the Act.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate representation of the registration requirements.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 exclusively empowers the President to commute death sentences, not grant pardons or reprieves.
2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This includes death sentences, but it's not limited to them. The power is broader than just commuting death sentences.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has the power of judicial review over many governmental actions, the President's decision on a mercy petition is generally considered to be final and not directly subject to judicial review.  There's no established legal precedent for directly challenging the President's decision on a mercy petition in court.  The courts might intervene indirectly if there are procedural irregularities or fundamental rights violations in the process leading to the President's decision, but not the decision itself.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been rejected, and it challenges the very basis of the Supreme Court's judgment.
2. The curative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is explicitly mentioned in Article 137 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court. It addresses fundamental flaws in the judgment, such as violations of natural justice, undisclosed connections of judges, or clear apprehension of bias.  It's not merely a re-examination of the evidence or arguments presented earlier; it challenges the very foundation of the judgment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The curative power of the Supreme Court doesn't stem directly from Article 137 (which deals with review petitions). Instead, it flows from Article 142, which grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice. The curative petition mechanism evolved through judicial pronouncements, primarily in *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr.*,  and is not a codified, constitutionally explicit power.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established under a state-sponsored scheme, primarily funded by individual state governments.
2. The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other heinous crimes against women.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 and extended until 2026.  The funding is primarily borne by the central government from the Nirbhaya Fund, not individual state governments. While states contribute to infrastructure and operational costs, the major financial burden rests with the Centre.

Statement 2 is correct. FTSCs aim to ensure speedy trials of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act. The scheme's core purpose is to reduce the backlog of cases and provide quicker justice to victims of these serious crimes.  The focus is on efficient case management and swift disposal, leading to a faster resolution process.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the devolution of taxes between the Union and States in India:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the vertical devolution of taxes, but the horizontal devolution is determined solely by the Union Government.
2.  Grants-in-aid provided to states by the Union Government are governed by Article 275 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in both vertical and horizontal devolution.  While the Commission recommends the share of divisible pool (vertical devolution) to be distributed between the Union and States, it also suggests criteria and principles for distributing that share among states (horizontal devolution). The Union Government accepts these recommendations, but the process involves the Finance Commission's expertise and recommendations for both aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution deals with grants-in-aid from the Union to states. This article allows the Union government to make grants to any state that is in need of financial assistance.  These grants are not part of tax devolution; they are supplementary financial support based on the state's needs and circumstances.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) for states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for granting SCS are explicitly defined in the Constitution of India.
2.  The decision to grant SCS rests solely with the Union Government, without any involvement of the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly define criteria for granting SCS.  The criteria have evolved over time, primarily based on the recommendations of various Finance Commissions.  Factors considered include geographical disadvantages, socio-economic backwardness, and developmental challenges faced by the state.  There's no rigid, constitutional definition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Union Government ultimately decides on whether to grant SCS, the Finance Commission's recommendations significantly influence this decision. The Commission's assessment of a state's financial situation and developmental needs plays a critical role in the Union Government's consideration of SCS.  It's not a solely executive decision.


**6. With reference to the suspension of internet services, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to suspend internet services is vested solely with the Central Government.
2.  Any order suspending internet services must adhere to the principle of proportionality and is subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Central Government has significant powers, the authority to suspend internet services isn't solely vested with them.  State Governments can also issue such orders under relevant laws, subject to existing legal frameworks and judicial scrutiny.  The specific legal basis for such suspension varies depending on the situation and applicable laws.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court has emphasized the principle of proportionality in cases related to internet shutdowns.  This means that any restriction on internet access must be necessary, proportionate to the threat, and of limited duration.  Furthermore, such orders are subject to judicial review; courts can examine the legality and reasonableness of internet suspension orders.



**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Consumer Protection Act (CPA), 2019:**

1.  The CPA, 2019, explicitly excludes services rendered by lawyers from its purview.
2.  The Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) has the power to conduct inquiries and investigations into consumer-related matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CPA, 2019, initially had some ambiguity regarding the inclusion of legal services. However, the Supreme Court clarified that services provided by lawyers are not automatically excluded. The Act's broad definition of "service" can encompass legal services, depending on the specific circumstances.  The exclusion isn't absolute.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CCPA is a central authority established under the CPA, 2019, with powers to promote, protect, and enforce consumer rights.  Crucially, it has an investigation wing to conduct inquiries and investigations into consumer-related complaints and issues.  This is a key feature of the strengthened consumer protection framework.


**8. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is a state-level legislation.
2.  The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is a central (Union) legislation, not a state-level one.  The administration of cantonments is a subject under the Union List, reflecting the central government's control over these areas with significant military presence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander, typically a senior military officer, holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board.  This reflects the military's administrative oversight of cantonments, although the Board also has civilian members and responsibilities.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Supreme Court's recent judgment on climate change:**

1. The judgment explicitly recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.
2. The judgment was delivered in a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court's judgment did significantly expand the scope of fundamental rights related to environmental protection, it primarily linked the right to a healthy environment to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life). Article 19 (freedom of speech, etc.) wasn't the central focus of the judgment in this context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The judgment was indeed delivered within the context of a writ petition concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, highlighting the court's concern for environmental conservation and its impact on fundamental rights.  The case served as a vehicle for the court to address broader environmental issues.


**10. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates forensic investigation for all criminal offences.
2.  The Act explicitly permits the submission of oral evidence electronically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act doesn't mandate forensic investigation for *all* criminal offences.  The requirement for forensic investigation depends on the nature and severity of the crime.  It's typically mandated for offences punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment, not all crimes.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, is the provision for submitting oral evidence electronically. This modernizes the legal process and allows for more efficient and accessible testimony, especially in cases where witnesses may be geographically dispersed or have limited mobility.


**11.  Consider the following statements concerning the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023:**

1. The Act establishes a comprehensive data protection authority with extensive powers to regulate data processing across all sectors.
2. The Act grants individuals the right to data portability, allowing them to transfer their personal data between different data fiduciaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the Data Protection Board of India, a regulatory body with significant powers to oversee data processing practices in the country.  The Board has the authority to issue directions, impose penalties, and ensure compliance with the Act's provisions across various sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act includes provisions related to data portability.  This right allows individuals to obtain their personal data in a commonly used and machine-readable format and to transmit this data to another data fiduciary, enhancing their control over their information.  This is a significant aspect of the Act's focus on individual data rights.


**12. With reference to the State Election Commission (SEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The SEC is responsible for delimiting constituencies for Lok Sabha elections.
2.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts mandate the establishment of SECs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SEC is responsible for delimiting constituencies for *local body* elections (municipalities, panchayats), not Lok Sabha elections. Delimitation of Lok Sabha and state legislative assembly constituencies is the responsibility of the Delimitation Commission, a separate body established under Article 82 of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992, which address Panchayati Raj institutions and municipalities, respectively, mandate the constitution of State Election Commissions to conduct elections to these local bodies.  The Acts provide the constitutional basis for the SEC's existence and functions.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Delimitation Commission:**

1. The Delimitation Commission's orders are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
2. The Delimitation Commission is a constitutional body established under Article 80 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While traditionally considered final and unchallengeable, the Supreme Court has clarified in recent judgments that its orders are not completely immune from judicial review.  If an order is demonstrably arbitrary or violates fundamental rights, the Court can intervene. The scope of review is limited, but not entirely absent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Delimitation Commission is a *statutory*, not a constitutional body.  Its establishment is governed by a law passed by Parliament (as per Article 82), not directly by the Constitution itself.  Article 82 specifies that the process of delimitation will be decided by law, and the Commission's formation is a result of that legislative action.


**14. With reference to Indian Passports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports is exclusively the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs.
2.  The Central Government can issue passports to non-citizens in specific circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, although there might be other agencies involved in the passport application process like Passport Seva Kendras, the ultimate authority and responsibility for issuing passports lies with the Ministry of External Affairs of the Government of India.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Passport Act allows the Central Government to issue passports to individuals who are not citizens of India if it is deemed necessary in the public interest. This provision is usually applied in exceptional circumstances and is subject to the government's discretion.


**15.  Consider the following statements regarding Common Service Centres (CSCs):**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on delivering government services to urban populations.
2. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a private sector initiative aimed at promoting digital literacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSCs are designed to deliver government and private sector services to *rural* areas, bridging the digital divide and providing access to essential services in underserved locations.  Their main focus is on extending reach to rural citizens.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CSC SPV is set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, making it a government initiative, not a private sector one.  While it aims to promote digital access, it's a government-led effort to expand the reach of digital services, not a private sector promotion of digital literacy.


**16. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the President to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
2.  The PESA Act, 1996, applies to areas covered under the Fifth Schedule but not to those under the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule empowers the *Governor*, not the President, to create ADCs and ARCs in the specified states. The Governor's power in this context is a key aspect of the Sixth Schedule's provisions for autonomy in tribal areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Panchayats (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996 (PESA), applies to areas under the Fifth Schedule, which covers scheduled areas in various states.  The Sixth Schedule has its own provisions for autonomy and governance, and PESA doesn't apply to those areas.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding the formation of new states in India:**

1.  The process of forming a new state requires a simple majority in both Houses of Parliament.
2.  The President's recommendation is mandatory before introducing a Bill in Parliament for the formation of a new state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The formation of a new state requires a special majority in Parliament – not a simple majority.  This reflects the significance of altering the boundaries and structure of the Indian federation.  It needs more than just a simple majority vote.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 of the Constitution explicitly requires the President's recommendation before a Bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in either House of Parliament.  This ensures the executive branch's involvement and approval in this significant constitutional process.


**18. With reference to Zero FIRs, consider the following statements:**

1. Zero FIRs can only be registered in cases related to crimes against women and children.
2. The concept of Zero FIR was introduced by the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Zero FIRs are not limited to crimes against women and children.  They can be registered for any cognizable offense, regardless of the location where the crime occurred. The purpose is to ensure that a complaint is registered promptly without delay due to jurisdictional issues.

Statement 2 is correct. The provision for Zero FIRs is a part of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (the new Criminal Code), based on recommendations from the Justice Verma Committee.  It's a significant reform aimed at improving the efficiency and accessibility of crime reporting.


**19. Consider the following statements regarding the Doctrine of Coverture:**

1. The Doctrine of Coverture is a principle of English common law that continues to be fully applicable in India's legal system.
2. The Doctrine of Coverture, in essence, merged the legal identity of a married woman with that of her husband.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture is a principle of English common law, but it's not fully applicable in India's current legal system.  Indian law has significantly evolved to grant women independent legal identities and rights, moving away from the principles of Coverture.  Although some remnants might be debated in specific legal contexts, it's not a comprehensively applicable doctrine.

Statement 2 is correct.  The essence of the Doctrine of Coverture was the legal subordination of a married woman to her husband.  Her legal identity was essentially subsumed within his, limiting her capacity to own property, enter contracts, or sue independently.  This is a fundamental characteristic of the doctrine.


**20.  With reference to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction mandates that conflicting provisions within a statute must be resolved by prioritizing the provision enacted later in time.
2.  The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction is primarily used to resolve inconsistencies between different statutes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction doesn't automatically prioritize later-enacted provisions when resolving conflicts within a single statute.  It seeks to interpret all provisions in a way that gives effect to each, avoiding contradictions and creating a harmonious and consistent overall meaning.  The chronological order of enactment is not the sole deciding factor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction can be applied to resolve inconsistencies between different statutes, its primary application is within a *single* statute.  It aims to reconcile potentially conflicting provisions within the same legal instrument to create a coherent and workable whole.  It's not limited to inter-statutory conflicts.  It is applied even in case of no conflict.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, with Barrackpore being the first.
2.  The administration of Cantonment Boards falls under the purview of the state governments, as per the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonments, primarily designed to house military troops, were indeed established by the British East India Company following the Battle of Plassey in 1757.  Barrackpore near Calcutta was the first such cantonment, established in 1765. This reflects the historical context of cantonment development in India, crucial for understanding their current governance structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with local self-governance, the administration of Cantonment Boards is specifically a subject matter of the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List), not state governments.  This highlights the unique constitutional position of cantonments, reflecting their connection to national defense.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, further governs their administration under the Ministry of Defence, emphasizing their distinct status within India's federal structure.


**2. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to a healthy environment to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, expanding the scope of fundamental rights.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in the 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others' case specifically addressed the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, thereby establishing a precedent for environmental protection through judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The Supreme Court has indeed broadened the interpretation of fundamental rights, specifically Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), to encompass the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. This reflects a progressive judicial approach towards environmental protection, recognizing its intrinsic link to fundamental human rights.  The case of 'M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others', concerning the Great Indian Bustard, served as a vehicle for this landmark judgment.  This case demonstrates the judiciary's role in using its powers to expand the scope of fundamental rights to include environmental concerns, creating a significant precedent for future cases.


**3. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and came into force in October 2005.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, is the coordinating agency for the implementation of the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The RTI Act, 2005, is a landmark piece of legislation that strengthened access to information for citizens. It superseded the earlier Freedom of Information Act, 2002, demonstrating a commitment to greater transparency and accountability.  The effective date of October 2005 is a key fact to remember.  Further, the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions plays a crucial role in coordinating the implementation of the RTI Act, showcasing the government's commitment to the act's effective functioning.


**4. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only in cases involving offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons extends to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in a broader range of cases, including those where the sentence is by a court-martial and those involving offences against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the President's power.

Statement 2 is correct. The President's power under Article 72 explicitly includes the authority to deal with sentences awarded by court-martials, highlighting the extent of executive clemency in military matters.  This is a crucial aspect of the President's role as the Supreme Commander of the armed forces.


**5. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition is the last available constitutional remedy for a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it is based on the Supreme Court's power under Article 142 to do complete justice.
2.  The concept of a curative petition was established through the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr., and it can be filed only if there is a violation of the principles of natural justice or if there is an apprehension of bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The curative petition serves as the final recourse within the Indian judicial system for a petitioner whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  This is a critical aspect of the judicial system's checks and balances.  The Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142 to ensure complete justice underpins the existence of curative petitions.  The case of Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr. is landmark in establishing the procedural framework for filing and adjudicating curative petitions.  The grounds for filing such a petition include violations of natural justice or the apprehension of bias, illustrating the court's commitment to fairness and due process.


**6. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme funded entirely by the states, aiming to expedite the disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act.
2.  As of a recent report, over 750 FTSCs, including exclusive POCSO courts, are functional across various states and union territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at expediting rape and POCSO cases, their funding comes primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund, a central government initiative.  This highlights the central government's role in supporting the judicial infrastructure for addressing these serious crimes.  The statement misrepresents the funding source.

Statement 2 is correct. A significant number of FTSCs, including those dedicated exclusively to POCSO cases (ePOCSO Courts), are indeed operational across various states and union territories, reflecting progress in enhancing the efficiency of the judicial system in handling these sensitive cases.


**7. With reference to the State Election Commission (SEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments mandated the establishment of SECs, following recommendations from the Gadgil Committee.
2.  The SEC's functions include delimiting constituencies for local body elections, overseeing the preparation and revision of electoral rolls, and deciding disputes related to local body elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendments played a crucial role in establishing the State Election Commissions (SECs) to oversee the conduct of local body elections, reflecting a commitment to democratic decentralization.  The Gadgil Committee's recommendations significantly influenced this constitutional reform. The SEC's responsibilities include delimiting constituencies, managing electoral rolls, addressing election-related disputes, and ensuring fair representation, including reservations for Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes.  These functions are essential for the fair and efficient conduct of local body elections.


**8. With reference to the Delimitation Commission in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Delimitation Commission is a constitutional body established under Article 82 of the Constitution, responsible for fixing the number of seats and boundaries of constituencies for Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.
2.  The Supreme Court has ruled that the orders of the Delimitation Commission are final and unchallengeable in any court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Delimitation Commission determines the number of seats and boundaries of constituencies, it is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. Its establishment is authorized by Parliament under Article 82, which allows Parliament to determine the authority and manner of delimitation. The statement mischaracterizes the legal basis of the Commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Recent Supreme Court judgments have clarified that constitutional courts do have the power to review orders of the Delimitation Commission if they are found to be manifestly arbitrary. This demonstrates the judiciary's role in ensuring fairness and upholding constitutional principles even in the context of delimitation.  The statement incorrectly asserts the absolute finality of the Commission's decisions.


**9. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, the entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and a part of Sikkim are designated as Restricted Areas.
2.  Foreigners, excluding Bhutanese citizens, require special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, designates specific areas as Restricted Areas, including the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim. This reflects the government's concern for national security and the preservation of sensitive areas.  The need for special permits for foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) to enter these areas is a crucial regulatory measure, ensuring controlled access to strategically important or environmentally sensitive regions.


**10. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the tax bases for the Union and State governments, and the distribution of revenue is primarily guided by the recommendations of the Finance Commission.
2.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union government but wholly assigned to the states are distributed based on criteria such as population, area, and income distance, as determined by the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Fiscal federalism in India is a complex arrangement governed by the Constitution. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution clearly defines the powers of taxation for both the Union and State governments, forming the basis for their financial autonomy.  The Finance Commission plays a central role in recommending the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States, ensuring a fair and equitable sharing of resources.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to states are indeed distributed among states based on criteria recommended by the Finance Commission, reflecting a multi-faceted approach to resource allocation.  These criteria typically include factors such as population, area, and income distance, aiming for a balance between different states' needs.


**11. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was introduced on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, and states granted SCS receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
2.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states, and the 14th Finance Commission ended the SCS system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The concept of Special Category Status (SCS) was indeed introduced based on recommendations from the Fifth Finance Commission, and states given this status historically received financial assistance based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  However, it's important to note that the formula itself has evolved over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly provide for the categorization of states as SCS states.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to a shift in the approach to providing special assistance to states, effectively ending the formal SCS system, but this was not a constitutional amendment.  The statement misrepresents both the constitutional basis and the finality of the change.


**12. With reference to Special Packages for States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Special Packages are provided to states facing geographical and socio-economic challenges, offering additional financial assistance under Article 282 of the Constitution.
2.  The allocation of Special Packages is based on objective criteria and is not discretionary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Special Packages are indeed provided to states facing significant geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  These packages provide additional financial assistance beyond the normal devolution of funds and are often granted to address specific needs or challenges. Article 282 of the Constitution provides the legal basis for such discretionary grants.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The allocation of Special Packages is largely discretionary, meaning it is not based on rigid, pre-defined criteria.  While the need for assistance is a factor, the decision to provide a special package is often influenced by political and other considerations, making it a flexible instrument of central government policy.


**13. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was a result of recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee and provides for the administration of tribal areas in certain states.
2.  The Sixth Schedule allows for the establishment of autonomous district councils with significant legislative and administrative powers within their respective areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, under Article 244(2), was indeed a product of the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, addressing the unique administrative needs of tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The Schedule's provisions allow for the establishment of autonomous district councils, granting them considerable legislative and administrative autonomy within their respective regions.  This reflects a policy of protecting the interests of tribal communities and promoting their self-governance.


**14. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and introduces a framework for spectrum allocation through auctions and administrative allocation for specified purposes.
2.  The Act establishes a new regulatory framework for Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, aimed at modernizing the telecommunications sector, did indeed repeal the older Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. It introduced a contemporary framework for spectrum allocation, incorporating auctions and administrative allocation for specific purposes like national security and disaster management.  This reflects a shift towards a more efficient and transparent allocation process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act does *not* establish a new regulatory framework for Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms.  OTT platforms remain outside the purview of this particular Act, indicating that their regulation is likely addressed through other legislation or policy measures.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the Act.


**15. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data while balancing the interests of data principals and data fiduciaries.
2.  The Act establishes a Data Protection Board to oversee the implementation of the Act and address grievances related to data protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, is a significant piece of legislation aimed at regulating the processing of digital personal data in India. It strives to balance the interests of individuals (data principals) who own their data and the entities (data fiduciaries) that process it.  This balance is crucial for promoting innovation while safeguarding individual rights.  The Act also establishes a Data Protection Board to effectively oversee its implementation and resolve any grievances related to data protection, illustrating a commitment to robust enforcement.


**1. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a statutory body established under the Indian Constitution.
2. The selection panel for the CBI Director comprises the Prime Minister, the Home Minister, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is a non-statutory body, established in 1963 based on the recommendations of the Santhanam Committee.  It operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, not the Constitution.  While it plays a crucial role in investigating significant crimes, its legal foundation is distinct from constitutional bodies.  The lack of constitutional backing also impacts its jurisdiction and powers, often leading to legal challenges regarding its authority to investigate in certain states without their consent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The selection panel for the CBI Director consists of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India.  The inclusion of the Leader of the Opposition, rather than the Home Minister, is a significant aspect of its composition, aimed at ensuring a degree of political neutrality in the appointment process.  This tripartite structure is designed to balance executive, legislative, and judicial oversight.  The Home Minister's role is primarily administrative, not directly involved in the selection of the Director.


**2. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2023 to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26.
2. The campaign exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayats, excluding Block and District Panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as the People's Plan Campaign or PPC), was launched in 2018 under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. The recent news refers to its renewed implementation for the preparation of PDPs for 2025-26, but the original launch date was 2018.  This highlights the cyclical nature of such planning initiatives and the ongoing need for participatory rural development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan encompasses all three tiers of Panchayats: Gram Panchayats, Block Panchayats, and District Panchayats.  The structured meetings (Ward Sabha, Mahila Sabha, Gram Sabha, Block Sabha, District Sabha) are explicitly designed to ensure participation at all levels in the planning process.  This multi-tiered approach reflects the decentralized governance structure in India and the importance of bottom-up planning for effective rural development.  Ignoring any of these levels would severely limit the campaign's impact.



**3. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is the first such centre in the world.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) audits local bodies through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is the first such center *in India*, not the world.  While it aims to set global standards, there are established international organizations and initiatives focused on local governance auditing. The claim of being the first globally is an overstatement. The significance of iCAL lies in its potential to improve auditing standards within India and potentially influence practices in other countries, but it does not represent a global first.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971.  The ELFA/DLFA, operating under the CAG's supervision, are instrumental in conducting these audits at the state level. This highlights the hierarchical structure of audit oversight in India, with the CAG at the apex and state-level functionaries carrying out the actual audits.  The system, while established, faces challenges related to capacity, resources, and independence, which are issues that iCAL aims to address.


**4. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 50% share of divisible pool to be devolved to the states.
2.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided by the Centre as per Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool to be devolved to the states, not 50%. This figure represents the proportion of central tax revenue allocated to states, a crucial aspect of fiscal federalism.  The actual percentage can fluctuate based on various factors and the recommendations of each Finance Commission, reflecting the dynamic nature of revenue sharing in a federal system.  The difference between the actual and the stated percentage highlights the importance of understanding the specifics of the Finance Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution explicitly empowers the Centre to provide grants-in-aid to states. These grants serve as an important mechanism for addressing regional disparities and supporting states with limited fiscal capacity.  The provision demonstrates the constitutional recognition of the need for financial equalization among states within the federal framework.  The use of grants-in-aid highlights the complexities of balancing central control with state autonomy in a federal system.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. SCS is granted by the President of India based on socio-economic backwardness and geographical limitations.
2.  The criteria for granting SCS are clearly defined in the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President plays a role in the process, SCS is granted by the Central government, not directly by the President. The decision is based on recommendations and assessments of socio-economic conditions and geographical constraints, but the formal grant comes from the Union government.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the political dynamics and decision-making process involved in granting SCS.  The involvement of the Central government highlights the complexities of Centre-State relations in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The criteria for granting SCS are not explicitly defined in the Constitution.  The criteria have evolved over time based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions and the government's assessment of the needs of particular states.  This flexibility allows for adaptation to changing circumstances, but it also raises concerns about transparency and consistency in granting SCS.  The lack of codified criteria often leads to political debates and controversies surrounding SCS applications.  The absence of clear constitutional guidelines allows for political considerations to play a significant role in the decision-making process.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information Act (RTI), consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act mandates that all information should be disclosed within 7 days of the request.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is a constitutional body.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act mandates that information should be provided within 30 days of the request.  For matters concerning life or liberty, the timeframe is reduced to 48 hours.  The 7-day timeframe is a misrepresentation of the actual provisions.  The difference between the actual and stated timeframe emphasizes the importance of understanding the precise provisions of the act, especially for citizens seeking timely access to information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CIC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It is established under the RTI Act, 2005, not the Constitution. The distinction is crucial for understanding the legal standing and authority of the CIC.  Statutory bodies are subject to legislative changes, while constitutional bodies enjoy greater protection and independence.  The difference in status reflects the varying degrees of protection afforded to different institutions involved in governance.


**7. With reference to the Aadhaar system in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Aadhaar card serves as definitive proof of citizenship.
2.  The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) can deactivate or delete Aadhaar numbers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Aadhaar card is primarily a proof of identity, not definitive proof of citizenship.  While it is widely used to establish identity, it does not automatically confer citizenship.  The distinction is important, especially in the context of legal and administrative processes where citizenship status is a critical factor.  The Supreme Court has also clarified that Aadhaar is not a conclusive document for proving citizenship.

Statement 2 is correct. The UIDAI has the authority to deactivate or delete Aadhaar numbers under specific circumstances. This power is essential for maintaining the integrity and security of the Aadhaar database.  The ability to deactivate or delete accounts is a necessary safeguard against fraud, misuse, and other issues that could compromise the system.  This power, however, is subject to regulations and procedures to ensure due process and prevent arbitrary actions.


**8. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to enforce data protection provisions.
2.  The Act grants unlimited powers to data fiduciaries to collect and process personal data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI to oversee data protection compliance and address grievances.  This reflects the growing importance of data privacy and the need for an independent body to enforce related regulations.  The creation of the DPBI highlights India's efforts to align its data protection framework with international standards and best practices. The board's powers include monitoring, imposing penalties, and directing data fiduciaries to take action in case of data breaches.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act does *not* grant unlimited powers to data fiduciaries. It specifies obligations and limitations on the collection and processing of personal data, balancing the interests of data fiduciaries with the rights of data principals.  The Act's provisions emphasize the need for responsible data handling and accountability, preventing misuse and protecting individual privacy.  The limitations imposed on data fiduciaries are crucial for safeguarding data privacy and preventing arbitrary collection and processing of personal information.  The act establishes clear guidelines and limitations on the collection, use, and storage of personal data, reflecting a balance between innovation and privacy.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for offenses against any Union law, but excludes cases involving sentences imposed by state courts for state laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Article 72 of the Indian Constitution explicitly grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute sentences in certain cases.  Statement 1 accurately reflects a significant portion of this power:  the President can act in cases involving offenses against any law relating to a matter under the Union's executive power.  This includes a wide range of offenses, but isn't limited to only those.  Statement 2 is incorrect because it wrongly limits the President's power. Article 72's scope extends to sentences imposed by courts-martial and those for offenses against Union laws, but it also critically encompasses death sentences and cases where the sentence is imposed by a court for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, irrespective of whether the court is at the state or Union level.  The crucial element is the nature of the offense, not the court that imposed the sentence.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the breadth of the President's power under Article 72.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a review petition and is the final legal recourse available to a litigant.
2. The Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is derived from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice, and it necessitates demonstrating a violation of principles of natural justice or apprehension of bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements correctly describe aspects of curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India. Statement 1 accurately positions the curative petition as the last resort available after the rejection of a review petition. It signifies the exhaustion of all ordinary legal avenues within the judicial system.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the source of the Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions as stemming from Article 142, which grants the court the power to do complete justice.  The statement also accurately highlights that filing a curative petition requires demonstrating a serious procedural flaw, such as a violation of principles of natural justice or a clear apprehension of bias that significantly impacted the judgment.  This high threshold ensures that curative petitions are not used frivolously. Thus, both statements provide accurate information regarding curative petitions.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs, a centrally sponsored scheme, are primarily funded through the Nirbhaya Fund and aim to expedite the disposal of cases under the POCSO Act.
2.  As of a recent report, over 750 FTSCs, including a significant number of exclusive POCSO courts, are operational across more than 25 states and union territories.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the FTSCs. They are indeed a centrally sponsored scheme funded by the Nirbhaya Fund, established to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and those related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.  Statement 2, however, contains an inaccuracy regarding the number of operational FTSCs and their geographical spread. While the number of FTSCs is close to the figure stated, the exact number and the number of states and union territories where they are functional may differ slightly depending on the latest available data. Such figures are dynamic and subject to change as new courts are established and become operational. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate based on the consistent information available.


**4. With reference to Zero FIRs, consider the following statements:**

1.  A Zero FIR is registered at any police station, regardless of the location where the offense occurred, and is subsequently transferred to the appropriate jurisdiction for investigation.
2. The legal basis for Zero FIRs is derived from Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, reflecting recommendations from the Justice Verma Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe key aspects of Zero FIRs.  Statement 1 correctly explains the core function of a Zero FIR: it's registered at any police station, irrespective of the crime's location, to ensure immediate reporting and prevent delays. This initial registration facilitates the later transfer to the appropriate police station for investigation. Statement 2 correctly points to the legal foundation of Zero FIRs within the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, emphasizing its alignment with the recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee, which was formed in the aftermath of the 2012 Nirbhaya rape case. The committee suggested this mechanism to improve the efficiency and accessibility of crime reporting.  Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of the concept and legal framework surrounding Zero FIRs.


**5. With reference to the Doctrine of Coverture, consider the following statements:**

1.  Originating in English common law, the Doctrine of Coverture treated a married woman as a legal entity separate from her husband, granting her independent legal rights.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in Joseph Shine v. Union of India (2018) affirmed the continued relevance and applicability of the Doctrine of Coverture in contemporary Indian law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture, originating in English common law, did *not* treat a married woman as a separate legal entity. Instead, it subsumed her legal identity within her husband's, effectively depriving her of many legal rights and protections.  She lacked the capacity to own property independently, enter contracts, or even sue or be sued in her own name. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) explicitly *rejected* the Doctrine of Coverture's applicability in the context of criminalizing marital rape. The court recognized the outdated and discriminatory nature of this doctrine and its incompatibility with modern gender equality principles.  Therefore, neither statement is accurate.


**6. With reference to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction mandates that all provisions of a statute must be interpreted in a manner that creates internal contradictions and inconsistencies.
2.  The Supreme Court's application of the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction involves exercising discretionary powers, such as condoning delays in filing appeals or applications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Harmonious Construction aims to interpret all parts of a statute in a way that avoids conflicts and inconsistencies. The goal is to create a coherent and internally consistent legal framework. The interpretation should prioritize a harmonious reading of provisions, resolving any apparent contradictions to ensure all parts work together effectively. Statement 2 accurately describes a key aspect of the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction. When applying this doctrine, courts often exercise discretionary powers, including the power to condone delays in filing appeals or applications.  This demonstrates flexibility in applying legal principles to achieve justice. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**7. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, function as courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class and are located at the headquarters of intermediate Panchayats.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas operate as mobile courts, possessing both civil and criminal jurisdiction to resolve minor disputes, and are bound by the rules of evidence as per the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, establishes Gram Nyayalayas as courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class. These courts are strategically located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters to enhance accessibility for rural populations. Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas do function as mobile courts with both civil and criminal jurisdiction to resolve petty disputes, they are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. Instead, they operate based on the principles of natural justice, prioritizing fairness and equity in their proceedings.  The emphasis is on informal dispute resolution and conciliation.  Thus, only statement 1 provides an accurate description.


**8. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is explicitly derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct. Statement 1 accurately distinguishes between civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt arises from willful disobedience of court orders, decrees, or processes. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, involves actions that undermine the authority of the court, such as scandalizing or lowering its prestige or interfering with the administration of justice.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the constitutional basis for the power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt. Article 129 grants this power to the Supreme Court, while Article 215 confers the same power on High Courts.  This constitutional provision underscores the importance of maintaining the dignity and authority of the judicial system.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the legal aspects of contempt of court.


**9. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) for states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provisions for granting SCS are explicitly outlined in the Constitution of India, enabling the Centre to provide financial assistance to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS, with current special funding patterns for Northeastern and Himalayan states being based on different criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* contain any explicit provisions for granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states.  While the Centre has historically provided special assistance to certain states based on socio-economic and geographical factors, this practice isn't based on a specific constitutional mandate. Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations resulted in the phasing out of the SCS.  Current special funding for states like those in the Northeast and Himalayan regions is now based on other criteria, often involving need-based assessments and specific developmental projects rather than the blanket categorization of SCS. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**10. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, originating from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in all states with significant tribal populations.
2.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers over subjects like land revenue, taxation, and forest management, but lack executive and judicial powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule, while stemming from the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) but only in the specific states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It does not apply to all states with significant tribal populations. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess a significant degree of autonomy, including not only legislative powers but also executive and judicial powers over specified areas. They have the authority to make laws, collect taxes, manage resources, and administer justice within their respective jurisdictions.  Therefore, neither statement provides a completely accurate depiction of the Sixth Schedule's provisions.


**11. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 3 of the Constitution empowers the Parliament to form new states by separating territory from any existing state, but only with the prior approval of the state government concerned.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in either House of Parliament only on the recommendation of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 3 does empower Parliament to form new states by various means (including separating territory from existing ones), it does *not* require the prior approval of the state government concerned.  The process involves a parliamentary procedure, and while consultation may occur, the final decision rests with the Parliament. Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament on the recommendation of the President.  This requirement underscores the importance of executive input in such a significant constitutional matter. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional provisions.


**12. With reference to sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's ruling in *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh & Others* permits sub-classification of Scheduled Castes to create separate quotas for more backward groups within the SC categories, based on the principle of substantive equality.
2.  Sub-classification within Scheduled Castes requires demonstrating inadequacy of representation in all sectors, including the private sector, and must be based solely on backwardness and not political expediency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the Supreme Court's decision in *State of Punjab & Others v. Davinder Singh & Others*. The court did permit sub-classification within Scheduled Castes to address varying degrees of backwardness within these groups, aiming to achieve substantive equality by providing targeted affirmative action.  This is based on the understanding that Scheduled Castes are not a homogenous group. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While demonstrating inadequacy of representation is crucial for justifying sub-classification, the focus in the Supreme Court's judgment was primarily on inadequacy of representation in "services of the State."  The requirement is to establish backwardness as the primary basis for sub-classification, but the court also acknowledged that such decisions must be subject to judicial review to prevent political manipulation. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**13. With reference to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 44 of the Constitution directs the state to endeavor to secure for the citizens a UCC throughout the territory of India, covering matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption.
2.  The current personal laws in India are uniform across all religions, with a single code governing matters related to marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption for all citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly states that Article 44 of the Constitution of India directs the state to strive towards the implementation of a Uniform Civil Code (UCC) throughout the country. This article, located in the Directive Principles of State Policy, emphasizes the goal of establishing a single system of personal laws applicable to all citizens, irrespective of their religious affiliations.  The scope of the UCC would extend to various personal matters, including marriage, divorce, inheritance, and adoption. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The present legal system in India does *not* feature a uniform civil code.  Different personal laws govern different religious communities.  For example, Hindus are governed by the Hindu Succession Act, Muslims by Muslim Personal Law, and so on.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**14. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act mandates that the religious character of a place of worship shall remain as it was on August 15, 1947, except in cases where a court order had already altered the character before that date.
2.  The recent Supreme Court order bars civil courts from registering new suits challenging the ownership of places of worship or ordering surveys of disputed religious sites, irrespective of whether these disputes existed before or after 1947.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key provision of the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991.  The Act aims to maintain the status quo regarding the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947, unless a court order had already modified it before that date. This aims to prevent future disputes based on religious identity. Statement 2 also correctly describes the Supreme Court's recent order. The court's decision temporarily prevents new legal challenges to the ownership of places of worship and prohibits surveys of disputed sites, irrespective of when the disputes originated.  This aims to maintain peace and prevent further communal tensions.  Both statements reflect the legal framework and recent judicial pronouncements regarding places of worship.


**15. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments, established by the East India Company, are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.
2. The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, relating to urban local bodies, does not apply to cantonment boards, as the local self-government of cantonments is a matter solely under the Union government's jurisdiction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonments were established by the East India Company and are currently administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006.  They are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, reflecting their strategic importance. Statement 2 is also correct.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies, does not apply to cantonment boards.  The administration of cantonments falls under Entry 3 of the Union List, placing it solely within the Union government's jurisdiction.  This distinguishes cantonment administration from that of other urban local bodies governed by state laws.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the unique administrative position of cantonment boards.


**16. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following statements:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a fundamental right under Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* broadened the scope of fundamental rights, particularly Article 21 (right to life), to encompass environmental protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the Supreme Court's approach to environmental issues and its interpretation of fundamental rights. Statement 1 correctly describes the court's recognition of a right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. While not explicitly stated as a separate right, the court linked this to the existing rights guaranteed under Articles 14 (equality) and 21 (right to life). Statement 2 accurately identifies the case (*M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others*) and highlights the court's use of judicial review to expand the scope of fundamental rights to include environmental concerns.  This demonstrates the judiciary's role in evolving the interpretation of fundamental rights to address contemporary challenges.  Therefore, both statements are correct and reflect the evolving legal landscape regarding environmental protection and fundamental rights.


**17. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, aims to involve elected representatives, government officials, and community-based organizations in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan employs a thematic approach based on localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), utilizing the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify development gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's core objective.  The initiative actively seeks inclusive participation in the preparation of PDPs, involving elected representatives at all three tiers of Panchayats, government frontline workers, and community-based organizations like Self Help Groups (SHGs).  This participatory approach aims to ensure that PDPs are grounded in local needs and priorities. Statement 2 also correctly highlights the campaign's thematic approach.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan adopts a localized version of the SDGs, using the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to assess the overall development of Panchayats and identify areas requiring attention. This data-driven approach helps in prioritizing development efforts based on specific needs.  Therefore, both statements are correct and reflect the key features of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.


**18. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Gujarat, aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies and promote best practices in financial management.
2.  iCAL's establishment marks the first such dedicated center in India, focusing solely on the auditing of local bodies and excluding the audit of other governmental entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the purpose of the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL).  The center aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, promoting best practices in financial management and accountability. This is crucial for improving the efficiency and transparency of local governments.  Statement 2, however, is an oversimplification. While iCAL is indeed the first of its kind in India, focusing primarily on local bodies, it's not entirely exclusive of auditing other governmental entities.  Its scope might extend to related areas or collaborations depending on its evolving mandate.   Therefore, only statement 1 provides a completely accurate description of iCAL's primary function.



**1. With reference to Indian Passports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Government can exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement.
2.  Only citizens of India are eligible to receive Indian passports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Central government possesses the authority to grant exemptions from passport requirements for specific individuals, as dictated by its discretion. This provision acknowledges potential exceptions to the general rule, allowing for flexibility in circumstances where a passport may not be strictly necessary.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the majority of passport holders are Indian citizens, the Central Government retains the power to issue passports to non-citizens if deemed in the public interest. This provision allows for exceptions based on national security or other considerations deemed crucial by the government.  The issuance of passports is not solely restricted to Indian citizens.  This demonstrates a nuanced approach to passport issuance, balancing national interests with broader considerations.


**2. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are exclusively designed to deliver government services to rural areas.
2.  CSCs operate under the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSCs significantly cater to rural areas, their service delivery extends to both urban and rural populations.  They provide a broad spectrum of services, including government, private, and social sector offerings, making them a versatile platform for citizen engagement beyond just rural areas.  The pan-India network demonstrates a commitment to national reach, not just rural focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSCs are overseen by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This highlights the technological and digital infrastructure focus of the CSC scheme, aligning it with the broader national e-governance strategy.  The ministry's involvement underscores the importance of technology in bridging the digital divide and facilitating service delivery across India.


**3. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The WPFI 2024 ranked India among the top 50 countries globally.
2.  The WPFI is published by UNESCO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 was significantly lower than the top 50, reflecting concerns about press freedom in the country. The lower ranking highlights challenges and issues related to media independence and freedom of expression within the Indian context.  This underscores the importance of addressing these issues to improve India's global standing on press freedom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPFI is published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not UNESCO. RSF's role as a leading NGO in defending and promoting freedom of information gives the index significant weight in global discourse on press freedom.  The distinction highlights the specific organizational focus and expertise of RSF in this area.


**4.  With reference to the powers of the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The DGPS has the authority to determine postal rates but not the sale of postage stamps.
2. The DGPS can regulate the supply and sale of postage stamps but lacks authority over postal charges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The DGPS, as per the Post Office Act 2023, has the power to make regulations concerning both charges for services *and* the supply and sale of postage stamps. This comprehensive authority reflects the DGPS's overarching role in managing the postal system's operations and revenue generation. The combined authority underlines the centralized control over pricing and stamp distribution within the Indian postal system.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) accreditation, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC's accreditation was revoked by GANHRI in 2023.
2. The NHRC's 'A' status accreditation was initially granted in 2017.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHRC's accreditation was *deferred*, not revoked, by GANHRI in 2023.  The deferral indicates a temporary suspension, highlighting areas needing improvement, rather than a complete withdrawal of accreditation.  The distinction between deferral and revocation is crucial in understanding the status of the NHRC's accreditation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC first received 'A' status accreditation in 1999.  The 2017 accreditation was a renewal or reaffirmation after a period of deferral, not the initial grant of 'A' status.  The timeline is essential for accurately understanding the history of the NHRC's accreditation.


**6. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act applies to personal data processed outside India if it relates to offering goods or services within India.
2. The Act explicitly covers personal data processed for personal purposes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DPDP Act 2023 has extraterritorial reach, extending its application to personal data processed outside India if the processing is linked to offering goods or services within the country. This demonstrates the Act's intent to safeguard Indian citizens' data even when processed internationally. The extraterritorial aspect expands the scope of data protection beyond India's geographical boundaries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly *excludes* personal data processed for personal purposes. This exemption recognizes that the Act is primarily concerned with regulating data processing for commercial or governmental purposes rather than personal use. The exclusion clarifies the Act’s focus, limiting its application to specific contexts.


**7.  With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006,  in accordance with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
2. The Station Commander of a Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with local self-government, not the 73rd Amendment Act (which deals with Panchayats).  The specific amendment is crucial in understanding the constitutional basis for Cantonment administration.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a Cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This reflects the military's significant role in the governance and administration of cantonments.  The ex-officio presidency demonstrates the integration of military and civil administration within cantonments.


**8. With reference to the Supreme Court's judgment on climate change, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court ruled that the right to a healthy environment is a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution.
2. The judgment was delivered in a case concerning the protection of the Great Indian Bustard.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from adverse effects of climate change to the fundamental right to life (Article 21) and the right to equality (Article 14). This landmark ruling significantly expands the scope of environmental protection under the Constitution. The expansion of fundamental rights to include environmental protection is a significant development in Indian constitutional law.

Statement 2 is correct. The judgment was indeed delivered in the case of *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others*, which focused on the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.  The context of the case illustrates the Court's application of the principle to a specific environmental issue. The case highlights the Court's proactive role in environmental protection.


**9. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution.
2. The NCSC's powers include inquiring into complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCSC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Civil Rights Act, 1955, and not a constitutional body under Part IX. The distinction between statutory and constitutional bodies is crucial in understanding its legal basis.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC has the power to inquire into complaints regarding atrocities against Scheduled Castes. This is a core function of the commission, highlighting its role in safeguarding the rights of this vulnerable community.  This power is essential for addressing discrimination and ensuring justice for Scheduled Castes.


**10. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for all central government services.
2. The UPSC's recommendations for appointments are binding on the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC conducts examinations for most, but not all, central government services.  While it's a primary recruitment body, there are some exceptions where other agencies may be involved. The UPSC's role is central to the process of recruiting qualified candidates for the civil services.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UPSC's recommendations for appointments are advisory, not binding, on the government. The government retains the ultimate authority in making appointments, even though it typically follows the UPSC's recommendations.  This advisory role highlights the balance between the UPSC's expertise and the government's final decision-making power.


**11. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is legally binding and its violation is a criminal offence.
2. The MCC applies only to political parties and their candidates.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is a set of guidelines, not a legally binding statute.  While violations can lead to actions under other laws (like the Representation of the People Act), the MCC itself does not carry criminal penalties.  The distinction between guidelines and legally binding rules is crucial for understanding its enforcement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC applies to political parties, their candidates, polling agents, the government in power, and government employees during the election period. Its scope extends beyond just political parties and candidates to ensure a fair election process for all stakeholders. The broader applicability demonstrates the MCC's aim to maintain a level playing field during elections.


**12. With reference to Lok Sabha Elections, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Sabha elections are conducted on the basis of proportional representation.
2. Each Lok Sabha constituency elects only one representative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of territorial representation, not proportional representation.  In territorial representation, each constituency elects a single representative, unlike proportional representation where seats are allocated based on the proportion of votes received. The difference in electoral systems is fundamental to understanding the representation structure.

Statement 2 is correct. Each Lok Sabha constituency is a single-member constituency, meaning only one representative is elected from each constituency. This "first-past-the-post" system is a key feature of the Indian electoral system.  The single-member constituency system directly relates to the principle of territorial representation.


**13. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched by the Ministry of Rural Development.
2. The Abhiyan focuses solely on preparing Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People's Plan Campaign, was launched by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. The distinction between the two ministries is important for understanding the campaign's focus on local governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GPDPs are a core component, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's scope extends to preparing development plans at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).  The multi-tiered approach is crucial to its comprehensive nature.  The broader scope demonstrates the campaign's aim for holistic development planning.


**14. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is located in Bengaluru.
2. iCAL aims to establish international standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is located in Rajkot, Gujarat, not Bengaluru. The location highlights the initiative's focus on a specific region of India initially.

Statement 2 is correct. iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, indicating a focus on best practices and international collaboration. The global standard-setting is key to its aspirational goals. The international focus signifies the importance of sharing best practices in local governance auditing.


**15. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1. NGOs must obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds, but Aadhaar submission is not mandatory.
2.  The FCRA permits the use of foreign contributions for any purpose, irrespective of the original intent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under the amended FCRA, prior permission and Aadhaar submission for office-bearers are both mandatory requirements for NGOs receiving foreign funds.  The mandatory Aadhaar requirement adds a layer of verification and accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FCRA restricts the use of foreign funds to the specific purpose for which they were received, with a limited percentage allowed for administrative expenses.  The restriction ensures that funds are used as intended, maintaining transparency and accountability.  The limitations on fund usage are essential for preventing misuse of foreign contributions.


**16. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Protected Area.
2. Foreigners require special permits to visit Restricted Areas, with exceptions for Bhutanese citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is partly a Protected Area and partly a Restricted Area.  The division between Protected and Restricted Areas reflects different levels of access restrictions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Foreigners, excluding Bhutanese citizens, need special permits to enter Restricted Areas in India.  The exemption for Bhutanese citizens reflects specific bilateral arrangements.  The permit requirement underscores the security and access control measures in place for these sensitive areas.


**17. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and States based on Article 245.
2. Taxes levied and collected by the Centre, but wholly assigned to States, are governed by Article 268.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and States based on Article 246, not Article 245. Article 245 deals with the extent of laws made by Parliament and state legislatures.  The correct Article number is crucial for understanding the constitutional basis of fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 268 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to the States. This is a key aspect of revenue sharing between the Union and States.  The Article clarifies the revenue distribution mechanism.


**1. With reference to the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), consider the following statements:**

1. The RTBF, originating from French jurisprudence's "right to oblivion," is an absolute right.
2. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 explicitly incorporates the "right to be forgotten."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), while rooted in the French concept of "right to oblivion," is *not* an absolute right.  Its application is subject to various limitations and balancing tests, considering factors like public interest and freedom of expression. Courts often weigh the individual's right to privacy against other competing rights and societal interests before granting an RTBF request.  The Puttaswamy judgment recognized it as part of Article 21, but this doesn't imply absolute enforceability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023,  a significant piece of legislation concerning data protection in India, notably *does not* explicitly mention or provide for a "right to be forgotten."  This contrasts with the approach taken by regulations like the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which explicitly includes such a right. The absence of an RTBF provision in the Indian Act reflects a deliberate policy choice, potentially prioritizing other aspects of data privacy and balancing competing interests.  The Indian legislature might address this issue in future amendments, but currently, no such right exists within the DPDP Act.


**2. With reference to Inner Line Permits (ILPs), consider the following statements:**

1.  ILPs are issued only to non-Indian citizens seeking entry into protected areas for tourism purposes.
2.  Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, Manipur, and Tripura are the states currently under the ILP system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ILPs are issued to Indian citizens, not exclusively non-Indian citizens.  Their purpose is to regulate the entry of individuals into protected areas, often for reasons of preserving tribal cultures and managing populations near international borders. While tourism is one reason for applying, ILPs also cater to other purposes, including long-term stays for employment.  The permit system distinguishes between different types of permits based on the duration and purpose of the visit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Manipur are currently under the ILP system, Tripura is *not*. The inclusion of states under ILP is a matter of government policy and can change over time.  The ILP system aims to protect the unique culture and identity of the tribal communities in these designated areas.  The extension or exclusion of states from the ILP system is subject to political and administrative considerations.


**3. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas Permits (PAP/RAP), consider the following statements:**

1.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958.
2.  Bhutanese citizens require special permits to enter Protected or Restricted Areas in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is *partially* designated as a Protected Area and partially as a Restricted Area under the relevant orders. The division reflects different levels of access control and regulatory measures in place.  The precise demarcation within Sikkim is a matter of specific government regulations and may involve intricate geographical delineations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, and the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, specifically exempt Bhutanese citizens from the requirement of obtaining special permits. This exemption reflects the special relationship and border agreements between India and Bhutan.  The exemption is an exception to the general rule concerning the need for permits for foreigners visiting Protected or Restricted Areas in India.


**4. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 50% share of divisible pool revenue for states.
2.  Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool revenue for states, not 50%.  This figure represents the proportion of tax revenues collected by the central government that are devolved to state governments. The precise percentage is a key aspect of fiscal federalism and is subject to periodic review and revision by the Finance Commission.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Indian Constitution explicitly empowers the central government to provide grants-in-aid to states. This constitutional provision is crucial for ensuring financial equity and assisting states with specific developmental needs or financial constraints.  The allocation of grants-in-aid is often guided by the recommendations of the Finance Commission, but the power to provide them is constitutionally vested in the central government.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  SCS is granted to states based solely on their geographical disadvantages.
2.  The criteria for granting SCS are determined by the Planning Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The grant of Special Category Status (SCS) to states is not based solely on geographical disadvantages. While geographical factors play a role, the assessment also considers socio-economic factors such as low population density, hilly or difficult terrain, strategic importance, and economic backwardness.  It's a multi-faceted assessment aimed at identifying states needing special assistance for development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The criteria for granting SCS are not determined by the Planning Commission (which has been replaced by NITI Aayog).  The initial introduction of SCS was based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, and subsequent grants have been guided by various factors and not just by a single body.  The process involves a complex evaluation considering various socio-economic and geographical indicators.  The decision to grant SCS remains within the purview of the central government.


**6. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President can grant pardons only for offences against laws relating to matters within the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President's power extends to commuting death sentences passed by courts-martial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 72 of the Constitution of India explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This power is not unlimited and is confined to specific legal contexts.

Statement 2 is also correct. Article 72 expressly includes the President's power to commute death sentences passed by courts-martial. Courts-martial are military tribunals, and the President's power extends to their judgments, reflecting the unique nature of military justice systems.  This power is a significant aspect of the President's role as the Supreme Commander of the armed forces.


**7. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition is a remedy available after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain curative petitions stems from Article 136 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the final and last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court of India. This remedy is exceptional and is available only under very limited circumstances where there has been a gross miscarriage of justice.  It is meant to address situations where the review process itself may have been flawed or failed to address fundamental issues of justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions doesn't derive from Article 136 but from Article 142 of the Constitution. Article 142 grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice, and this inherent power has been interpreted to encompass the ability to hear curative petitions in exceptional cases.  Article 136 deals with the Court's appellate jurisdiction, while Article 142 relates to the Court's inherent powers to ensure justice.


**8. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments.
2.  FTSCs primarily handle cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are funded under a centrally sponsored scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund. While states play a role in implementation, the primary funding comes from the central government.  This reflects the national importance of addressing sexual violence and crimes against children.

Statement 2 is correct. FTSCs were specifically established to ensure the swift disposal of rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act.  These courts are designed to handle these sensitive cases with a focus on efficiency and timeliness, aiming to reduce the backlog of cases and provide faster justice to victims.  The focus on POCSO cases underlines the importance of protecting children from sexual abuse and ensuring timely prosecution of offenders.


**9. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are applicable to all states in India.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, while establishing Gram Nyayalayas, has specific exemptions for certain states, including Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, and specified tribal areas.  The applicability of the Act is not uniform across all states and union territories.  The exemptions reflect regional variations in legal and administrative systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the stringent rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They are guided by the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution at the village level. This flexibility is intended to make the justice system more accessible and less formal in rural areas.


**10. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Only the Supreme Court has the power to punish for contempt of court.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order or breach of an undertaking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have the power to punish for contempt of court.  This power is inherent in their judicial function and is necessary to maintain the authority and integrity of the judicial system.  Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant this power to the Supreme Court and High Courts respectively.

Statement 2 is correct.  Civil contempt is defined as the willful disobedience of any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or other process of a court, or the willful breach of an undertaking given to a court.  It focuses on the defiance of specific court orders or commitments.  The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is an important aspect of contempt law.


**11. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is the first centre of its kind in the world, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance.
2. iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of local governance bodies in India and across the globe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is the first such centre in *India*, not the world.  While it aims to set high standards for auditing local governance, similar institutions or initiatives exist in other parts of the world.  The claim of being the first globally is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL's primary focus is not on directly conducting audits but on capacity building, knowledge sharing, and setting standards.  It acts as a collaborative platform, a center of excellence, and a think tank to improve the quality of auditing local governance bodies.  It works to enhance the independence and effectiveness of local government auditors.


**12. With reference to the AuditOnline application, consider the following statements:**

1. AuditOnline is an application for conducting online audits of only urban local body accounts.
2. AuditOnline was awarded the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AuditOnline is designed for online audits of both panchayat and urban local body accounts. Its purpose is to improve transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds at the grassroots level. The application covers both rural and urban local governance bodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AuditOnline application developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj did indeed receive the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023 at the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva.  This award recognizes its contribution to improving governance through the use of technology.


**13. With reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA), 2019, and its associated rules, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA, 2019, provides a path to Indian citizenship for all religious minorities from neighboring countries who entered India before January 1, 1966.
2.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, require applicants for citizenship by naturalization to demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of all languages listed in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, provides a path to citizenship for religious minorities (excluding Muslims) from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan who have entered India before a specific cut-off date (which is not January 1, 1966, but a later date specified in the Act). The Act is not applicable to all religious minorities from all neighboring countries and has a specific cut-off date.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, do not require applicants for citizenship to demonstrate knowledge of *all* languages in the 8th Schedule.  The requirement is for adequate knowledge of *one* of the languages listed in the 8th Schedule.  This is a crucial detail that distinguishes the actual requirement from the statement.


**14. With reference to Foreigners' Tribunals, consider the following statements:**

1. Foreigners' Tribunals are established under the Foreigners Act, 1946, and have the sole authority to declare a person a foreigner.
2.  A person's exclusion from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) automatically classifies them as a foreigner.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Foreigners' Tribunals, established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946, have the exclusive authority to declare a person a foreigner. This power is a crucial aspect of the legal framework for determining citizenship status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exclusion from the NRC does not automatically classify a person as a foreigner.  It is merely one factor that may be considered in proceedings before a Foreigners' Tribunal.  The Tribunal's decision is based on a comprehensive evaluation of evidence, not solely on NRC inclusion or exclusion.  The NRC is a process for identifying citizens, but its outcome is not the final determination of citizenship status.


**15. With reference to the Indian Postal Department and the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, grants the Director General of Posts (DGPS) the power to regulate the charges for services related to the supply and sale of postage stamps.
2. The Act prescribes stringent penal provisions for any breaches of postal regulations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, indeed empowers the Director General of Posts (DGPS) to make regulations on matters concerning charges for services, including the supply and sale of postage stamps. This power is essential for the efficient administration and financial management of the postal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, does *not* prescribe stringent penal provisions.  The Act has limited penal provisions focusing on specific offenses with relatively minor penalties.  The focus is more on administrative measures and regulations rather than severe criminal penalties.


**16. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and its accreditation, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC's accreditation is assessed by the United Nations Human Rights Council.
2. The NHRC was first granted 'A' status accreditation in 2006.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC's accreditation is assessed by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI), a UN-linked organization, but not directly by the UN Human Rights Council. GANHRI's accreditation process is a significant benchmark for national human rights institutions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC was first granted 'A' status accreditation in 1999, not 2006. The year 1999 marks a significant milestone in the recognition of the NHRC's work and its adherence to international standards.  The subsequent deferral and regaining of accreditation highlight the continuous assessment and monitoring of the NHRC's performance.



**1. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPBI's decisions are appealable to the Supreme Court of India.
2.  Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a data breach, but not necessarily to erase personal data once the purpose of processing is met.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against DPBI decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's jurisdiction in this matter is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.  This is a crucial distinction for understanding the appellate process within the Indian data protection framework. The question plays on the common misconception that the Supreme Court handles all appeals related to government bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. Data fiduciaries are explicitly required to inform the DPBI and affected persons about data breaches. However, while they *must* erase personal data when the purpose is met and retention isn't legally necessary, this is presented as a separate obligation and doesn't negate the data breach notification requirement. The statement subtly shifts the focus from the "erasure" obligation to incorrectly imply a connection between notification and erasure.


**2. With reference to the rights and duties of Data Principals under the data protection framework, consider the following statements:**

1. Data principals have the right to demand the complete destruction of their personal data regardless of legal requirements.
2.  A penalty of up to Rs. 5,000 is imposed for registering a false or frivolous complaint.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Data principals have the right to seek correction and erasure of their personal data, but this is not absolute.  Legal requirements for data retention can override this right.  The statement overstates the power of the data principal, creating a plausible but incorrect option.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The penalty for registering a false or frivolous complaint or providing false information is up to Rs. 10,000, not Rs. 5,000. This subtle numerical difference acts as a significant distractor, testing the examinee's precise recall of information.  The option uses a close but incorrect figure to confuse the test taker.


**3. With reference to Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs), consider the following statements:**

1. The designation of an SDF is solely based on the volume of personal data processed.
2.  SDFs are required to appoint a data protection officer but not an independent data auditor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the volume of personal data is a factor in determining SDF status, the designation also considers sensitivity of data, risk to data principal rights, potential impact on India's sovereignty and integrity, state security, risk to electoral democracy, and public order. The statement simplifies the complex criteria for SDF designation, making it an attractive but incorrect option.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SDFs are required to appoint both a data protection officer and an independent data auditor. The statement omits a key requirement for SDFs, making it a plausible yet incorrect option that tests the candidate's thorough understanding of SDF obligations.


**4. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).
2.  The campaign's thematic approach is based on a localized interpretation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GPDPs are a central component, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan encompasses the preparation of plans at all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District).  The statement narrows the scope of the campaign to mislead the candidate.

Statement 2 is correct. The campaign explicitly uses a thematic approach based on localized SDGs and a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach." This accurately reflects a key aspect of the campaign's implementation strategy.


**5. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is responsible for conducting the audits of all local bodies in India.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the proper maintenance of accounts and auditing for all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL aims to set global standards and build capacity for auditing local governance, but it doesn't directly conduct audits of all local bodies in India.  The statement exaggerates iCAL's role to create a deceptive option.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's mandate, derived from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, explicitly covers the audit of all three levels of PRIs and ULBs.  This is a factual statement reflecting the CAG's constitutional role.


**6. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a constitutional body established under the Indian Constitution.
2. The selection panel for the CBI Director comprises the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in Lok Sabha, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is a non-statutory and non-constitutional body, governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946.  The statement incorrectly classifies the CBI's constitutional status.

Statement 2 is correct. The composition of the selection panel for the CBI Director accurately reflects the given information.


**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are primarily funded through the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The funding pattern for core CSSs in the North Eastern States and Himalayan States is 50:50 between the Centre and the States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  All transfers to States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.  The statement incorrectly identifies the source of funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding pattern for core schemes in 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States is 90:10 (Centre:State), not 50:50. This is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's ability to recall precise figures.


**8. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi is solely focused on the training and capacity building of officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is the shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi covers all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments of the Union Government; it is not limited to IAS officers.  The statement restricts the scope of Mission Karmayogi to create a misleading option.

Statement 2 is correct.  The shift from rule-based to role-based training is a core principle of Mission Karmayogi.


**9. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS for all states that previously held it.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't have a provision for categorizing states as SCS states; it's a policy decision.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional basis (or lack thereof) for SCS.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS, leading to its abolition.  The statement presents a false claim about the Finance Commission's recommendations.


**10. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can grant a pardon only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., is derived from Article 73 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's power extends to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial or for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, *or* a death sentence. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the President's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President's power on mercy petitions is derived from Article 72, not Article 73.  Article 73 deals with the extent of the executive power of the Union.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific constitutional articles.


**11. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to entertain a curative petition is derived from its inherent powers under Article 142.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is filed after the dismissal of a review petition, not a writ petition, by the Supreme Court.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the procedural aspects of curative petitions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain a curative petition stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 to do complete justice.


**12. With reference to the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are funded entirely by the state governments.
2.  FTSCs were primarily established to handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, funded by the Centre from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The statement incorrectly attributes funding to state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While FTSCs handle POCSO cases, their primary objective is to ensure the swift disposal of *both* rape cases and POCSO cases. The statement oversimplifies the scope of FTSCs' jurisdiction.


**13. With reference to the devolution of taxes between the Union and States, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the states to the Union and other states.
2.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of taxes among states based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the *Union* to the Union and the States, not the other way around. The statement reverses the flow of tax distribution.

Statement 2 is correct. Horizontal devolution accurately describes the distribution of the states' share of taxes among the states based on various criteria recommended by the Finance Commission.


**14. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule applies to all the states in Northeast India.
2.  The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule applies to specific areas within four states in Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram), not all states in the region.  The statement incorrectly broadens the geographical scope of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule was indeed incorporated based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.


**15. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee consists of members from both Houses of Parliament in equal numbers.
2. The Estimates Committee primarily focuses on examining whether the money allocated to various government schemes has been utilized efficiently.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee has more members from the Lok Sabha (15) than the Rajya Sabha (7).  The statement incorrectly represents the proportional composition of the committee.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Estimates Committee's mandate includes examining the efficiency of government spending.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only for offenses against laws relating to matters where the Union's executive power extends.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial, but not to cases where the sentence is awarded by a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial *or* for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  It's not limited to only one category. The scope is broader than what statement 1 suggests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72 clearly encompasses cases where sentences are awarded by court-martials.  It also extends to sentences awarded by civil courts, including death sentences.  The President's power is not restricted to only court-martial cases.  The power is comprehensive, encompassing various judicial pronouncements.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court and is the final remedy available.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142, and the grounds for filing such a petition include allegations of violation of principles of natural justice or apprehension of bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition under Article 137. It represents the final avenue for seeking redressal within the constitutional framework.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's authority to entertain curative petitions is derived from its inherent powers under Article 142, which allows it to do complete justice.  The grounds for filing such a petition include demonstrating a violation of principles of natural justice, a failure by a judge to disclose a conflict of interest, or a credible apprehension of bias that significantly affected the judgment.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were launched as a centrally sponsored scheme in 2019, funded entirely by state governments, aiming to expedite the disposal of rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act.
2. The implementation of FTSCs is overseen by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored* scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure, not entirely funded by state governments. Second, while the primary aim is to expedite rape and POCSO Act cases, it is not exclusively limited to these; other cases may also be fast-tracked depending on the court's workload and prioritization.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The implementation of FTSCs falls under the purview of the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development.  While the latter ministry has a crucial role in addressing women's and children's rights, the logistical and administrative aspects of the FTSCs are handled by the Department of Justice.


**4. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that all data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor, regardless of the volume or sensitivity of data processed.
2. Appeals against decisions of the Data Protection Board of India lie with the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act does not mandate that *all* data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor.  This requirement is primarily for Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs), which are those handling large volumes of sensitive personal data and posing significant risks.  Smaller entities may have different compliance requirements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against the decisions of the Data Protection Board of India lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  The TDSAT is a specialized tribunal dealing with telecommunications and related disputes, providing a specialized appellate mechanism for data protection matters.


**5. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2023, aims to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26 with a focus on achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is used to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat level, and the approved Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does aim to prepare PDPs for 2025-26 and utilizes a thematic approach based on localized SDGs, it was launched in 2018 (as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas'), not 2023.  The 2023 news refers to its renewed implementation for the 2025-26 plans.

Statement 2 is correct. The PDI is indeed a key tool for identifying thematic gaps, and the approved GPDPs are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal to ensure transparency and accountability in the planning process.  This ensures that plans are publicly available and accessible.


**6. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) conducts audits of local bodies through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level, but only for funds directly allocated by the central government.
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies extends to funds granted by *both* the central and state governments. The ELFA/DLFA, working under the CAG's supervision, audit the utilization of funds from all sources, not just central government allocations.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a significant initiative aimed at improving the efficiency and transparency of the auditing process for panchayat accounts.  It enables online auditing, promoting better accountability and utilization of funds at the grassroots level.


**7. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and mandates that all evidence must be presented in electronic or digital format.
2. The Act introduces provisions for joint trials, where multiple accused can be tried simultaneously, even if one has absconded.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, it does *not* mandate that all evidence must be presented electronically. While it allows for electronic evidence and oral evidence to be given electronically, it doesn't eliminate the admissibility of other forms of evidence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act does introduce provisions for joint trials, facilitating the simultaneous trial of multiple accused, even if one or more have absconded.  This aims to improve the efficiency of the judicial process in certain cases.


**8. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly categorizes certain states as Special Category States, providing them with special financial provisions.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS category, and currently, special financial assistance to Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on recommendations outside the SCS framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly categorize states as SCS. The SCS status was a policy decision based on various factors like geographical location, socio-economic conditions, and developmental challenges.  This was a post-constitutional development.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations resulted in the discontinuation of the SCS category.  The current special financial assistance to certain states is based on different criteria and recommendations, often stemming from specific needs assessments and proposals rather than the earlier SCS categorization.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in the state of Assam only.
2. The Sixth Schedule aims to safeguard the cultural identity and autonomy of tribal communities in certain areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule's provisions are primarily applied in Assam, it is not limited to Assam alone. It applies to certain areas in four states—Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram—allowing for the establishment of autonomous district councils in these specified regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule's primary aim is indeed to safeguard the cultural identity, autonomy, and administrative control of tribal communities in the specified areas.  This is a crucial aspect of India's constitutional framework for protecting the rights of its indigenous populations.


**10. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and established the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, coordinates the implementation of the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, it did *not* explicitly establish the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19.  The Supreme Court's interpretation in cases like *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* has recognized aspects related to information access under Article 19, but the RTI Act itself doesn't explicitly declare it a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions plays a key role in coordinating the implementation of the RTI Act.  This includes overseeing various aspects of its operation and addressing related issues.


**11. With reference to the issuance of passports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports in India is governed by the Passport Act of 1920, with no subsequent amendments.
2.  Only citizens of India are eligible to apply for passports in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Passport Act, while foundational, has been amended several times since 1920 to adapt to evolving circumstances and technological advancements. The current regulations reflect these amendments.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While most passport holders are Indian citizens, the Central Government does have the power to issue passports to non-citizens in specific circumstances deemed to be in the public interest.  This is an exception to the general rule.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs):**

1. The People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan) aims to solely enhance the role of elected representatives in Panchayat Development Plan (PDP) preparation.
2. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is a multi-domain index used to assess the financial performance of panchayats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While elected representatives play a crucial role, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan emphasizes broader participation, including frontline workers, community-based organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders.  The aim is to accelerate *people's* participation, not just elected representatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PDI assesses the overall holistic *development, performance, and progress* of panchayats across multiple sectors, not just their financial performance.  It's a multi-sectoral, not solely financial, index. The focus is on a comprehensive evaluation of development rather than a narrow financial assessment. The PDI considers various social, economic, and infrastructure aspects to provide a holistic view of panchayat development.


**2. With reference to the Rajya Sabha, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee of Privileges of the Rajya Sabha consists of members nominated by the Prime Minister.
2. The Rajya Sabha's Committee on Official Languages submits its recommendations to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The members of the Rajya Sabha's Committee of Privileges are nominated by the *Chairman* of the Rajya Sabha, not the Prime Minister.  The Prime Minister does not have a direct role in the composition of this committee. The Chairman's role ensures the committee's independence and impartiality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha's Committee on Official Languages submits its recommendations to the *President* of India, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha. The President, as the head of state, receives these recommendations concerning the use of Hindi for official purposes.  The Lok Sabha Speaker's role is confined to the lower house.


**3. With reference to the Union Cabinet Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Cabinet Committees are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2.  All Cabinet Committees are chaired exclusively by Cabinet Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cabinet Committees are *extra-constitutional* bodies; their establishment is governed by the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, not the Constitution itself. The Constitution doesn't detail the structure or functioning of these committees.  Their existence is a matter of convention and established practice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While most Cabinet Committees are chaired by Cabinet Ministers (often the Prime Minister for key committees), the rules do not *exclusively* restrict chairmanship to Cabinet Ministers.  The possibility of non-Cabinet Ministers chairing certain committees, although rare, isn't constitutionally or procedurally forbidden.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC):**

1. The Election Commission of India (ECI) derives its authority to enforce the MCC from a specific article in the Constitution explicitly mentioning the MCC.
2. Violations of the MCC are directly prosecutable under the Indian Penal Code.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ECI's authority to oversee elections stems from Article 324, which grants it the power of superintendence, direction, and control of elections. However, the Constitution does *not* explicitly mention the MCC. The MCC is a set of guidelines, not a constitutional provision. The MCC's legal basis rests on the ECI's constitutional authority to conduct free and fair elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Because the MCC lacks statutory backing, its violations are not directly prosecutable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  However, violations can be addressed through provisions in other statutes like the Representation of the People Act, 1951 (RPA), which covers corrupt practices during elections.  The MCC's enforcement relies on the ECI's powers and other relevant laws.


**5. With reference to Lok Sabha Elections, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Sabha elections utilize a system of proportional representation, ensuring each party's representation in the legislature aligns with its vote share.
2.  In a single-member constituency, the candidate securing the highest number of votes is declared elected, regardless of whether they secure an absolute majority.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Sabha elections employ a system of *territorial representation* using the "first-past-the-post" method, not proportional representation.  Proportional representation would ensure that a party's seats in the Lok Sabha are directly proportional to their share of the national vote.  The current system doesn't guarantee this.

Statement 2 is correct. In a single-member constituency, the candidate with the highest number of votes wins, even if they don't obtain an absolute majority (more than 50% of the votes cast).  The system focuses on winning the most votes within the constituency, not necessarily achieving a majority.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2.  The Tribes Advisory Councils (TACs) established under the Fifth Schedule have more extensive powers than the ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule specifically applies to the four northeastern states mentioned: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, granting the Governor the power to establish ADCs and ARCs within these states' designated areas.  The scope of the Sixth Schedule is limited to these specific regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule have significantly *more extensive powers* than the TACs under the Fifth Schedule.  ADCs and ARCs possess legislative, executive, and even some judicial powers within their jurisdictions, while TACs primarily play an advisory role. The Sixth Schedule provides for a far greater degree of autonomy.


**7. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The power to form new states rests solely with the President of India, who can exercise this power without parliamentary intervention.
2.  Any bill for the formation of a new state must be introduced in Parliament only with the President's recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President plays a crucial role, the power to form new states rests with *Parliament*, not solely with the President.  Parliament, through a law, can create new states by altering boundaries, uniting territories, or separating parts of existing states. The President's role is to assent to the parliamentary legislation.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 of the Constitution explicitly mandates that any bill concerning the formation of new states or alteration of existing ones must be introduced in Parliament *only* on the President's recommendation.  This ensures that the President's view is considered before such significant constitutional changes are undertaken.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding sub-classification of Scheduled Castes (SCs):**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that sub-classification of SCs is permissible only if it is based on economic backwardness.
2.  Article 341(2) of the Constitution explicitly prohibits sub-classification within the existing list of Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's ruling allows for sub-classification of SCs based on the *inadequate representation* of certain castes within the SC category, which might be due to their backwardness, but it's not solely based on economic backwardness.  Other factors related to social and historical disadvantages can also be considered. The court emphasized substantive equality, not just economic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 341(2) empowers Parliament to *include or exclude* castes from the SC list but doesn't explicitly prohibit sub-classification within the existing list. The Supreme Court's decision clarified that sub-classification doesn't contradict this article's provisions.  The Constitution doesn't directly address sub-classification, but the court interpreted existing articles to allow it under certain conditions.


**9. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and are applicable to all states and union territories in India.
2.  Appeals from the decisions of Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases are heard by the High Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, specifically *exempts* certain states (Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim) and tribal areas from its purview.  The Act's applicability is not uniform across the entire country. The specific exclusion of certain regions highlights the sensitivity to diverse local contexts and administrative structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in civil cases go to the *district court*, not directly to the High Court.  This tiered system ensures that cases are initially dealt with at a local level, and only escalated to higher courts if necessary. The district court acts as an intermediary appellate court before the High Court.


**10. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Both civil and criminal contempt are defined under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and are punishable under the same provisions of the Act.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines both civil and criminal contempt, the *punishments* for each type of contempt are different and are determined based on the nature and severity of the contempt.  The Act differentiates between the two types of contempt, and each has its distinct consequences.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution explicitly grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the inherent power to punish for contempt of court.  This power is essential to uphold the authority and integrity of the judicial system.  The constitutional provisions provide the legal basis for the courts' power to deal with contempt.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Cabinet Secretary:**

1. The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the President of India based solely on seniority.
2. The Cabinet Secretary has direct administrative control over all working departments of the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretary is appointed by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC), not the President, and the selection is based on *seniority-cum-merit*, not solely on seniority.  Merit considerations are equally important in the selection process. The ACC's decision reflects a balance between experience and capability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cabinet Secretary does *not* have direct administrative control over individual working departments of the Union Government. The Cabinet Secretary's role is primarily to facilitate inter-ministerial coordination and ensure smooth functioning of the government machinery.  The Cabinet Secretary is considered a "primus inter pares" (first among equals) among secretaries, not a superior administrator over each department.


**12. With reference to the President's Address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 86 of the Constitution mandates that the President must address both Houses of Parliament assembled together at the beginning of every session.
2. Article 87 allows the President to address either House of Parliament separately or both Houses together.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 86 permits the President to address either House or both Houses assembled together, but it doesn't *mandate* such an address at the beginning of every session. The President's addressing of Parliament is discretionary, not compulsory for every session.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 87 outlines specific instances where the President *must* address both Houses assembled together—at the beginning of the first session after a general election and at the beginning of the first session of each year.  This provision ensures that the President's address provides a formal opening to new parliamentary sessions.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., extends only to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2. Article 72 specifically empowers the President to commute a sentence of death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, etc., in cases where the sentence is given by a court-martial, *but it also extends* to cases involving offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends and to death sentences. The President's power is wider than just court-martial cases.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute a death sentence. This power is a significant aspect of executive clemency and is often exercised in capital punishment cases.  The President's decision in such matters is final.


**14. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2.  The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is derived from its inherent powers under Article 141 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the final legal recourse available to a litigant and is only permitted *after* a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court. It's a last resort mechanism.  The curative petition ensures that all possible avenues for legal redress have been exhausted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions originates from Article 142, which empowers it to do complete justice, not Article 141. Article 141 deals with the law declared by the Supreme Court being binding on all courts. Article 142 provides the basis for the court's inherent power to address exceptional situations.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, excluding disputes related to land ownership.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the High Court, and they are deemed to be a Court of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are indeed established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and possess both civil and criminal jurisdiction,  the statement incorrectly limits their jurisdiction.  Gram Nyayalayas *do* handle disputes related to land ownership, provided they fall under the category of petty disputes which they are designed to settle at the village level.  The exclusion of land disputes is not accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The appointment process of the Nyayadhikari and their status as a court of a Judicial Magistrate of the First Class are accurately described.  The consultation with the High Court ensures judicial oversight and maintains standards.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.  The inaccuracy in statement 1 makes option (b) the only viable choice.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court, but not necessarily involve direct disobedience to a court order.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively, and is defined exclusively under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  It correctly differentiates between civil and criminal contempt. Civil contempt focuses on the willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority, including but not limited to direct disobedience. The description is not fully precise, but it captures the essence of the difference.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Articles 129 and 215 do grant the Supreme Court and High Courts the power to punish for contempt, the statement is misleading by implying that the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, is the *exclusive* definition. The Constitution provides the inherent power, and the Act further defines and outlines the procedures related to contempt. The Act supplements, rather than exclusively defines, the constitutional provision.

Therefore, only statement 1 provides a largely accurate, albeit slightly imprecise, description.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in the specified states, and these councils have legislative, executive, and judicial powers over various subjects including land revenue collection and forest management.
2.  The establishment of ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule is based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, and each ADC consists of a maximum of 30 members, with 26 elected and 4 nominated by the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule does grant the Governor the power to establish ADCs and ARCs.  These councils possess extensive powers across multiple domains, including legislative, executive, and certain judicial functions. Their authority over land revenue, forest management, and other specified subjects is accurately reflected in the statement.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the establishment is indeed based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, the statement incorrectly identifies the President as the nominating authority for the 4 nominated members of an ADC.  It is the Governor, not the President, who nominates these members.

Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct option.  The error regarding the nominating authority in statement 2 is a significant inaccuracy.


**4. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to form a new state or alter the boundaries of existing states rests solely with the Parliament, and the President's recommendation is not required for initiating such a process.
2.  Article 3 of the Constitution outlines the process for the formation of new states, including the power of Parliament to unite parts of states or unite any territory to a part of any state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Although Parliament holds the power to form new states or alter boundaries, it is fundamentally inaccurate to state that the President’s recommendation is *not* required.  The constitutional process explicitly mandates the President's recommendation before a Bill concerning state formation can be introduced in Parliament.  This is a crucial safeguard against arbitrary actions.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 of the Constitution clearly outlines the powers of Parliament regarding the formation of new states and alteration of existing ones, including the options of uniting parts of states or adding territories.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The omission of the President's crucial role in statement 1 is a major flaw.


**5. With reference to Mercy Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only in cases where the conviction is by a court-martial or for offences against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2. The President's power to decide on mercy petitions extends to all cases involving death sentences, regardless of whether the conviction is by a court-martial or a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Article 72 does encompass court-martial convictions and offenses under Union executive power,  the statement incorrectly limits the President's power. The President's power extends to *all* death sentences, irrespective of the type of court that delivered the verdict.  The limitation stated in the option is a misrepresentation of the constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is correct.  The President's power to consider mercy petitions encompasses all death penalty cases, not only those specified in Statement 1. This is a fundamental aspect of the President's executive clemency powers.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.  Statement 1 presents a significantly incomplete and misleading description of Article 72.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court, and it is the last available legal remedy in the Indian judicial system.
2.  The Supreme Court’s power to entertain curative petitions is derived from Article 142, which empowers the court to do complete justice, and such petitions are admissible only if there is a violation of principles of natural justice or an apprehension of bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition is dismissed by the Supreme Court.  It serves as the final avenue for redressal within the judicial framework.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems from Article 142, which allows the court to ensure complete justice.  The grounds for admissibility typically include violations of natural justice or the presence of bias that could have affected the judgment.

Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Both statements accurately reflect the nature and scope of curative petitions in India.


**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs are established under a centrally sponsored scheme funded entirely by state governments and primarily focus on cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. FTSCs aim for swift disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, and a significant number of these courts are operational across various states and union territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs are indeed part of a centrally sponsored scheme aiming for faster justice, the funding is primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund, a central initiative. The statement incorrectly attributes the funding to state governments alone. Additionally, while POCSO cases are a major focus, FTSCs handle a broader range of rape cases beyond just those under the POCSO Act.

Statement 2 is correct.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO cases, and the fact that a large number of these courts are functional across many states and UTs is accurately stated.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding funding and scope are significant.


**8. With reference to Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee are constituted by the Rajya Sabha, and their reports are submitted to the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2.  Parliamentary Committees derive their authority from Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution, which deal with the privileges of Members of Parliament and the Parliament's power to make rules for its procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While both committees are crucial, the statement incorrectly assigns their constitution to the Rajya Sabha.  Both the Public Accounts Committee and the Estimates Committee are constituted by the Lok Sabha, not the Rajya Sabha. Their reports are submitted to the Lok Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, although the Speaker plays a crucial role in their functioning.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 105 and 118 of the Constitution form the constitutional basis for the authority and functioning of Parliamentary Committees.  Article 105 deals with MPs' privileges, and Article 118 gives Parliament the power to regulate its procedures.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct, making (b) the right answer. The inaccuracies regarding the constitution and reporting mechanism of the committees in statement 1 are significant.


**9. With reference to the Committee on Official Languages (PCOL), consider the following statements:**

1. The PCOL was constituted in 1976 under the Official Languages Act, 1963, and its membership comprises 30 members (15 from Lok Sabha and 15 from Rajya Sabha) elected through proportional representation.
2. The PCOL reviews the progress of Hindi's use for official purposes at the Union level and submits its recommendations to the President, and it was established ten years after the enactment of the Official Languages Act, 1963.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly states the membership composition of the PCOL.  While the PCOL was indeed constituted under Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963 (and not in 1976), its membership is 30 (20 from Lok Sabha and 10 from Rajya Sabha), not 15 from each house.  The election method of proportional representation is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The PCOL reviews Hindi's progress in official Union use and reports to the President.  The establishment ten years after the Act's enactment is also accurate.

Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct, making (b) the correct answer.  The error in the membership composition in statement 1 is a significant factual inaccuracy.


**10. With reference to Cabinet Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cabinet Committees are mentioned in the Constitution and are chaired by the President, and their establishment is governed by the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961.
2.  Cabinet Committees facilitate decision-making on specific policy areas, and their membership typically includes only Cabinet Ministers, although non-cabinet ministers can also be members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cabinet Committees are *not* mentioned in the Constitution. They are extra-constitutional bodies. The statement also incorrectly states that they are chaired by the President; they are chaired by the Prime Minister or other designated senior ministers.  The mention of the 1961 rules is correct.

Statement 2 is correct.  Cabinet Committees streamline decision-making on specific policy matters.  While their membership primarily consists of Cabinet Ministers, the inclusion of non-cabinet ministers is possible.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding constitutional mention, the chair, and the implication of exclusivity are substantial.


**11. With reference to Special Category States (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, and states granted SCS status receive special funding based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
2.  The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS, and on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS category was abolished, leading to the cessation of special funding patterns for northeastern and Himalayan states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The introduction of SCS in 1969 based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations is accurate.  The use of the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula for funding is also generally correct, although it's important to note that the formula has evolved over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly provide for the SCS category.  The 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations did lead to the phasing out of the SCS category, but the statement is inaccurate in stating that this led to the cessation of *all* special funding for northeastern and Himalayan states.  Such funding continues, though under different mechanisms and based on other recommendations.

Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct, making (a) the correct option.  The inaccuracies in statement 2 regarding constitutional basis and the complete cessation of special funding are significant.


**12. With reference to Special Packages for States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Special Packages are provided to states based on a formula outlined in the Constitution, and they are primarily allocated to states facing geographical challenges, such as those in the northeastern region.
2.  Special Packages are discretionary grants provided under Article 282 of the Constitution, and they may be given to states facing various socio-economic challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Special Packages are *not* based on a constitutional formula. They are discretionary and not bound by any pre-defined criteria. While they often go to states with geographical challenges, it’s not the exclusive criterion.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 282 does empower the Centre to make discretionary grants, and Special Packages fall under this provision.  They can address various socio-economic challenges faced by states, not just geographical ones.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option. The fundamental error of implying a fixed formula in statement 1 is a crucial inaccuracy.


**13. With reference to the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) systems, consider the following statements:**

1.  In the FPTP system, the country is divided into small geographical units called constituencies, each electing one representative, whereas in PR, large geographical areas are demarcated, and more than one representative may be elected from a single constituency.
2.  FPTP systems encourage voters from different social groups to come together to win an election, while PR systems ensure the representation of all parties based on their vote share, but may lead to less stable coalition governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The description of constituency demarcation in both FPTP and PR systems is accurate. FPTP uses smaller constituencies with one representative each, while PR systems can have larger areas electing multiple representatives.

Statement 2 is also largely correct.  FPTP does encourage broader coalitions to secure victory, while PR aims for proportional representation, potentially leading to coalition governments that might be less stable than those formed under FPTP.  The description is not fully precise, but it captures the essence of the difference.

Therefore, both statements are largely correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Both statements offer a reasonable comparison of the two electoral systems.


**14. With reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules stipulate that applicants for citizenship by naturalization must possess adequate knowledge of any language listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution of India and must provide proof of nationality through documents such as visas and Aadhaar cards.
2.  The rules provide a reduced naturalization period of 5 years for illegal migrants who meet specific criteria, including being Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan, who entered India before December 31, 2014.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, do require applicants for citizenship by naturalization to demonstrate adequate knowledge of a language from the Eighth Schedule. The provision for proof of nationality using various documents, including visas and Aadhaar cards, is also accurate.

Statement 2 is also correct. The rules do provide a shortened naturalization period of 5 years for illegal migrants who meet the specified religious and geographical criteria and entered India before the given cut-off date.

Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.  Both statements accurately reflect key provisions of the amended rules.


**15. With reference to the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders, consider the following statements:**

1. The OCI scheme was introduced in 1969 and allows individuals of Indian origin to live and work in India without any restrictions, and the Ministry of External Affairs recently confirmed that there will be no reclassification of OCI cardholders as foreigners.
2. The existing rules for OCI cardholders remain unchanged and provide certain rights and privileges to OCI cardholders, and the Ministry of External Affairs has clarified that the OCI cardholders will continue to enjoy the same rights and privileges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The OCI scheme was *not* introduced in 1969.  The year is inaccurate. While the statement correctly mentions the recent clarification from the Ministry of External Affairs regarding reclassification, the claim about unrestricted living and working is an oversimplification.  OCI cardholders do have certain restrictions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Ministry of External Affairs has indeed confirmed that the existing OCI rules remain unchanged, assuring that cardholders will continue to enjoy their existing rights and privileges.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option. The factual error regarding the OCI scheme's introduction year and the oversimplification of its provisions in statement 1 are significant inaccuracies.


**16. With reference to Foreigners Tribunals in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Foreigners Tribunals are quasi-judicial bodies established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, and they have the power to declare a person a foreigner, and their decisions are subject to judicial review by the Supreme Court.
2.  Exclusion from the National Register of Citizens (NRC) in Assam automatically classifies a person as a foreigner, and Foreigners Tribunals have the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Foreigners Tribunals are indeed quasi-judicial bodies established under the 1964 Order. They do possess the authority to declare someone a foreigner, and their decisions are subject to judicial review, including by the Supreme Court.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Exclusion from the NRC in Assam does *not* automatically classify a person as a foreigner.  It triggers further proceedings, where the Foreigners Tribunal plays a crucial role.  The statement about the powers of a civil court is correct.

Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct, making (a) the correct option.  The inaccurate implication of automatic foreigner status upon NRC exclusion in statement 2 is a significant flaw.


**17. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to improve the quality of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) by promoting the use of digital technology and data analytics, and it focuses on the preparation of PDPs at the Gram Panchayat level only.
2.  The campaign aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26, and it involves structured meetings at various levels, including Gram Sabhas, and utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, the statement incorrectly emphasizes digital technology and data analytics as the primary focus.  The campaign's core goal is to increase public participation.  The statement also incorrectly limits the scope to the Gram Panchayat level; it encompasses all three tiers of Panchayats.

Statement 2 is correct.  The campaign's aim to enhance public participation in preparing PDPs for 2025-26 is accurate.  The use of structured meetings at different levels, including Gram Sabhas, and the use of the PDI to identify developmental gaps are also correct.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct option.  The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding focus and scope are significant.


**18. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such centre in the world and aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, and it will exclusively focus on the auditing of urban local bodies.
2.  The iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, and it will collaborate with international organizations and share best practices in local governance auditing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is indeed the first such centre in India, not the world. The statement incorrectly limits its focus to urban local bodies; it intends to cover a broader range of local governance bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary aim of iCAL is to set global standards and promote best practices in local governance auditing through international collaboration.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the correct answer. The inaccuracies in statement 1 regarding global uniqueness and scope are significant.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, but excludes disputes related to land ownership exceeding a certain value.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Government in consultation with the High Court, and they are not bound by the strict rules of evidence outlined in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are indeed established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and possess jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters, the statement incorrectly implies a restriction on land ownership disputes.  The Act aims to settle petty disputes at the village level, and the value limit on land disputes isn't a universal restriction imposed by the Act itself. The specific monetary or value limits on cases handled might vary based on state-level regulations or interpretations, but it's not an inherent limitation of the Act's design.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Nyayadhikari's appointment process aligns with the description provided. The Act explicitly allows for a more flexible approach to evidence, prioritizing principles of natural justice over rigid adherence to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872's technicalities. This approach is designed to make the justice system more accessible and less intimidating for villagers.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Contempt of Court:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt primarily focuses on actions that obstruct the administration of justice, such as the unauthorized recording of court proceedings.
2.  The power to punish for contempt of court is vested solely in the Supreme Court of India, as per Article 129 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Civil contempt relates to the defiance of court orders or undertakings, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize the court, prejudice judicial proceedings, or obstruct justice.  While unauthorized recording might constitute contempt, it's not the sole focus of criminal contempt; the definition encompasses a broader range of actions aimed at undermining the judicial process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Article 129 grants the Supreme Court the power to punish for contempt, Article 215 extends a similar power to High Courts.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts have inherent powers to ensure their authority and the smooth functioning of the judicial system. The statement's assertion of sole power residing with the Supreme Court is therefore inaccurate.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA, 2019 grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, or Christian communities who have entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan before December 31, 2014, except for those residing in specified tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, or Tripura, and areas under Inner Line Permit.
2.  The CAA, 2019 replaces the Citizenship Act, 1955, and renders the Foreigners Tribunals established under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, defunct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the key provisions of the CAA, 2019. It outlines the specific religious communities, countries of origin, and timeframe for eligibility, as well as the exemptions related to certain tribal areas and Inner Line Permit regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019 amends the Citizenship Act, 1955, but it does not replace it entirely.  The Foreigners Tribunals continue to exist and function under the Foreigners (Tribunals) Order, 1964, even after the enactment of the CAA. The CAA does not alter the existence or functions of these quasi-judicial bodies.


**4. With reference to the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders, consider the following statements:**

1. OCI cardholders enjoy most of the rights of an Indian citizen except the right to vote and hold certain government positions.
2.  The Ministry of External Affairs has the sole authority to cancel the OCI registration of an individual.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is generally correct. OCI cardholders are granted various rights similar to Indian citizens, but some rights, such as voting rights and holding certain government positions, are excluded.  The exact extent of rights might be subject to specific regulations and interpretations, but the core idea is that they enjoy a significant subset of citizen rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Ministry of External Affairs plays a crucial role in OCI matters, the authority to cancel OCI registration isn't solely vested in them.  The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, outlines specific grounds for cancellation, and the process likely involves multiple agencies or levels of government.  Attributing sole authority to the Ministry of External Affairs is an oversimplification of the process.


**5. Consider the following statements about the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences under Article 72 extends only to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial or for offenses against laws related to matters under the Union's executive power.
2.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and cannot be challenged in any court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to commute death sentences.  The statement's limitation of the President's power only to court-martial cases or offenses under the Union's executive power is too restrictive and ignores a crucial aspect of the Article's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's decision carries significant weight, it's not entirely unchallengeable.  There have been instances where judicial reviews have been sought, though the scope of such reviews might be limited.  The assertion of absolute finality is thus inaccurate.


**6. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition, and it is essentially a last resort for seeking redressal of a perceived injustice.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142 of the Constitution, which allows it to do complete justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the nature and basis of curative petitions.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the procedural context and hierarchical position of curative petitions within the judicial system.  Statement 2 correctly points to the constitutional source of the Supreme Court's authority to entertain such petitions. The power stems from Article 142, which empowers the Court to ensure complete justice, even if it requires going beyond strict procedural norms in exceptional cases.


**7. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established under a centrally sponsored scheme funded entirely by the states, aiming for the speedy disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The implementation of FTSCs is monitored by the Ministry of Women and Child Development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs do aim for speedy disposal of POCSO Act cases,  they are a centrally sponsored scheme, with funding primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund (a central fund).  The statement's assertion of state-only funding is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The implementation of FTSCs falls under the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, not the Ministry of Women and Child Development. While the latter ministry has a significant role in matters related to women and children, the operational responsibility for FTSCs lies with the Department of Justice.


**8. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005 mandates that all public authorities proactively disclose certain categories of information to minimize the need for formal requests, and the Central Information Commission (CIC) is responsible for enforcing this provision.
2.  Cooperative societies registered under state-level cooperative societies acts are considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act, 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, promotes proactive disclosure of information by public authorities, and the CIC plays a key role in overseeing the implementation and addressing appeals related to information disclosure.  Proactive disclosure is a cornerstone of the Act's design, aiming to enhance transparency and reduce the burden on individuals who need to file formal requests for information.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Judicial pronouncements, like the Madras High Court ruling mentioned earlier, have clarified that cooperative societies registered under state-level acts are not automatically considered Public Authorities under the RTI Act, 2005.  The status of such entities is subject to case-by-case determination based on factors like the extent of government funding and control.


**9. With reference to the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, and these councils have significant powers over land revenue collection and forest management.
2.  The Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) in the Sixth Schedule areas are directly accountable to the ADCs and ARCs and not to the State Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule provides the constitutional framework for the establishment and functioning of ADCs and ARCs in the specified states. These councils possess considerable autonomy in areas like land revenue, forest management, and other matters related to the well-being of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ADCs and ARCs have substantial powers, PRIs in Sixth Schedule areas maintain a degree of independence and are not solely accountable to the councils. The relationship between PRIs and the councils is complex and can vary, with some degree of interaction and coordination.  Complete subordination of PRIs to ADCs and ARCs is not accurate.


**10. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The process of forming a new state requires a resolution passed by the state legislature of the state from which the new state is to be carved out, followed by a bill passed by both houses of Parliament.
2.  The President of India plays a crucial role in the formation of new states, as the process is initiated only upon their recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Parliament's approval is essential, a state legislature's resolution isn't a mandatory prerequisite. The process is primarily driven by a parliamentary initiative based on the President's recommendation under Article 3 of the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly states that a bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in Parliament only on the President's recommendation.  This highlights the President's crucial role in initiating the process.  The President's recommendation is a formal requirement before Parliament can even begin considering the formation of a new state.


**11. With reference to Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs), consider the following statements:**

1.  EVMs are manufactured by public sector undertakings under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and VVPATs were first introduced in the 2019 Lok Sabha General Elections.
2.  The Supreme Court of India has mandated a 100% cross-verification of EVM data with VVPAT records in all elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. EVMs are manufactured by Bharat Electronics Limited (under the Ministry of Defence) and Electronics Corporation of India Limited (under the Department of Atomic Energy), not under the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.  Further, VVPATs were first used in Goa in 2017, not fully deployed across the country until the 2019 elections.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has not mandated 100% cross-verification of EVM data with VVPAT records.  While concerns about EVM integrity have been raised, the court's decisions have not involved a blanket mandate for such extensive cross-verification in every election.  The extent of VVPAT-based verification might vary based on election-specific circumstances and court orders.


**12. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The MCC is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India to regulate the conduct of political parties and candidates during elections, and it is legally binding on all participants.
2.  The MCC was first introduced in India during the 1951 Lok Sabha General Elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MCC is not legally binding in the strictest sense. While it carries significant moral and political weight, violations don't automatically lead to criminal prosecution.  The Election Commission relies on persuasion, warnings, and public pressure to ensure compliance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during the Kerala State Assembly elections, not in 1951. The evolution of electoral practices and regulations has led to refinements and expansions of the MCC over time.  The 1951 election did not have the MCC in its current form.


**13. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) examines the audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) and scrutinizes government expenditure, while the Estimates Committee focuses on evaluating the efficiency of government programs and policies.
2.  The members of the Parliamentary Committees are appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the distinct roles of the PAC and the Estimates Committee. The PAC's focus is on post-expenditure scrutiny, while the Estimates Committee's role is to pre-emptively examine the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending.  The division of labor between these two committees is a key element of parliamentary oversight.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Members of Parliamentary Committees are not appointed directly by the President. The process involves elections by the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha (for some committees) or nominations by the Speaker. The President does not have a direct role in the selection of committee members.



**1. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states,  based on criteria including income distance, area, and population (2011).
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, using a multi-criteria approach that included income distance, area, population (2011 census), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  This reflects the complex nature of resource allocation in a federal system, aiming for a balance between equity and efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can only borrow within the country. This restriction is a key element of India's fiscal federalism, designed to maintain macroeconomic stability and prevent excessive external debt at the state level.  The Union government, however, has the power to borrow both domestically and internationally (Article 292).  The difference highlights the asymmetrical power distribution within the fiscal framework.


**2. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly mentioned in Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the system of granting Special Category Status was abolished, and alternative funding mechanisms were established for Northeastern and Himalayan states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Indian Constitution does *not* contain any explicit provision for granting Special Category Status. While numerous special provisions exist for various states under Articles 371 and subsequent articles, there's no single article defining or creating the SCS category. The SCS was a policy decision based on recommendations of Finance Commissions, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS system.  While Northeastern and Himalayan states continue to receive special funding, this is now based on different criteria and mechanisms, primarily through Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) and other targeted programs rather than the blanket categorization of SCS.  The shift reflects a move towards more targeted and transparent financial assistance.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are primarily funded by the state governments, with the central government providing supplementary funding based on the state's financial capacity.
2. NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring CSSs and overseeing third-party evaluations, ensuring efficient resource allocation and program effectiveness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes are jointly funded by the central and state governments. However, the central government bears the larger share of the funding, reflecting its role in setting national priorities and ensuring uniformity in implementing schemes across states. The funding pattern varies depending on the specific scheme and the state's developmental needs.  It is not solely dependent on the state's financial capacity.

Statement 2 is correct.  NITI Aayog, a policy think tank, plays a vital role in the monitoring and evaluation of CSSs. This includes overseeing third-party evaluations to assess program effectiveness, identify areas for improvement, and ensure that resources are utilized efficiently to achieve the desired outcomes.  This reflects the importance of evidence-based policy making and accountability in the implementation of central government schemes.


**4. With reference to the Capacity Building Commission (CBC) and Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi primarily focuses on capacity building for elected representatives at the state and local levels.
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from role-based training to rule-based training, emphasizing adherence to established regulations and procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi focuses on capacity building for *civil servants* at the Union Government level, not elected representatives.  The program aims to enhance the skills and competencies of bureaucrats to effectively implement government policies and programs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is precisely the *opposite*: a shift from rule-based training to *role-based* training. This emphasizes competency development and adaptability, moving away from rigid adherence to rules and towards a more flexible and outcome-oriented approach to capacity building.  The goal is to create a more agile and responsive civil service.


**5. With reference to the People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan primarily focuses on the preparation of District Development Plans (DDPs) for the upcoming fiscal year.
2. The campaign utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat level, aligning with the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does involve preparation of development plans at multiple levels (Gram Panchayat, Block Panchayat, and District Panchayat), its primary focus is on the preparation of *Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs)*.  The campaign emphasizes bottom-up planning and community participation at the grassroots level, and the GPDP is the foundational document.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly uses the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat level.  This is crucial for aligning local development priorities with the broader national goals of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), ensuring that local plans contribute to national development targets.  The thematic approach emphasizes a holistic approach to development.


**6. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is an initiative of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to improve financial accountability at the local level.
2.  The primary focus of iCAL is to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies, promoting transparency and good governance practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the iCAL aims to improve financial accountability, it is not an initiative of the CAG.  It's a separate center established to set global standards and promote best practices in auditing local governance. The CAG has its own established audit mechanisms for local bodies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core mandate of iCAL is to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies. This involves developing best practices, capacity building, and promoting greater transparency and accountability in the management of local finances.  This is crucial for strengthening local governance and improving public service delivery.


**7. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI has the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for violations of data protection laws but cannot direct data fiduciaries to take remedial measures in case of data breaches.
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are heard by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPBI does have the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for violations, and it *also* has the power to direct them to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach. This reflects the board's broad mandate to enforce data protection laws.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Appeals against the DPBI's decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  This is because the DPBI's jurisdiction primarily relates to data protection within the digital sphere,  and the TDSAT has established expertise in such matters.


**8. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is enshrined in the Constitution of India under Article 324, which outlines the Election Commission's powers.
2. Violations of the MCC are directly punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is *not* a constitutional provision. While the Election Commission's authority stems from Article 324, the MCC itself is a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission.  It's not a legally binding document in the same way as a statute or constitutional provision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Violations of the MCC are not directly punishable under the IPC.  While certain actions that violate the MCC might also constitute offences under other laws (like the Representation of the People Act), the MCC itself doesn't have direct penal consequences.  The Election Commission primarily uses its powers to issue warnings, reprimands, or recommend other actions.


**9. With reference to Lok Sabha elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Sabha elections utilize a proportional representation system, where seats are allocated to parties based on their overall vote share.
2. Each Lok Sabha constituency elects multiple representatives to ensure broader representation of diverse interests.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Sabha elections employ a *first-past-the-post* system (also known as simple majority system), not proportional representation.  In this system, the candidate who secures the most votes in a constituency wins the seat, regardless of the overall vote share of their party.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Each Lok Sabha constituency elects only *one* representative. This is a key feature of the first-past-the-post system, which often leads to disproportionate representation of parties based on their national vote share.  The system prioritizes local representation over proportional representation of national parties.


**10. With reference to Aadhaar in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar uniquely identifies individuals based on demographic details like caste, religion, and income, ensuring comprehensive data capture.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared Aadhaar mandatory for all financial transactions, including opening bank accounts and accessing online services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar does *not* capture demographic details like caste, religion, and income.  It primarily uses biometric data (fingerprints, iris scans) and a unique identification number to identify individuals.  The focus is on biometric uniqueness, not demographic profiling.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment *did not* declare Aadhaar mandatory for all financial transactions.  While it upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, it also clarified that Aadhaar cannot be forced on people for opening bank accounts or accessing online services.  It made Aadhaar mandatory only for accessing certain government welfare schemes.  The ruling emphasized the importance of balancing the benefits of Aadhaar with the right to privacy.


**11. With reference to the Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. It exclusively deals with the distribution of financial resources between the Union and State governments.
2. It clearly defines the tax bases that are exclusively levied and collected by either the Union or the State governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Seventh Schedule of the Indian Constitution primarily deals with the *distribution of legislative powers* between the Union and State governments, dividing subjects into three lists: Union List, State List, and Concurrent List.  While financial matters are certainly relevant to these powers, the Seventh Schedule is not solely focused on the distribution of financial resources.  That aspect is addressed through other constitutional provisions and the recommendations of Finance Commissions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Seventh Schedule's lists clearly define which subjects fall under the exclusive legislative competence of the Union or the States.  This implicitly defines the tax bases that each level of government can levy, though the actual division of tax revenues is a more complex issue, addressed through other constitutional provisions and intergovernmental agreements.


**12. With reference to the powers of the Union Government to make grants, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union government can only make grants to State governments for subjects that fall under the Union List in the Seventh Schedule.
2. Article 282 of the Indian Constitution empowers the Union government to make grants for any public purpose, even if it is not within its legislative competence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 275 of the Indian Constitution allows the Union government to make grants-in-aid to States even for subjects in the State List.  This is a crucial aspect of fiscal federalism, allowing the Centre to support State initiatives, even in areas under their primary jurisdiction. The Union government is not restricted to granting funds only for subjects listed in the Union List.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 282 provides the Union government with the power to make grants for any public purpose, regardless of whether it falls within its legislative competence.  This is a broad provision that gives the Centre considerable flexibility in providing financial assistance for various national priorities.  This discretionary power is subject to judicial review, however, ensuring that it is not abused.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the debt-GDP ratio of States in India:**

1. The debt-GDP ratio of States is calculated as the total debt of all State governments divided by the total GDP of India.
2.  As of March 2023, the debt-GDP ratio of States in India was significantly lower than the debt-GDP ratio of the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The debt-GDP ratio of States is calculated as the *total debt of a particular State* divided by the *GDP of that State*, not the total GDP of India.  Each State has its own debt-GDP ratio, reflecting its individual fiscal health.  The aggregate debt-GDP ratio for all States is a separate calculation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Generally, the debt-GDP ratio of States in India has historically been lower than the debt-GDP ratio of the Union Government. However, this can fluctuate depending on various economic factors and fiscal policies of both the Union and State governments.  The comparison highlights the difference in the fiscal capacity and responsibilities of different levels of government.  The relative difference is a significant aspect of fiscal federalism.


**14. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous district councils in certain states of Northeast India.
2. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), establishes autonomous district councils in four states of Northeast India: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils are designed to provide greater autonomy to tribal communities in these regions, allowing for greater self-governance in local affairs.  The structure reflects the specific historical and socio-political context of these regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule was indeed incorporated into the Indian Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, formed to address the concerns and aspirations of tribal communities in Assam.  The committee's recommendations highlighted the need for greater self-governance and autonomy for these communities, leading to the inclusion of the Sixth Schedule.  The committee's work reflects the historical context of constitutional development in India.



**1. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool for states, based on factors including income distance, area, and population.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money both within and outside India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states.  This devolution is based on multiple criteria, prominently including income distance, area, population (2011 census data), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  These criteria reflect the Commission's attempt to balance developmental needs and fiscal capacity across different states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can only borrow within the country. This restriction is a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism, aiming to maintain central control over external borrowings and prevent potential imbalances in the national economy.  The Union government, however, has the power to borrow both domestically and internationally (as per Article 292).  The restriction on state-level external borrowing underscores the hierarchical nature of India's fiscal arrangement.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly mentioned in the Indian Constitution.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the system of granting Special Category Status was discontinued.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain any provision explicitly defining or establishing the concept of Special Category Status.  The granting of SCS was a policy decision based on various Finance Commission recommendations and aimed at addressing the unique developmental challenges faced by certain states.  This lack of constitutional basis highlights the discretionary nature of SCS grants and their susceptibility to political considerations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the Special Category Status system. This reform aimed to create a more uniform and equitable distribution of resources among states, moving away from the potentially discriminatory nature of the SCS categorization.  While special funding continues for some states (like Northeastern and Himalayan states), it's now based on different criteria and not on the former SCS designation.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are primarily funded by the states, with the central government providing supplementary funding as needed.
2.  NITI Aayog plays a significant role in the monitoring and evaluation of CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Centrally Sponsored Schemes are jointly funded by the central and state governments, but the central government bears a larger share of the funding. The funding pattern varies depending on the scheme and the state (e.g., 90:10 for some Northeastern and Himalayan states, 60:40 for others).  The statement wrongly reverses the primary funding source.

Statement 2 is correct. NITI Aayog has a crucial role in the monitoring and evaluation of CSSs.  This includes overseeing third-party evaluations to ensure effective implementation and accountability.  The involvement of NITI Aayog reflects the government's focus on evidence-based policymaking and improving the efficiency of centrally sponsored schemes.  The concurrent jurisdiction with other agencies ensures comprehensive monitoring.


**4.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi primarily focuses on capacity building for contractual employees within the Union Government.
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from role-based to rule-based training and capacity building.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mission Karmayogi includes contractual employees, its scope is far broader, encompassing all civil servants across various ministries and departments of the Union Government. The program aims for a comprehensive overhaul of civil service training and development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi advocates a *shift from rule-based to role-based* training and capacity building. This fundamental change emphasizes competency-based development, focusing on the actual roles and responsibilities of civil servants rather than merely adhering to prescribed rules. The statement incorrectly reverses the intended shift.


**5.  Consider the following statements about the auditing of local bodies in India:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India directly conducts the audits of all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG has overall supervisory control, the direct audits of local bodies are typically conducted through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level, working under the CAG's technical guidance. The CAG doesn't directly conduct all audits at each level of PRIs.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a significant initiative by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to streamline and improve the online auditing of panchayat accounts. This aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the utilization of funds at the grassroots level.  The application has received international recognition for its contribution to improving governance.


**6. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar is a proof of both citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of identity and address for residents of India, but it is *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined by separate legal provisions, and domicile is determined by separate state-level laws.  Aadhaar only verifies identity and address, not legal status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* actually *upheld* the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, subject to certain conditions and safeguards regarding data protection and privacy.  The judgment did not declare the Act unconstitutional but rather clarified its limitations and scope.


**7. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for the alteration of the religious character of any place of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.
2. The Act prohibits the filing of any new suits challenging the existing ownership of places of worship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, explicitly states that the religious character of a place of worship will remain the same as it was on August 15, 1947.  This provision aims to maintain the status quo and prevent disputes based on religious conversions or changes in ownership. The Act freezes the religious character as it stood at independence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Act aims to prevent new legal challenges to the existing status of places of worship.  While it doesn't explicitly prohibit all suits, the Supreme Court has issued directives to stay the filing of new suits challenging ownership or seeking surveys of disputed religious sites. This underscores the Act's intention to maintain peace and harmony by preventing further litigations on the religious character of places of worship.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule is primarily concerned with the administration of Union Territories.
2. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were instrumental in the formulation of the Sixth Schedule.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states of Northeast India, not Union Territories.  It provides for autonomous district councils and regional councils to manage the affairs of these areas, recognizing the unique needs and traditions of tribal communities.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations played a crucial role in shaping the Sixth Schedule.  The committee was tasked with examining the problems of administration in Assam and other areas and proposed a system of autonomous councils for tribal areas.  The Sixth Schedule, therefore, reflects the committee's efforts to create a framework for self-governance in these regions.  The committee's recommendations addressed the specific needs and complexities of these areas.



**1. With reference to the Indian Passport system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central Government can exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement based on public interest considerations.
2.  Only citizens of India are eligible to receive Indian passports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that the Central government has the authority to exempt individuals from the passport requirement if deemed necessary in the public interest. This demonstrates a degree of flexibility within the system.  This exception is crucial for handling cases requiring special consideration, allowing for humanitarian aid, diplomatic efforts, or other situations overriding the general passport rule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that the Central Government can issue a passport to a non-citizen of India if it is in the public interest. This provision highlights the potential for exceptional cases where a passport might be granted for reasons related to national security, international cooperation, or humanitarian concerns.  The Indian passport system isn't strictly limited to only Indian citizens.


**2. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are solely responsible for delivering government services to rural citizens in India.
2. CSC SPV, established under the Companies Act of 1956, oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSCs are a significant component of service delivery to rural areas, they are not solely responsible.  The text indicates that CSCs provide services from government, private, and social sectors in an integrated manner.  Other mechanisms and initiatives contribute to service delivery in rural areas.  The statement oversimplifies the complex network of service provision.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act of 1956. This clarifies the legal framework and organizational structure behind the CSC initiative. This detail underscores the importance of understanding the institutional context of government programs.


**3. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 reflects an improvement in press freedom compared to previous years.
2.  The WPFI 2024 was published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading NGO advocating for freedom of information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage only states India's ranking (159 out of 180), but does not provide comparative data to determine whether this represents an improvement or decline from previous years.  The absence of comparative data makes it impossible to assess the trend in press freedom.  This highlights the importance of interpreting data within its context.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly identifies Reporters Without Borders (RSF) as the publisher of the WPFI 2024, and describes it as a leading NGO in the defense and promotion of freedom of information. This establishes the credibility and authority of the index. This is relevant for understanding the source and potential biases in such rankings.


**4. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1. The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 50% share of divisible pool for states.
2. Grants-in-aid to states are provided by the Centre as per Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the share of states from the divisible pool currently stands at 41%, based on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission.  This indicates a significant difference from the claim in the statement. This highlights the need for precise recall of numerical data in policy analysis.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Centre provides grants-in-aid to states as per Article 275 of the Constitution. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the constitutional basis of fiscal transfers. This understanding is crucial for analyzing the legal and constitutional framework of Centre-State relations.



**5. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provisions explicitly define the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolition of the SCS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that the Constitution does *not* contain provisions for categorizing states as SCS.  The SCS was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate. This highlights the difference between constitutional provisions and policy decisions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly states that based on the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the SCS ceased to exist. This shows the impact of finance commission recommendations on state fiscal arrangements.  This is crucial for comprehending the evolution of India's fiscal federalism.


**6.  With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are primarily funded by state governments, with supplementary funding from the central government.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text indicates that CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and states.  It does not suggest that state governments are the primary funders. This clarifies a key aspect of the funding mechanism for CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the current CSS framework is based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  This demonstrates the importance of understanding the policy evolution of government programs.


**7. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi focuses solely on training officers of the All India Services.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) plays a role in the implementation of Mission Karmayogi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text specifies that Mission Karmayogi covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments of the Union Government. This is a broader scope than just the All India Services.  The statement misrepresents the target group of the program.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the CBC, launched in 2021 as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi, has completed three years. This shows the direct involvement of the CBC in Mission Karmayogi.


**8. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of central government ministries.
2. iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing *local* governance bodies.  It does not mention auditing central government ministries.  This highlights the specific focus area of iCAL.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies. This underscores iCAL's ambition and its potential impact on local governance worldwide.


**9. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act retains the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933.
2. The Act introduces a framework for granting Right of Way (RoW) on a non-discriminatory basis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Telecommunications Act, 2023, *repeals* the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. This reflects the updating of the legal framework for the telecommunications sector.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage mentions that the Act establishes a framework for granting RoW on a non-discriminatory and non-exclusive basis.  This is a key provision for facilitating infrastructure development in the telecommunications sector.


**10. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar is a proof of both citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. Aadhaar data can be stored indefinitely for the purpose of authentication.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifically states that Aadhaar is *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile. It is a proof of address and identity for residents of India.  This clarifies the limitations and scope of Aadhaar.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions that according to the 2018 Supreme Court judgment, Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This highlights the legal restrictions on data retention related to Aadhaar.


**11. With reference to the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is unconstitutional.
2.  Article 341(2) of the Constitution allows Parliament to include or exclude any caste from the list of Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text highlights that the Supreme Court, in the case of *State of Punjab & Others v Davinder Singh & Others*, held that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is *permissible*. This ruling supports affirmative action to address varying degrees of backwardness within the SC community.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly identifies Article 341(2) as granting Parliament the power to include or exclude castes from the SC list.  This demonstrates an understanding of the legal framework related to Scheduled Castes.


**12. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule grants autonomy to tribal areas within the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram only.
2. The Sixth Schedule was implemented based on recommendations from the Bardoloi Committee.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule does grant autonomy to tribal areas, the statement incorrectly limits its application to only four states.  The passage doesn't explicitly state the exact number of states covered, but implies a wider scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. This demonstrates an understanding of the historical context of the Sixth Schedule.


**1. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha consists of 15 members nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.
2. The Public Accounts Committee is mandated to examine the annual audit reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Committee of Privileges in the Rajya Sabha consists of 10 members, not 15, nominated by the Rajya Sabha Chairman.  The Lok Sabha's Committee of Privileges has 15 members. This difference in membership numbers between the two houses is a key detail often overlooked.  The question plays on this subtle difference to mislead candidates familiar with the general functions of the Committee of Privileges.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Public Accounts Committee's core function, as enshrined in parliamentary procedures, is to scrutinize the CAG's annual audit reports. These reports cover various aspects of government revenue and expenditure, providing crucial oversight of public finances. The statement accurately reflects this crucial responsibility.  The inclusion of this statement acts as a straightforward, easily verifiable component designed to contrast with the more nuanced details of statement 1.


**2. With reference to the Cabinet Committees in the Union Government, consider the following statements:**

1. The establishment of Cabinet Committees is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. The Parliamentary Affairs Committee is chaired by the Minister of Finance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cabinet Committees are extra-constitutional bodies; their formation is governed by the Government of India (Transaction of Business) Rules, 1961, and not explicitly detailed within the Constitution. This is a crucial point highlighting the difference between constitutional and extra-constitutional bodies within the Indian governance structure.  The statement is crafted to test the candidate's understanding of the constitutional framework and its limitations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Parliamentary Affairs Committee is chaired by the Home Minister, not the Minister of Finance. This subtle shift in ministerial responsibility serves as a distractor, relying on candidates' possible assumptions about the committee's functions and the relevant minister's portfolio. The question tests specific knowledge of the committee's composition and leadership.


**3. With reference to the Parliamentary Secretariat, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rajya Sabha Secretariat's recruitment and conditions of service are governed by rules promulgated by the President in consultation with the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2. The Secretary General is the administrative head of both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rajya Sabha Secretariat's recruitment and conditions of service are governed by rules promulgated by the President in consultation with the Chairman of the Rajya Sabha, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  This statement highlights the distinct administrative structures of the two houses of Parliament. The incorrect detail serves as a significant distractor, testing candidates' ability to differentiate between the roles of the Speaker and Chairman.

Statement 2 is correct. The Secretary General serves as the administrative head for both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha Secretariats. This shared administrative leadership is a key feature often overlooked, making this a fact-based question designed to assess detailed knowledge of the parliamentary system. The simplicity of this statement further emphasizes the complexity of statement 1.


**4. With reference to the President's Address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 86 of the Constitution allows the President to address either House of Parliament separately or both Houses together.
2.  The President is constitutionally mandated to address a joint sitting of Parliament at the beginning of each year.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 86 of the Constitution grants the President the power to address either House individually or both Houses assembled together. This provision highlights the President's role in addressing Parliament and the flexibility afforded by the Constitution.  This statement is a relatively straightforward test of constitutional knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 87 mandates the President's address at the beginning of the first session after a general election, it does *not* require an address at the beginning of each year.  The constitution only mandates the address at the commencement of the first session after a general election to the Lok Sabha and at the commencement of the first session of each year. This distinction is designed to test the candidates' careful reading and understanding of the constitutional provision. The incorrect element creates a significant distractor.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President of India based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.
2. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, including the power to summon witnesses and receive evidence on affidavits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NHRC, the recommendation comes from a committee headed by the Prime Minister, not the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.  The statement plays on the common understanding of the President's role in appointments, but tests knowledge of the specific appointing authority.  The incorrect detail serves as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The NHRC is vested with the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, enabling it to summon witnesses, examine them under oath, and receive evidence on affidavits. This statement correctly reflects the NHRC's investigative powers and its ability to function as a quasi-judicial body.  The inclusion of this statement provides a straightforward component for comparison with the more nuanced detail in statement 1.


**6. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a statutory body established under the Constitution of India.
2.  The panel that selects the CBI Director comprises the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is a non-statutory body, governed by the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, not a constitutional body.  The statement incorrectly categorizes the CBI's legal standing, testing the candidate's precise understanding of its establishment and legal basis.  This incorrect detail acts as a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The selection panel for the CBI Director includes the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India. This composition reflects the importance of checks and balances in appointing the head of such a crucial investigative agency.  The statement offers a clear and easily verifiable fact, contrasting with the more nuanced and potentially misleading information in statement 1.


**7. With reference to the Lokpal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lokpal is a state-level anti-corruption ombudsman established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.
2.  The Lokpal's composition includes a chairperson (who must have been a Chief Justice of India) and a maximum of eight members.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lokpal is a central-level (not state-level) anti-corruption ombudsman established under the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013. Lokayuktas operate at the state level. This distinction between the Lokpal and Lokayuktas is crucial for understanding the federal structure of India's anti-corruption mechanisms.  The error in the statement serves as a key distractor.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Lokpal does include a chairperson and a maximum of eight members, the chairperson can be someone who is or has been a Chief Justice of India or a Judge of the Supreme Court; it doesn't strictly mandate a prior Chief Justice of India.  This subtle difference in qualification requirements is a key detail that would differentiate candidates with a thorough understanding of the Lokpal's composition from those with a more superficial knowledge.  The nuanced inaccuracy makes this a challenging statement.


**8. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) for Elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a set of statutory guidelines enshrined in the Representation of the People Act, 1951.
2. The MCC applies only to political parties and their candidates during the election period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is a set of guidelines, not statutory guidelines, laid down by the Election Commission of India (ECI) in consultation with political parties.  It lacks the force of law, unlike provisions within the Representation of the People Act, 1951.  This distinction between guidelines and statutory provisions is crucial for understanding the MCC's legal standing and enforceability. The incorrect categorization serves as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC's scope extends beyond political parties and candidates to encompass the ruling government, government employees, and all those involved in the election process. This broader application is essential for ensuring free and fair elections. The limited scope presented in the statement is designed to test the candidate's understanding of the MCC's reach and impact.  The limited scope acts as a significant distractor.


**9. With reference to the State Election Commission (SEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 mandate the establishment of SECs at the national level.
2. The SEC is responsible for delimiting constituencies for local body elections and overseeing the preparation of electoral rolls.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 provide for the constitution of SECs at the *state* level, not the national level.  The statement incorrectly specifies the level of governance where SECs operate, testing the candidate's understanding of India's federal structure. The misidentification of the level of governance serves as a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEC's responsibilities include delimiting constituencies for local body elections and overseeing the preparation and revision of electoral rolls.  This statement accurately reflects the SEC's key functions in ensuring fair and transparent local body elections. The inclusion of this statement provides a direct and verifiable fact to contrast with the more nuanced information in statement 1.


**10. With reference to the Delimitation Commission, consider the following statements:**

1. The Delimitation Commission's decisions are subject to judicial review by the High Courts.
2.  The Delimitation Commission is responsible for fixing the number of seats and boundaries of constituencies for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Supreme Court can review the Delimitation Commission's orders if they are manifestly arbitrary, High Courts generally do not have this power. The statement incorrectly attributes judicial review powers to the High Courts, testing the candidate's understanding of the legal limitations on challenging the commission's decisions. The incorrect attribution of judicial review powers acts as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Delimitation Commission's core function is to determine the number of seats and the boundaries of constituencies for the Lok Sabha and State Legislative Assemblies.  This is a straightforward and easily verifiable statement, offering a clear contrast to the more nuanced and potentially misleading information in statement 1.  The inclusion of this verifiable statement enhances the difficulty of the question.


**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, based on criteria including income distance, area, and population.
2.  Article 293 of the Constitution permits state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the Union Government's consent if the state is already indebted to the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool of taxes for the states.  This devolution is based on multiple criteria, including income distance, area, population (2011 census data), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  The weighting of these factors is a key aspect of the Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can borrow within India, but if a state is already indebted to the Union Government, further borrowing requires the Union's prior consent. This restriction is a crucial element of India's fiscal federal structure, designed to maintain fiscal discipline and prevent excessive state-level debt accumulation that could destabilize the national economy. The statement incorrectly broadens the scope of permissible borrowing for states.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly mentioned in Articles 370 to 371-J.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants given to states with SCS before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain a specific provision for categorizing states as "Special Category States." While Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J provide special provisions for certain states, these are based on specific circumstances and do not define a general "Special Category Status."  The granting of SCS was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Before the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, states with Special Category Status received grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula. This formula was a crucial element of the financial assistance provided to these states, recognizing their unique developmental challenges.  The 14th Finance Commission's decision to discontinue SCS led to a shift in the approach to financial assistance for these states.


**3. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is aligned with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act dealing with local self-governance.
2.  The first Cantonment in India, Barrackpore, was established in 1765 by the British East India Company after the Battle of Buxar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, but this Act is not aligned with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act (which deals with Panchayats). The administration of cantonments falls under the Union List (Entry 3), reflecting their unique status related to national defense.  The 74th Constitutional Amendment Act pertains to Municipalities, not Cantonments.

Statement 2 is correct.  Barrackpore Cantonment was indeed the first established in India, in 1765, by the British East India Company. However,  it was established *after* the Battle of Plassey (1757), not Buxar (1764). The Battle of Plassey significantly weakened the Nawab of Bengal, paving the way for the East India Company's expansion and the establishment of military cantonments.


**4. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's judgment in ‘M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others’ broadened the scope of Article 19 of the Constitution by including the right to a healthy environment.
2.  The right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change can be linked to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court judgment in ‘M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others’ did *not* primarily relate to Article 19 (right to freedom of speech, etc.).  While environmental concerns can indirectly relate to Article 19, the core of the judgment focused on Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) in relation to the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's judgment rightly recognized that the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change is intrinsically linked to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life).  The right to a healthy environment is now understood as an integral part of the right to life, and any discriminatory environmental policies would violate Article 14.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), is based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2.  The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous District Councils in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura and Mizoram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, under Article 244(2), was based on the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Nehru Committee. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were crucial in shaping the provisions related to the administration of tribal areas in the Northeastern states.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule indeed provides for the establishment of autonomous District Councils in certain areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  These councils have significant administrative and legislative powers concerning the welfare and development of tribal communities in those regions.  This is a key feature of the Schedule, designed to protect and promote the rights of tribal populations.


**6.  With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963,  foreigners require special permits to visit parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, which are designated as Restricted Areas.
2.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand are indeed designated as Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  Foreigners visiting these areas require special permits, reflecting the sensitive nature of these regions and the need for regulated access.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sikkim is *not* entirely a Protected Area.  While parts of Sikkim are designated as Protected Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, other parts are not.  The order differentiates between Protected and Restricted Areas, and Sikkim has a mix of both.  The statement oversimplifies the complex designation of areas within Sikkim.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the distribution of revenue between the Union and States in India:**

1.  Taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned wholly to the States are governed by Article 268 of the Constitution.
2.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) levied and collected in the course of interstate trade or commerce is distributed between the Centre and States based on the recommendations of the GST Council, as per Article 270.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Article 268 of the Indian Constitution deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned wholly to the states. This is a key aspect of the vertical distribution of tax revenue in the Indian federal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 270 deals with the distribution of the net proceeds of certain taxes between the Union and the States.  Article 269A deals with the GST levied and collected in the course of inter-state trade or commerce, and its distribution is based on the recommendations of the GST Council. The statement incorrectly attributes this function to Article 270.


**8. With reference to the borrowing powers of the Union and State Governments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 292 of the Constitution empowers the Union Government to borrow money both within and outside India.
2.  If a State Government is indebted to the Union Government, it cannot borrow further without the prior consent of the Union Government, as per Article 292.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 292 of the Indian Constitution indeed empowers the Union Government to borrow money both within and outside India. This is a crucial aspect of the Union's fiscal powers, allowing it to raise funds to meet its financial obligations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While it is true that a State Government cannot borrow further if already indebted to the Union Government without the latter's consent,  this restriction is enshrined in Article 293, not Article 292. Article 292 primarily deals with the Union Government's borrowing powers.  The statement misattributes the constitutional provision governing this restriction on state borrowing.


**9. With reference to the  Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The MCC is a statutory provision under the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and its violation is a punishable offense.
2.  The MCC applies only to political parties and their candidates, not to the government in power or government employees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) is *not* a statutory provision. It is a set of guidelines laid down by the Election Commission of India in consultation with political parties to ensure free and fair elections. While violations can have consequences, they are not directly punishable under a specific statute.  The statement incorrectly presents the MCC as a legally binding statute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MCC applies to all political parties, their candidates, polling agents, the government in power, and all government employees during the election period.  Its scope is broad, encompassing all actors who could potentially influence the electoral process.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the MCC's applicability.


**10. With reference to Lok Sabha Elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lok Sabha elections are conducted on the basis of proportional representation, with each state allocated seats in proportion to its population.
2.  In a Lok Sabha constituency, the candidate who secures the highest number of votes is declared elected, even if they do not secure an absolute majority of the votes cast.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lok Sabha elections in India are conducted on the basis of *territorial* representation, not proportional representation. Each constituency elects one member, and the allocation of seats to states is based on their population, but the system is not strictly proportional.  The statement incorrectly describes the electoral system as proportional.

Statement 2 is correct.  In a Lok Sabha constituency, the candidate who secures the highest number of votes is declared elected, regardless of whether they have obtained an absolute majority of the votes cast.  This is the "first-past-the-post" system.  The statement accurately reflects the principle of election in Lok Sabha constituencies.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are exempted from the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but are bound by the principles of natural justice.
2.  Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases are heard by the High Court, and in civil cases by the District Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, are not strictly bound by the rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, they are still obligated to adhere to the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and impartiality in their proceedings.  This flexibility allows for a more accessible and less formal approach to dispute resolution at the village level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The jurisdiction of appellate courts for Gram Nyayalaya decisions differs.  Appeals in criminal cases from Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session, not the High Court.  Civil appeals go to the District Court.  The High Court does not directly hear appeals from Gram Nyayalayas. This distinction is crucial for understanding the hierarchical structure of the judicial system and the specific pathways for legal redress.  The statement incorrectly conflates the appellate jurisdiction for both civil and criminal cases.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court.
2.  The power to punish contempt of court is vested solely in the Supreme Court, as per Article 129 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, defines two main types of contempt: civil and criminal. Civil contempt arises from the willful disobedience of court orders, judgments, or decrees. Criminal contempt, on the other hand, encompasses actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court, prejudice judicial proceedings, or obstruct the administration of justice.  This distinction is vital for understanding the different types of actions that constitute contempt and the corresponding penalties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Article 129 grants the Supreme Court the power to punish for its own contempt, Article 215 extends a similar power to High Courts.  Both the Supreme Court and High Courts possess the inherent power to punish for contempt of their respective courts.  The statement incorrectly limits this power to the Supreme Court alone, overlooking the significant role of High Courts in maintaining the integrity of the judicial process within their jurisdictions.


**3. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) by exclusively focusing on Gram Sabhas.
2.  The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is utilized to identify thematic developmental gaps that are then addressed through a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society' approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan significantly emphasizes Gram Sabha participation, it's not solely focused on them.  The Abhiyan involves all three tiers of Panchayats – Gram, Block, and District –  with Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Block/District Sabhas also playing crucial roles in the PDP preparation process.  The statement wrongly restricts the scope of the Abhiyan's participatory approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) serves as a crucial tool for identifying thematic developmental gaps at the Panchayat level.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan leverages the PDI to guide the planning process, adopting a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society' approach to address these gaps comprehensively. This holistic approach emphasizes the collaborative efforts of various government agencies and civil society organizations in achieving sustainable development goals at the grassroots level.


**4. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their administration falls under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2.  The Station Commander of a Cantonment serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006,  their administration falls under the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the military nature of cantonments and their strategic importance.  The statement incorrectly assigns administrative responsibility to the wrong ministry.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This arrangement ensures military oversight and coordination within the cantonment area.  The dual role of the Station Commander highlights the unique administrative structure of cantonments, combining military and civilian governance.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2.  The ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess legislative powers on subjects such as land revenue collection and mineral extraction royalties but lack executive powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), specifically applies to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  It grants the Governor the power to create ADCs and ARCs within these states to address the unique needs and governance structures of tribal communities.  The statement accurately reflects the geographical scope of the Sixth Schedule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess not only legislative powers but also significant executive and even judicial powers in their respective areas.  They have the authority to make laws on various matters, including those related to land revenue, taxation, forest management, and mineral resources.  The statement erroneously restricts their powers to only the legislative domain.  Their extensive authority is designed to promote self-governance within tribal communities.


**6. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The process of forming new states in India requires a simple majority in both houses of Parliament.
2.  The President of India must recommend the introduction of a bill for the formation of a new state in Parliament.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The formation of new states in India, as per Article 3 of the Constitution, requires a special majority in both Houses of Parliament, not a simple majority.  This reflects the significance of altering the country's territorial boundaries and administrative structure.  The statement incorrectly simplifies the constitutional requirements.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that a bill for the formation of a new state can only be introduced in Parliament upon the recommendation of the President of India. This ensures that the executive branch plays a crucial role in initiating the process, considering its implications for national unity and governance.  The statement accurately reflects this crucial constitutional provision.


**7. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1.  iCAL is the first-of-its-kind institution in India established to audit the accounts of only Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs).
2.  iCAL's primary function includes capacity building for auditors to improve the financial performance assessment and service delivery of local governance bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While iCAL focuses on auditing local governance, it's not limited to PRIs. Its mandate extends to auditing all local governance bodies, including Urban Local Bodies (ULBs). The statement wrongly restricts iCAL's scope to only PRIs.

Statement 2 is correct.  A primary objective of iCAL is to enhance the capacity of local government auditors. This includes providing training and support to improve their skills in financial performance assessment and monitoring service delivery.  The statement correctly identifies a key function of iCAL in strengthening the auditing mechanisms at the local level.  This contributes to greater accountability and transparency in local governance.


**8. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are binding on both the Union and State governments regarding the distribution of tax revenue.
2.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of tax revenue among states based on criteria such as population and area, as recommended by the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations on the distribution of tax revenue are not legally binding.  While they carry significant weight and are generally followed, the Union and State governments retain the ultimate authority in deciding the allocation of resources. The statement incorrectly portrays the recommendations as legally binding.

Statement 2 is correct. Horizontal devolution is a key aspect of Fiscal Federalism in India.  It refers to the sharing of tax revenue among different states based on various criteria, including population, area, income distance, demographic performance, and forest cover. The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in determining these criteria and their weightage.  The statement accurately describes the concept of horizontal devolution.


**9. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provisions explicitly define the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission’s recommendations led to the discontinuation of the Special Category Status scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly define the criteria for granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states.  The criteria have evolved over time based on various factors like geographical disadvantages and socio-economic conditions.  The statement wrongly suggests the existence of explicit constitutional provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the Special Category Status (SCS) scheme was discontinued.  This led to a shift in the approach to providing financial assistance to states facing developmental challenges.  The statement accurately reflects this significant change in the fiscal federalism landscape.  The discontinuation of SCS does not mean that special assistance to states is no longer given, but the mechanism changed.


**10. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is solely applicable to commercial disputes.
2.  The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was established by the Ministry of Law and Justice to promote ADR mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is not limited to commercial disputes. It applies to a wide range of disputes, including civil, commercial, and even some family matters. The statement wrongly restricts the scope of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was constituted by the Supreme Court of India, not the Ministry of Law and Justice. The Supreme Court's role in establishing the MCPC underscores the judiciary's commitment to promoting ADR mechanisms.  The statement incorrectly attributes the establishment of the MCPC to the wrong entity.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1.  It was launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas."
2.  The campaign's primary aim is to enhance the participation of women in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, initially launched as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," commenced in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.  Its objective is to facilitate broader participation in the creation of Panchayat Development Plans.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to increase overall participation, it specifically emphasizes inclusive engagement across all segments of society, including women, youth, and the elderly.  It does not solely focus on women's participation.  The campaign's goal is to ensure a holistic and representative approach to PDP development, reflecting the needs and aspirations of the entire community.  The involvement of women is a crucial component but not the sole focus.


**2. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a committee of state finance ministers.
2.  Funding for all CSSs is directly transferred to states through the Consolidated Fund of India, bypassing state-level treasuries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current structure of CSSs is indeed based on the recommendations of a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers focusing on the rationalization of CSSs. This report guided the restructuring and streamlining of these schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the use of the Consolidated Fund of the State for CSS transfers, the statement implies a direct transfer from the Consolidated Fund of India, bypassing state-level mechanisms. This is not entirely accurate.  Although the central government's share is routed through the Consolidated Fund of India, it is then transferred to the states' Consolidated Funds for disbursement according to established procedures and subsequent release to implementing agencies.  The process involves state-level financial mechanisms.


**3. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), established in 2021, is integral to the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) which is also known as Mission Karmayogi.
2.  Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on training and development for senior civil servants holding leadership positions within the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The CBC, established in 2021, is a key component of the NPCSCB, commonly known as Mission Karmayogi.  It plays a crucial role in implementing the mission's capacity-building initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Mission Karmayogi's scope extends beyond senior civil servants. It encompasses capacity building for all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments of the Union Government.  The mission aims to enhance the professional development of the entire civil service workforce, not just those in leadership roles.


**4. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar metadata, including demographic details, can be retained indefinitely for national security purposes.
2. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act explicitly stated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, emphasizing data privacy concerns.  The exception is for national security, but this does not permit indefinite retention.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be compulsorily imposed for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  The government cannot force individuals to link Aadhaar to these services.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL was inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, and is the first such center globally.
2.  iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of local governance bodies on behalf of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While iCAL was indeed inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, and is the first of its kind in India, it is not the first globally. Similar institutions dedicated to improving local governance auditing exist in other countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors, aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  It focuses on capacity building and knowledge sharing, rather than directly conducting audits on behalf of the CAG. The CAG retains its own auditing mechanisms for local bodies.


**6. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule was implemented following the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. It grants autonomy to tribal areas within the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee's report shaped the provisions of the Sixth Schedule, which aim to grant significant autonomy to tribal areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), provides for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) in certain tribal-dominated areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. These councils have considerable power over local administration and resources, promoting self-governance.


**7.  With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) for states, consider the following statements:**

1. The granting of SCS is based on specific criteria enshrined in the Indian Constitution.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS designation ceased to exist.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While SCS was initially granted based on geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, the Constitution itself does not contain provisions for formally categorizing states as SCS.  The criteria were largely based on Finance Commission recommendations and evolved over time.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of the SCS designation.  While special funding continues for some states, it's no longer based on the formal SCS classification.  The current financial assistance provided to Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on other criteria and recommendations.


**8. With reference to the devolution of financial resources between the Union and States, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of divisible pool taxes for states, based on a formula that assigns equal weight to all factors.
2.  Grants-in-aid to states from the Union are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, the formula used was not based on equal weighting of all factors.  It assigned different weights to criteria such as income distance, area, population, demographic performance, forest cover, and tax efforts.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 275 of the Constitution explicitly empowers the Union government to provide grants-in-aid to states for specific purposes, particularly to address revenue shortfalls or development needs.


**9. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs were established as one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), along with digital connectivity and a national data center.
2. CSCs primarily focus on delivering government-to-government (G2G) services to citizens in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CSCs are indeed one of the three foundational elements of the NeGP, alongside digital connectivity and national/state data centers.  These three pillars were designed to improve citizen access to government services through a digital infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While CSCs do deliver government-to-citizen (G2C) services, their role extends beyond this.  They also facilitate business-to-citizen (B2C) services and offer various financial services, such as banking, insurance, and pension-related assistance.  The focus is on providing a broad range of services to rural citizens.


**10. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The bill establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee data protection compliance and resolve disputes.
2.  The bill prohibits the transfer of personal data outside India under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, establishes the DPBI as an independent authority responsible for monitoring compliance with data protection rules, imposing penalties, and addressing grievances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The bill allows for the transfer of personal data outside India, subject to certain conditions and restrictions.  The government retains the power to restrict transfers to specific countries based on data protection standards and other relevant considerations.  The bill does not impose an absolute ban on cross-border data transfers.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  It was launched in 2018 under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas" by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
2.  The Abhiyan exclusively focuses on Gram Panchayats and excludes Block and District Panchayats from its purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People's Plan Campaign (PPC), was indeed launched in 2018 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj under the name "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas."  Its aim is to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan encompasses all three tiers of Panchayats—Gram Panchayats, Block Panchayats, and District Panchayats—to ensure comprehensive and inclusive planning.  The structured meetings (Ward Sabha/Mahila Sabha/Gram Sabha/Block Sabha/District Sabha) are held at all levels to facilitate the preparation of development plans at each tier.  Therefore, the exclusion of Block and District Panchayats is factually inaccurate.  The Abhiyan aims for a holistic approach to development planning, not a limited one.


**2. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are exclusively funded by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed under the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers focusing on the rationalization of CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments. The funding pattern varies depending on the scheme and the state (e.g., 90:10 for some northeastern states, 60:40 for others).  The statement incorrectly asserts sole central funding and limits the implementation to sectors under the Union List, whereas they also encompass sectors in the State and Concurrent Lists.

Statement 2 is correct. The present structure of CSSs is indeed built upon the recommendations of a 2015 report produced by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, which focused on streamlining and rationalizing these schemes. This report significantly influenced the current design and functioning of CSSs.


**3. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional, citing violations of fundamental rights.
2.  Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* did *not* declare the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional. Instead, it upheld the constitutionality of the Act while simultaneously emphasizing the importance of privacy rights and placing limitations on the use of Aadhaar data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, the Supreme Court clarified that it cannot be compulsorily enforced for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  The Act's scope is not all-encompassing regarding government services.


**4. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Constitution of India explicitly outlines the criteria and process for granting SCS to states.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state currently holds this status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain any specific provision for designating states as Special Category States (SCS). The SCS designation arose from the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission and subsequent commissions, and is based on socio-economic and geographical considerations.  There is no constitutional basis for this classification.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the discontinuation of the SCS, and consequently, no state currently officially holds this status.  While some states receive special financial assistance due to their unique circumstances, this assistance is not based on the formal SCS designation.


**5. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., extends only to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court martial.
2.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to commute a death sentence but not to pardon a person sentenced to life imprisonment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, *including* those sentenced by a court-martial. The scope is broader than just court-martial cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to commute *any* sentence, including life imprisonment.  The President's power is comprehensive, covering various forms of sentence modification.


**6. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bill establishes the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to monitor compliance and impose penalties, but appeals against its decisions lie with the Supreme Court.
2.  The Bill mandates that all data fiduciaries must appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor, regardless of the volume or sensitivity of the data processed.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2023, does establish the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) with powers to monitor compliance and impose penalties, appeals against its decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bill differentiates between Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) and other data fiduciaries.  Only SDFs, based on factors like the volume and sensitivity of data processed and potential risks, are required to appoint a data protection officer and an independent data auditor.  The requirement is not universal for all data fiduciaries.


**7. With reference to the  Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act retains the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, alongside its new provisions.
2. The Act mandates that the Right of Way (RoW) for telecom infrastructure must be granted on a discriminatory and exclusive basis to ensure efficient network deployment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, *repeals* the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933,  to reflect advancements in the telecommunications sector and technology.  The older acts are no longer relevant or sufficient.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly states that the Right of Way (RoW) must be granted on a *non-discriminatory and non-exclusive* basis. This ensures fair access and avoids monopolistic control over infrastructure deployment.


**8. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are solely managed by the private sector and operate independently of government oversight.
2. CSCs offer services only to rural citizens and do not cater to urban populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While CSCs provide a platform for private sector engagement, they are overseen by the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), established under the Ministry of Electronics & IT.  They operate within a collaborative framework involving both the public and private sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSCs aim to provide services across India, including both rural and urban areas,  though their initial focus and impact have been more prominent in rural regions.  The network's goal is to ensure pan-India coverage.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, aims to solely accelerate the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26, bypassing the involvement of local communities.
2.  A key component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas at the village level to facilitate the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs), with a mandatory thematic approach strictly based on the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does aim to accelerate the preparation of PDPs for 2025-26, it explicitly emphasizes active people's participation.  The program involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, community-based organizations (CBOs), and other stakeholders at all three tiers of Panchayats.  The statement misrepresents the inclusive nature of the Abhiyan.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan does indeed utilize structured meetings at various levels (Ward Sabha, Mahila Sabha, Gram Sabha, etc.) to prepare development plans. However, it does not mandate a *strictly* thematic approach based solely on localized SDGs.  While the thematic approach is influenced by the SDGs, it is also informed by the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) and other local developmental needs, allowing for flexibility and a more holistic approach. The statement oversimplifies the multifaceted nature of the plan development process.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the auditing of local bodies in India:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly conducts the audits of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through a nationwide network of its own field offices, independent of any state-level agencies.
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is solely used for conducting online audits of panchayat accounts and is not integrated with other government systems for a comprehensive view of financial management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, the CAG doesn't directly conduct all audits.  The auditing is often carried out through Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level, working under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision. This is a crucial distinction, indicating a decentralized approach to auditing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The AuditOnline application is indeed used for online audits of panchayat accounts, enhancing accountability. However, the statement wrongly claims it's isolated.  The implication is that it lacks integration with other systems. In reality, its effectiveness is likely enhanced by integration with other government systems to provide a more holistic picture of financial management, although the exact extent of this integration is not specified in the provided text.


**3. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework for CSSs is entirely based on the 14th Finance Commission's report, which significantly altered the funding patterns and eliminated the distinction between Plan and Non-Plan expenditures.
2.  All financial transfers to states for CSSs are routed exclusively through the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring direct central government control over the disbursement of funds to the states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations significantly impacted CSSs (particularly by abolishing the Plan-Non Plan distinction), the current framework is also informed by the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).  The statement oversimplifies the evolution of the CSS framework, ignoring the influence of other crucial reports and committees.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that all transfers for CSSs are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India. This detail highlights the significant role of state governments in implementing and managing these schemes, despite the joint funding arrangement with the central government.  The statement incorrectly attributes direct central control over disbursement, overlooking the state's role.


**4. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi's capacity-building programs exclusively target officers of the All India Services (IAS, IPS, IFS, etc.), excluding contractual employees and staff from other government agencies.
2.  The 70-20-10 mandate within Mission Karmayogi dictates that 70% of learning should come from planned training programs, 20% from interactions with peers, and 10% from on-the-job experience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that Mission Karmayogi covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries, departments, and agencies of the Union Government.  The statement wrongly restricts the scope of the program to a specific cadre of officers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 70-20-10 mandate is correctly described in the text but the percentages are reversed in statement 2. The correct ratio is 70% from on-the-job experience and reflection, 20% from learning with others, and 10% from formal training. This inversion highlights a crucial detail that could easily be missed by a candidate who is not fully aware of the program's learning philosophy.


**5. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitution of India explicitly defines the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states, outlining specific socio-economic and geographical indicators that must be met.
2.  The allocation of funds to SCS states is currently based solely on the recommendations made by the 14th Finance Commission, eliminating any reliance on older formulas such as the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* contain any provision for categorizing states as "Special Category States". The criteria for granting SCS are not constitutionally enshrined but have evolved over time based on various factors.  The statement creates a false impression of constitutional basis for SCS.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS, the current special funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on recommendations from the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers and not solely on the 14th Finance Commission's report. The statement presents an oversimplified account of the complex funding mechanisms for these states.  The older Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, while no longer the primary basis for funding, still holds historical relevance and influences current understanding of the issue.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution:**

1. The Sixth Schedule grants the Governor of the respective states the power to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in areas inhabited by Scheduled Tribes, and not in areas predominantly populated by other communities.
2.  The ADCs and ARCs established under the Sixth Schedule have executive and legislative powers, but lack judicial powers, relying instead on the regular state judiciary for dispute resolution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs in the specified tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  The focus is on granting autonomy to tribal communities within these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess executive, legislative, *and* judicial powers within their respective jurisdictions. This is a key feature of their autonomy and self-governance.  The statement wrongly restricts their powers, omitting a significant aspect of their functional capacity.  They have their own judicial systems to handle local disputes.


**7. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar as a prerequisite for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile phone connections, irrespective of an individual's willingness to provide their Aadhaar details.
2.  The Supreme Court of India's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act explicitly prohibits the state from entering into contracts with private corporations for the sharing of Aadhaar data, citing infringement on the right to privacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment explicitly states that Aadhaar cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  The statement misrepresents a crucial aspect of the court's ruling, which protects individual choice regarding Aadhaar usage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's judgment clearly prohibits the state from contracting with private entities for Aadhaar data sharing, as this would violate the right to privacy.  This is a key element of the court's decision to uphold the right to privacy as a fundamental right.


**8. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM), consider the following statements:**

1. The Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances & Pensions (MoPPG&P)'s recent guidelines mandate that all grievances must be resolved within a maximum period of 7 days, significantly reducing the existing timeframe.
2. The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is designed and implemented by the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) to evaluate the performance of individual grievance officers within ministries and departments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The new guidelines reduce the timeframe to 21 days, not 7 days.  The statement significantly underestimates the stipulated time frame for grievance redressal, potentially misleading candidates.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GRAI is designed to rank Ministries/Departments, not individual grievance officers.  The statement misinterprets the scope and purpose of the GRAI. While individual officer performance indirectly contributes to the overall ministry ranking, the GRAI's focus is on the organizational performance of grievance redressal, not individual assessment.




**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign utilizes a thematic approach based on a localized interpretation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), employing a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" strategy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign), launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj as "Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas," directly aims to accelerate public involvement in the creation of PDPs for 2025-26.  This makes statement 1 accurate.  Furthermore, the campaign explicitly adopts a thematic approach, aligning the PDPs with localized versions of the SDGs. This is achieved through a collaborative "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" approach, making statement 2 correct as well.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first center of its kind in India, focused solely on auditing the financial performance of local bodies.
2. iCAL's primary function is to provide training to local government auditors, ensuring adherence to globally recognized auditing standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While iCAL is indeed the first of its kind in India and aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance, statement 1 is partially incorrect. Its scope extends beyond just financial performance assessment; it also focuses on service delivery and governance issues. Statement 2 is also partially incorrect.  Although capacity building for auditors is a key function, iCAL's role encompasses a broader objective of serving as a knowledge center and think tank for addressing grassroot governance challenges.  Therefore, neither statement fully captures the comprehensive nature of iCAL's mandate.


**3. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a sub-group of Chief Ministers, focusing on schemes contributing to the national development agenda.
2.  The funding pattern for core CSSs in the eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states is a 70:30 ratio, with the Centre contributing the larger share.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the current CSS framework's foundation in the 2015 report by the Chief Ministers' sub-group. The report aimed to streamline CSSs and concentrate on schemes vital to the national development agenda. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding ratio for core CSSs in the specified states is 90:10, not 70:30, with the Centre providing 90% of the funding.  This highlights a key difference in the financial distribution for these specific regions.


**4. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi, launched in 2021, aims to transform the Indian civil service into a more technologically proficient workforce, prioritizing digital skills training.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) is responsible for the implementation of Mission Karmayogi's training programs, focusing solely on the skill development of contractual employees within the Union Government.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is inaccurate in its emphasis on technological proficiency as the primary goal. While technological literacy is a component, Mission Karmayogi's broader aim is to cultivate a professional, well-trained civil service aligned with India's developmental aspirations.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The CBC is indeed involved in the implementation of Mission Karmayogi, but its scope extends to all civil servants, including both permanent and contractual employees, across various Union Government entities.  Therefore, both statements contain misleading or incomplete information.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, enacted in 1950, provides special provisions for the administration of tribal areas in the Northeastern states, based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2.  The Sixth Schedule grants autonomous district councils significant legislative and executive powers, including control over land and forest resources, but excludes judicial powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, stemming from Article 244(2) and the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, establishes a system of autonomous district councils to govern tribal areas in certain Northeastern states.  Statement 2 is also largely correct. The councils are vested with considerable legislative and executive powers, including substantial control over land and forests. While they don't have complete judicial independence, their powers extend to some aspects of justice administration within their jurisdiction. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Sixth Schedule.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS):**

1.  The grant of SCS is based on objective criteria defined in the Constitution, ensuring transparency and consistency in the selection process.
2.  States granted SCS receive enhanced financial assistance and other benefits, but this assistance is based on a pre-defined formula, ensuring equitable distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does not define specific criteria for granting SCS.  The decision is discretionary and based on factors like geographical disadvantages and socio-economic challenges. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While SCS states do receive additional financial support and benefits, there is no fixed formula for distribution. The assistance is often need-based and determined on a case-by-case basis. This makes the process less transparent and potentially less equitable than a formula-based system.  Thus, both statements misrepresent the reality of SCS allocation.


**7. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FCRA mandates that all NGOs receiving foreign funds must have a designated FCRA account in a specific branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi.
2.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA have increased the permissible limit for administrative expenses from 20% to 50% of the total foreign contribution received.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the FCRA's requirement for NGOs to maintain a designated FCRA account in a specified SBI branch in New Delhi for receiving foreign funds. This centralizes the management and tracking of foreign contributions.  Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2020 amendments actually *reduced* the permissible limit for administrative expenses from 50% to 20% of the total foreign contribution. This aimed to ensure a greater proportion of the funds is utilized for the intended purposes.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Post Office Act, 2023, introduces a new regulatory framework for the postal services, establishing the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) as the chief executive officer.
2.  The Act empowers the DGPS to issue regulations concerning postal charges, but not the supply and sale of postage stamps, as these are managed by a separate government agency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, establishes the DGPS as the head of India Post, granting them extensive regulatory authority. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act grants the DGPS the power to regulate various aspects of postal services, including the setting of charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps. This consolidates regulatory control under the DGPS.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**9.  Consider the following statements regarding the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. The Act mandates that spectrum allocation for specified purposes, including national security and disaster management, must be done through an auction process.
2. The Act explicitly regulates Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms, bringing them under the ambit of the new telecommunications regulatory framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act does utilize auctions for spectrum allocation, it allows for administrative allocation for specific purposes like national security and disaster management, diverging from a purely auction-based system.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Act does *not* regulate OTT platforms; it specifically excludes them from its regulatory purview. Therefore, both statements misrepresent key aspects of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.


**10. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar's random number generation process inherently includes demographic data like caste, religion, income, and health status.
2. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar's random number generation specifically *excludes* demographic details such as caste, religion, income, and health.  This protects the privacy of individuals. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment clarified that Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes but not for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  Therefore, both statements contain factual inaccuracies.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to commute a death sentence only if the conviction was by a court-martial.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to offences against any law relating to a matter under the executive power of the Union.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends,  including those sentenced to death by any court, not just court-martials.  The scope of Article 72 is broader than merely encompassing court-martial convictions.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 clearly states that the President's pardon power extends to offences against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends. This encompasses a wide range of offences under various Union laws.  This is a core component of the President's constitutional authority in this area.  The statement accurately reflects this constitutional provision.


**2. With reference to curative petitions in the Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed.
2. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions is explicitly mentioned in Article 142 of the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after all other legal avenues, including a review petition under Article 137, have been exhausted.  It's a mechanism to address exceptional situations where a miscarriage of justice is perceived even after the review petition is dismissed. The sequential process is crucial to the understanding of curative petitions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Article 142 empowers the Supreme Court to do complete justice, the specific power to hear curative petitions isn't explicitly laid down in the Article itself.  The power evolved through judicial pronouncements, drawing upon the inherent powers of the court under Article 142 to ensure justice, but it's not a direct provision of Article 142. The statement wrongly suggests a direct constitutional basis for curative petitions.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established under a state-sponsored scheme.
2. The Nirbhaya Fund exclusively finances FTSCs dealing with POCSO Act cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are established under a centrally sponsored scheme, not a state-sponsored one.  The initiative originates from the central government, with funding and implementation overseen at the national level, though the courts operate within states/UTs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Nirbhaya Fund contributes significantly to the funding of FTSCs, it doesn't exclusively finance courts handling POCSO Act cases.  The fund supports the overall functioning of FTSCs, which encompass various cases related to sexual offenses, including those under the POCSO Act.  The statement creates a false impression of exclusive funding for a specific subset of FTSC cases.


**4. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are exempt from following the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, except in cases involving appeals.
2. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas in criminal cases go to the High Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the stringent rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but they are guided by the principles of natural justice. This makes their proceedings more flexible and accessible at the village level. However, this principle applies to original proceedings and not necessarily appeals.  The flexibility is a key feature of their design.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals in criminal cases from Gram Nyayalayas go to the Court of Session, not directly to the High Court.  The statement misrepresents the appellate hierarchy for such cases. The appellate process is designed to ensure a layer of review before reaching higher courts.


**5. With reference to contempt of court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves scandalizing the court.
2. The power to punish contempt of court is derived from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, and not directly from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Civil contempt focuses on the willful disobedience of court orders, decrees, or processes, while criminal contempt involves actions like scandalizing or lowering the authority of the court or obstructing the administration of justice.  The distinction is crucial in understanding the nature and consequences of different types of contempt.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the framework for dealing with contempt, the inherent power of the Supreme Court (Article 129) and High Courts (Article 215) to punish contempt is constitutionally rooted. The Act supplements, but doesn't replace, the constitutional power. The statement incorrectly minimizes the constitutional foundation of the power to punish contempt.


**6. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants to SCS until the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly define or provide for the categorization of states as Special Category States.  The SCS status is a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.  The statement misrepresents the constitutional basis (or lack thereof) for the SCS designation.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the basis for determining grants to SCS until the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of the SCS category and a revised funding mechanism.  The statement accurately reflects the historical practice regarding financial allocations to SCS.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule was included in the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule applies only to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, which deals with the administration of tribal areas in certain states, was indeed incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee. This committee's work was instrumental in shaping the provisions related to tribal governance in these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Sixth Schedule does apply to Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura, it also applies to Mizoram. The statement is incomplete and therefore inaccurate in its description of the geographical scope of the Sixth Schedule.  The precise states covered are a crucial aspect to understanding the schedule's application.


**8. With reference to the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2021, allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards only if the arbitration agreement was obtained through fraud or corruption.
2. The Mediation Act, 2023, defines mediation to include pre-litigation mediation but excludes online mediation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 2021 amendment allows for an unconditional stay of enforcement of arbitral awards if there's evidence of fraud or corruption in the agreement or award itself.  This is a significant change aimed at ensuring fairness and preventing the enforcement of potentially illegitimate awards.  The conditionality of the stay is a key element.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Mediation Act, 2023, explicitly includes online mediation within its definition of mediation. This reflects the growing importance of technology in dispute resolution.  The statement inaccurately excludes a key aspect of the act's scope.  The inclusion of online mediation is significant for its modern application.


**9. With reference to the devolution of funds between the Union and States, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended that 41% of the divisible pool of taxes be devolved to the States.
2.  Grants-in-aid to States are provided under Article 270 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendation for a 41% devolution of the divisible pool to the states is a key aspect of India's fiscal federalism. This recommendation significantly impacts the financial resources available to state governments.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Grants-in-aid to states are provided under Article 275, not Article 270. Article 270 deals with the distribution of taxes between the Union and the States.  The statement confuses the constitutional basis for two distinct aspects of intergovernmental financial transfers.  The distinction between the articles is vital for understanding the legal basis of financial transfers.


**10. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs became the primary mode of specific purpose transfers from the Union to the States.
2.  The funding pattern for core CSSs is uniformly 60:40 (Centre:State) across all states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction led to CSSs becoming the predominant mechanism for central government transfers to states for specific purposes. This change in the fiscal framework significantly altered the nature of intergovernmental financial relations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding pattern for core CSSs is *not* uniformly 60:40 across all states.  There are variations, particularly for the North Eastern and Himalayan states, where the funding ratio is often different (e.g., 90:10). The statement falsely presents a uniform funding pattern across all states, neglecting the crucial variations based on geographical and developmental considerations.


**1. With reference to Indian Passports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Central government can exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement.
2.  Only Indian citizens are eligible to receive Indian passports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Passport Act allows the Central government to exempt specific individuals from the need to possess a passport, based on its discretion. This is often done for humanitarian reasons or in situations where a passport is not practically necessary.  This flexibility reflects a pragmatic approach to passport regulations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that the Central Government *may* issue a passport to a non-citizen if deemed necessary in the public interest. This demonstrates that Indian passports are not exclusively limited to Indian citizens.  The issuance to non-citizens is exceptional and conditional, but it is a possibility under the law.  This exception is important for international relations and diplomatic purposes.


**2. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on providing services to urban populations.
2. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a private entity established under the Companies Act, 1956.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that CSCs are front-end delivery points for services to *rural* citizens of India. Their focus is explicitly on bridging the digital divide and providing access to essential services in rural areas, highlighting the government's commitment to inclusive development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CSC SPV is indeed established under the Companies Act, 1956, it is explicitly stated to be set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT. This makes it a government-affiliated entity, not a purely private one. The government's involvement underscores its role in overseeing and coordinating the implementation of the CSC scheme.  The SPV acts as a crucial link between the government's policy goals and the practical delivery of services through the CSC network.


**3. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 improved compared to the previous year.
2.  The WPFI 2024 was released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that India ranked 159th out of 180 countries.  It does not provide information about previous years' rankings, therefore no comparison can be made.  The ranking itself signals concerns about press freedom in India, highlighting the need for further improvements in this crucial area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPFI 2024 is explicitly attributed to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a leading NGO dedicated to press freedom, not UNESCO.  The fact that an NGO, rather than a UN body, produces the index underscores the independent nature of the assessment and its focus on advocacy for press freedom.


**4. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The CBI is a constitutional body established by the Constitution of India.
2. The Director of the CBI is selected by a panel consisting of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CBI is explicitly described as a *non-statutory* and *non-constitutional* body. It operates under the Delhi Special Police Establishment (DSPE) Act, 1946, indicating its legal basis is legislative, not constitutional. This distinction has implications for its powers and accountability.

Statement 2 is correct. The selection process of the CBI Director is accurately described in the text. The involvement of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, and Chief Justice of India underscores the importance of maintaining a balance of power and ensuring the independence of the investigation agency. This process aims to safeguard the CBI from political influence and maintain its integrity as an investigative body.


**5. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRMs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole designated agency handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  CPGRAMS is an offline platform for lodging grievances with public authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions *two* designated nodal agencies in the Union Government for handling grievances: DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat.  The existence of two agencies indicates a division of responsibilities and a system of checks and balances, aimed at improving efficiency and effectiveness in grievance redressal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is clearly described as an *online* platform available 24/7 for lodging grievances. The online nature of the platform reflects the government's effort to leverage technology for improved accessibility and efficiency in grievance handling.


**6. With reference to the Co-Districts Initiative in Assam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Co-Districts Initiative replaces the existing system of districts in Assam.
2.  The initiative aims to enhance governance and provide citizen-centric services at a more local level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text emphasizes that the Co-Districts Initiative is a *new* administrative layer introduced *within* the existing district administration, not a replacement of the district system.  This approach suggests a strategy of decentralization rather than a complete overhaul of the administrative structure.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the initiative aims to decentralize administration, improve governance, and bring services closer to the people.  This focus on citizen-centric service delivery is a key objective of the initiative, reflecting a commitment to improving the reach and effectiveness of government services.


**7. With reference to the iCAL initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is an initiative to establish global standards for auditing central government bodies.
2. iCAL acts as a knowledge centre and think-tank for addressing governance issues at the grassroot levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing *local* governance bodies, not central government bodies. The focus on local governance highlights the importance of ensuring accountability and transparency at the grassroot level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text accurately describes iCAL's role as a knowledge centre and think-tank for addressing governance issues at the grassroot level. This function is crucial for improving the quality of governance and promoting good practices at the local level.


**8. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a constitutional provision explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2. Violations of the MCC are directly punishable under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the MCC is *not* explicitly mentioned in the Constitution, although the Election Commission's authority derives from Article 324.  The MCC's non-constitutional status means it relies on political consensus and convention, rather than legal compulsion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explains that the MCC lacks statutory backing, meaning violations are not directly punishable under the IPC.  While violations can lead to action under other relevant laws (like the Representation of the People Act), there is no specific provision within the IPC for MCC violations.  This aspect highlights the limitations of the MCC in enforcing its provisions.


**9. With reference to Lok Sabha Elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Lok Sabha elections employ a system of proportional representation.
2.  In Lok Sabha elections, each constituency elects multiple representatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly describes Lok Sabha elections as employing a system of *territorial representation*, not proportional representation.  Territorial representation means each constituency elects a single representative, unlike proportional representation where seats are allocated based on the overall vote share.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clarifies that Lok Sabha elections use a system of *single-member constituencies*, meaning only one representative is elected from each constituency. This system contrasts with multi-member constituencies, where multiple representatives are elected from a single area.


**10. With reference to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS), consider the following statements:**

1. The BNS replaces the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC).
2.  The BNS introduces provisions for mandatory forensic investigation for all types of offences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BNS replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC), not the IPC.  The IPC remains in effect, defining the various offenses, while the CrPC outlines the procedures for investigation and prosecution. The distinction is important for understanding the scope and purpose of each legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BNS mandates forensic investigation only for offenses punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment.  This limited scope indicates a focus on prioritizing forensic resources for more serious crimes.


**11. With reference to the Union-State financial relations in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the states.
2.  The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations for vertical devolution were based solely on population data.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the *Union*, not the states.  The Union collects major taxes and shares the revenue with the states based on the Finance Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission's recommendations for vertical devolution were based on multiple criteria, including income distance, area, population (2011), demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  The multi-faceted approach reflects the complexity of determining a fair distribution of resources among the states.


**12. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. SCS is granted to states that demonstrate high levels of economic development.
2.  The concept of SCS was first introduced in the 1990s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SCS is granted to states facing geographical and socio-economic *disadvantages*, not those demonstrating high economic development.  The purpose of SCS is to provide additional assistance to states that need it most for development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The concept of SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission.  The early introduction of SCS reflects the government's recognition of regional disparities and the need for targeted development strategies.


**13. With reference to the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), consider the following statements:**

1. RTBF is an absolute right recognized in Indian law.
2. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 explicitly includes the right to be forgotten.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court recognized RTBF as part of the right to life under Article 21, it is not considered an absolute right.  The limitations on RTBF reflect the need to balance individual privacy with other important considerations, such as public interest and freedom of expression.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* mention the right to be forgotten.  The absence of explicit mention highlights the ongoing debate and complexities surrounding the implementation of RTBF in Indian law.


**14. With reference to Inner Line Permits (ILPs), consider the following statements:**

1. ILPs are issued only to non-Indian citizens.
2.  The ILP system is primarily used to protect tribal cultures in Northeast India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ILPs are issued to *Indian* citizens allowing them to travel into protected areas.  The restriction on movement is intended to regulate access to specific areas, not to exclude Indian citizens entirely.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text correctly identifies that the ILP system aims to regulate movement near international borders *and* protect tribal cultures in Northeast India.  This dual purpose highlights the complex considerations involved in managing border security and preserving indigenous cultures.


**15. With reference to the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges, consider the following statements:**

1. The Committee of Privileges of Rajya Sabha consists of members nominated by the Prime Minister.
2. The Committee investigates breaches of parliamentary privileges, which are special rights and immunities granted to Parliament and its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The members of the Rajya Sabha Committee of Privileges are nominated by the *Rajya Sabha Chairman*, not the Prime Minister.  This nomination process ensures that the committee's composition is independent of executive influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The committee's function is accurately described in the text.  The existence of parliamentary privileges is essential for the effective functioning of Parliament and the protection of its members' ability to perform their duties without undue interference.


**16. With reference to the Union Cabinet Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. Cabinet Committees are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2.  Only Cabinet Ministers can be members of Cabinet Committees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clarifies that Cabinet Committees are *extra-constitutional*, meaning they are not mentioned in the Constitution.  Their creation reflects the government's need for a flexible mechanism to address complex issues and streamline decision-making.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that while Cabinet Committees *usually* include only Cabinet Ministers, non-Cabinet Ministers are not barred from membership.  This flexibility allows the government to draw on expertise from across the ministerial structure.



**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Central government can exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement, and it may issue passports to non-Indian citizens if deemed necessary for public interest.
2.  India issues only two classes of passports: Ordinary (blue) and Diplomatic (white).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Indian Passport Act allows the Central government discretion to exempt individuals from passport requirements based on specific circumstances and also permits issuing passports to non-citizens in the interest of the nation's welfare. This reflects the government's authority to manage its international relations and national security.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While ordinary (blue) and diplomatic (white) passports are common, India also issues official (maroon) passports for government officials on official business.  The omission of this category makes the statement factually inaccurate.  The existence of three passport classes is a crucial detail in understanding the nuances of Indian passport issuance.


**2. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a state-level initiative established under the State Companies Act, aiming to establish CSCs as primary service delivery points for state government services.
2. CSCs primarily offer G2C services, excluding B2C and financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSC SPV is a central government initiative, established under the Companies Act, 1956 by the Ministry of Electronics & IT.  It operates at the national level, not just within individual states. Its objective extends beyond state government services; it aims to provide a broad range of services from government, private and social sectors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CSCs provide a wide array of services, including G2C (Government-to-Citizen), B2C (Business-to-Citizen) and financial services.  The statement's limitation of services to only G2C is a significant oversimplification of the CSC's role.  The comprehensive nature of the services offered is vital to understanding the CSC's significance in bridging the digital divide.


**3. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, are the only two designated nodal agencies at the state level for handling grievances.
2. CPGRAMS is a state-level online platform for lodging grievances, directly connecting citizens to state-level public authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat are crucial nodal agencies at the central level, the handling of grievances also involves mechanisms at the state and district levels.  District Magistrates often serve as District Public Grievance Officers, and some states have established their own grievance mechanisms. The statement inaccurately restricts grievance handling to only two central agencies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is a central government portal, not a state-level one. It connects citizens to ministries/departments at the national level, not just state authorities.  The statement misrepresents the scope and reach of the CPGRAMS platform.  Understanding the hierarchical structure of grievance redressal is crucial.


**4. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of funds amongst various states based on criteria like income distance, area, and population.
2.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, with the current share for states standing at 51% based on the 15th FC recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes transferred from the Union to the states. Horizontal devolution is the distribution of funds *amongst* states based on criteria like income distance, area, population etc. The statement confuses these two crucial aspects of fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Finance Commission does indeed recommend the distribution of Union taxes, the current share for states is 41%, not 51%, as per the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations. This difference of 10% is significant in understanding the distribution of resources between the Union and States.  Accurate figures are essential for analyzing fiscal federalism.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  SCS is granted to states facing geographical and socio-economic disadvantages, based on the recommendations of the Planning Commission.
2.  Initially, only Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were granted SCS in 1969, with no other states receiving this status subsequently.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SCS is granted based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission, not the Planning Commission. This distinction highlights the role of fiscal considerations in granting this special status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Jammu & Kashmir, Assam, and Nagaland were among the first recipients of SCS in 1969, other states have also received this status subsequently. The statement's assertion that no other states received SCS later is a significant factual error.  A complete understanding of SCS requires knowing the evolution of its application to various states.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, was enacted in October 2005 and replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.
2. The Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P) is the coordinating agency for the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Personnel and Training under MoPPG&P serves as the coordinating agency for the RTI Act. This highlights the central government's role in overseeing the implementation of this crucial transparency law.


**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs primarily focus on schemes included in the National Development Agenda for realizing Vision 2030.
2.  The funding pattern for core schemes is 90:10 (Centre:State) for all states, except Union Territories without legislatures, which receive 100% central funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs focus on schemes in the National Development Agenda to realize Vision 2022, not Vision 2030.  The specific year is a significant detail in understanding the scheme's time frame.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Union Territories without legislatures receive 100% central funding, the funding pattern for core schemes varies.  It's 90:10 for 8 North Eastern States and 3 Himalayan States, but 60:40 for other states.  The statement's simplification of the funding pattern is inaccurate.  The nuanced funding structure is important to understanding the financial dynamics of CSSs.


**8.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi aims to create a civil service based on rule-based training and capacity building.
2. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) was established in 2020 as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi aims to shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building. This crucial distinction highlights the change in approach towards civil service development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBC was launched in 2021, not 2020, as part of NPCSCB – Mission Karmayogi.  The year is important for understanding the timeline of this significant initiative.


**9. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. India ranked 160 out of 180 countries in the WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
2. The WPFI 2024 was released on World Press Freedom Day (May 3) and focused on the theme: “Journalism in the face of the Economic Crisis”.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's rank in the WPFI 2024 was 159, not 160.  This small numerical difference is significant for precise ranking information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the WPFI 2024 was indeed released on World Press Freedom Day (May 3), its theme was “A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis,” not the economic crisis.  The specific theme is essential for understanding the index's focus.


**10. With reference to the Co-Districts Initiative in Assam, consider the following statements:**

1. The Co-Districts Initiative replaces the existing system of districts with smaller administrative units headed by officers of the rank of Deputy District Commissioner.
2. The initiative aims to enhance governance and provide citizen-centric services by decentralizing administration and bringing services closer to the people.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Co-Districts Initiative creates smaller administrative units *within* existing districts, not replacing them entirely.  These units are headed by Assistant District Commissioners, not Deputy District Commissioners.  The precise rank and the relationship to the existing district structure are crucial distinctions.

Statement 2 is correct. The initiative aims to improve governance and citizen services through decentralization and enhanced accessibility.  This represents a key objective of the initiative.


**11. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is the second centre of its kind in India, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2. iCAL serves as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors, focusing primarily on the financial performance assessment of local bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL is the *first* such center in India, not the second.  The uniqueness of this initiative is a key fact to remember.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While iCAL does focus on financial performance assessment, its scope extends to broader aspects of governance and service delivery.  It also serves as a capacity-building center for auditors.  The statement's narrow focus on financial aspects is an oversimplification.


**12. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2019 by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26.
2. The campaign utilizes a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and employs the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to assess panchayat development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018 (initially as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas'), not 2019.  The year is a crucial piece of information.

Statement 2 is correct.  The campaign uses a thematic approach based on localized SDGs and utilizes the PDI to assess panchayat progress.  This highlights the campaign's methodology.


**13. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the auditing of local bodies through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in all states.
2.  The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Rural Development, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAG's authority over the auditing of local bodies is exercised through ELFAs/DLFAs in most states.  This highlights the hierarchical auditing structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AuditOnline application was developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The correct ministry is important for attribution.


**14. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA prohibit NGOs from receiving foreign funds for any purpose.
2.  NGOs are required to have a designated FCRA account in any branch of State Bank of India to receive foreign funds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA do not completely prohibit receiving foreign funds; they require prior permission and adherence to regulations.  The statement misrepresents the extent of the restrictions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The designated FCRA account must be in specific branches of State Bank of India in New Delhi, not just any branch.  This detail is important for understanding the regulatory requirements.


**15. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Post Office Act, 2023, repeals the Indian Post Office Act, 1998, and introduces a new regulatory framework for postal services in India.
2. The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) will have the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services, but not on the supply and sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, indeed replaces the 1998 Act, establishing a new regulatory structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The DGPS will have the power to regulate charges for services *and* the supply and sale of postage stamps. The statement mistakenly limits the DGPS's authority.


**1. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, aims to establish national standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2. iCAL functions as a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors, primarily focused on enhancing the financial independence of local government auditors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL aims to set *global*, not national, standards for auditing local governance bodies.  The text explicitly states its goal is to set global standards, implying a reach beyond just India's national boundaries.  The focus on international best practices and the potential for collaboration with international auditing bodies suggests a broader ambition than simply setting national standards.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While iCAL does serve as a collaborative platform and aims to improve financial performance assessment and service delivery, its primary focus is not on enhancing the *financial* independence of local government auditors. The text highlights its role in capacity building and knowledge sharing to improve governance at the grassroots level.  Improving the efficiency and effectiveness of audits is the goal, not necessarily increasing the financial autonomy of auditors themselves.  The emphasis is on improved accountability and transparency, not necessarily financial independence.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the AuditOnline application:**

1. Developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj in 2020, AuditOnline conducts online audits of panchayat accounts to ensure the accountability of fund utilization at the grassroots level.
2. AuditOnline's primary function is to provide technical guidance and supervision to the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) and Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text clearly states that the Ministry of Panchayati Raj developed AuditOnline in 2020 for online auditing of panchayat accounts to enhance accountability in fund utilization.  This aligns directly with the application's stated purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  AuditOnline's role is not to provide technical guidance and supervision to ELFAs and DLFAs.  That function is performed by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG), as explicitly stated in the text. AuditOnline is a tool to facilitate the audit process, not a supervisory body over existing audit mechanisms.  The two are distinct and complementary systems.


**3. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG)'s role in auditing local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG's authority to audit local bodies stems from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, and is exercised directly through the CAG's office in each state.
2.  The CAG's oversight of local body audits encompasses all three tiers of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs), primarily focusing on the utilization of funds provided by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG's authority originates from the 1971 Act, the audit is not directly carried out by the CAG's office in each state. The text clarifies that it is often done through ELFAs or DLFAs, which operate under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision. This indicates a decentralized approach rather than direct, state-level CAG involvement.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The CAG's audit covers all three tiers of PRIs and ULBs, but the primary focus is not solely on central government funds.  The audit encompasses the utilization of funds granted by *state* governments to local bodies, as the text clearly specifies.  This is a crucial distinction, highlighting the state's significant role in funding local governance.


**4. With reference to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992, consider the following statements:**

1. These amendments primarily focused on decentralizing power to local bodies, but did not include any provisions for auditing mechanisms for local self-governance.
2. The amendments laid the foundation for the current framework of local self-governance in India, but the detailed mechanisms for auditing local bodies were developed and implemented subsequently.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd and 74th Amendments of 1992 were instrumental in establishing the framework for local self-governance in India, and they *do* indirectly lay the groundwork for auditing mechanisms. While they don't detail specific auditing procedures, the establishment of local bodies necessitates the need for accountability and financial oversight, which implicitly calls for auditing systems.

Statement 2 is correct. The amendments provided the constitutional basis for local self-governance.  However, the specific mechanisms for auditing these bodies, such as the roles of the CAG, ELFAs, DLFAs, and later initiatives like AuditOnline and iCAL, were developed and implemented *after* the constitutional amendments.  The amendments created the need, and subsequent legislation and policies filled the details.


**5. With reference to the Capacity Building Commission (CBC) and Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 2021 as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), the CBC's primary mandate is to implement competency-based training programs for all contractual employees in the Union Government.
2. Mission Karmayogi's guiding principles advocate for a shift from rule-based to role-based training, emphasizing a competency-driven approach to capacity development for all civil servants, including contractual employees.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CBC was launched in 2021 as part of NPCSCB, its mandate is broader than just implementing competency-based training for contractual employees.  The text mentions that NPCSCB covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various Union Government entities.  The CBC's role is to facilitate capacity building for this entire group, not just contractual employees.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mission Karmayogi's core principles clearly advocate for a shift from rule-based to role-based training and a competency-driven approach to capacity development.  This is a key element of the program's reform agenda for the civil service.  The text explicitly mentions these principles as guiding the mission.


**6. Consider the following statements concerning the funding pattern of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs):**

1.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, along with the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017, led to CSSs becoming the primary mode of specific purpose transfers from the Union to the States, with all transfers routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.
2. For core CSS schemes, the Centre:State funding ratio is uniformly 60:40 for all states, irrespective of their geographical location or developmental needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction, CSSs became the primary method of specific purpose transfers from the Union to the States. It also confirms that all transfers are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the State.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding pattern for core CSS schemes is *not* uniform across all states.  The text clearly indicates a differential funding ratio: 90:10 for eight Northeastern and three Himalayan states and 60:40 for other states. This differentiation reflects the varying developmental needs and priorities of different regions.  The assumption of a uniform ratio is a significant misconception.


**7. With reference to the  People’s Plan Campaign (Jan Yojana Abhiyan), consider the following statements:**

1. Launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas', the Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26, focusing on a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  The campaign involves structured Gram Sabhas, Block Sabhas, and District Sabhas at all three tiers of Panchayats, excluding the participation of Self Help Groups (SHGs) and other community-based organizations (CBOs) to ensure the purity of the planning process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas', aims to increase public participation in PDP preparation for 2025-26.  It also highlights the thematic approach based on localized SDGs.  All this aligns with the campaign's stated objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions the active involvement of elected representatives, government frontline workers, *CBOs* (including SHGs), and other stakeholders in the implementation of the campaign.  Excluding these groups would contradict the campaign's stated aim of inclusive participation.  The emphasis on a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach" further reinforces the importance of diverse participation.


**8. With reference to the Passport Act, 1920, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that every Indian citizen must possess a passport for travel outside India, with no exceptions permitted by the Central Government.
2.  The Act empowers the Central Government to issue passports to non-Indian citizens if deemed necessary in the public interest, while also allowing the government to exempt certain Indian citizens from the passport requirement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Passport Act does not mandate that *every* Indian citizen must possess a passport for foreign travel. The text specifically mentions that the Central Government can exempt certain individuals from this requirement.  This flexibility is crucial for various circumstances and policy considerations.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Central Government has the power to issue passports to non-citizens in the public interest and can also exempt specific Indian citizens from the need for a passport.  This reflects the nuanced application of passport regulations.


**9. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. Established under the Companies Act, 1956, the CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) oversees the implementation of the CSC scheme, aiming to develop CSCs as a reliable and ubiquitous network of IT-enabled citizen service points across urban areas.
2. CSCs form one of the three pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), with the other two pillars being connectivity and the establishment of national data banks/state data centres.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CSC SPV was indeed set up under the Companies Act, 1956, and aims to develop CSCs as a reliable IT-enabled network, its focus is not limited to urban areas. The text emphasizes that CSCs are designed to serve *rural* citizens of India. The goal is to bridge the digital divide and provide access to services in underserved regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly identifies CSCs as one of the three pillars of the NeGP, alongside connectivity and national data banks/state data centres.  This establishes the program's strategic role within the broader national e-governance framework.


**10. With reference to the Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee are constituted solely from members of the Lok Sabha, with no representation from the Rajya Sabha.
2. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL) reviews the progress of Hindi usage in the Union government's official work, and its members are elected through a proportional representation system using a single transferable vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PAC includes members from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha (15 from Lok Sabha and 7 from Rajya Sabha), not solely from the Lok Sabha.  The mixed representation ensures broader representation and perspective.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the PCOL reviews the progress of Hindi's use in the Union government and that its members are elected using proportional representation with a single transferable vote.  This accurately describes the committee's composition and election process.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. The Act repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, primarily due to advancements in technology and the need for a more comprehensive regulatory framework.
2.  The Act introduces a new framework for spectrum allocation, prioritizing auctions for most purposes but allowing for administrative allocation in specific cases, such as national security and disaster management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, indeed repeals the outdated Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933. These older acts were inadequate to address the complexities of the modern telecommunications sector, which has seen dramatic technological advancements. The new Act aims to provide a more comprehensive and adaptable regulatory framework for the rapidly evolving digital landscape.  The obsolescence of the older acts is a key reason for their replacement.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act introduces a significant shift in spectrum allocation. While auctions remain the primary method, it acknowledges the need for administrative allocation in specific situations crucial for national interest.  This approach allows the government to allocate spectrum for critical services like national security, disaster management, and weather forecasting without the lengthy and potentially disruptive processes of an auction.  This is a departure from previous solely auction-based systems and aligns with international best practices.  The balance between auction and administrative allocation reflects a pragmatic approach to spectrum management.


**2. With reference to internet shutdowns in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017,  allow for internet shutdowns for durations exceeding 15 days, contingent upon the approval of a high-level review committee.
2. The Supreme Court's judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* emphasized that restrictions on internet access must adhere to the principles enshrined in Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees freedom of speech and expression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, stipulate that internet shutdowns can only be implemented for a maximum period of 15 days at a time.  While extensions are theoretically possible, they necessitate renewed justification and review. The statement incorrectly suggests unlimited duration. The Rules, while allowing for temporary suspension, do have built-in limitations regarding duration.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's landmark judgement in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India* unequivocally affirmed that the freedom of speech and expression extends to the internet.  Any restriction on internet access, including shutdowns, must therefore comply with the provisions of Article 19(2) of the Constitution, which allows for reasonable restrictions on this fundamental right only in the interests of public order, security, etc. The judgement underscores the importance of adhering to due process and proportionality in imposing such restrictions.


**3. With reference to the Public Examination (Prevention of Unfair Means) Act, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines "unfair means" broadly to encompass activities like unauthorized access to question papers, assisting candidates during examinations, and tampering with computer networks, but excludes the dissemination of leaked answers through unofficial channels.
2.  Penalties under the Act include imprisonment and substantial fines for individuals engaging in unfair means, with significantly higher penalties for service providers or those involved in organized crime related to examination irregularities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act's definition of "unfair means" is intentionally broad, aiming to cover a wide range of actions that compromise the integrity of public examinations.  This would absolutely include the dissemination of leaked answers, whether through unofficial channels or otherwise, as it undermines the fairness and equity of the examination process. The statement inaccurately limits the scope of the definition.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act outlines a clear and tiered penalty structure. Individuals resorting to unfair means face imprisonment and significant fines.  Critically, the penalties are substantially escalated for service providers or those involved in organized crime related to exam irregularities. This reflects the seriousness with which the legislation views such large-scale, systemic breaches of examination integrity. The differential penalties aim to deter both individual cheating and organized criminal activity.


**4. With reference to the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. Section 531(1) of the Sanhita establishes the legal framework for registering Zero FIRs, a provision that allows for the registration of a First Information Report irrespective of the location of the crime, facilitating immediate action and ensuring victim-centric procedures.
2. The concept of Zero FIR is based on the recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee, which was formed in response to the 2012 Nirbhaya case to address concerns about the effectiveness of existing legal frameworks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, explicitly allows for the registration of Zero FIRs. This provision is a significant step towards streamlining the reporting process for crimes, particularly those involving vulnerable populations. By allowing the registration of a complaint at any police station, regardless of jurisdiction, it ensures that victims do not face unnecessary delays or bureaucratic hurdles in reporting crimes.  This victim-centric approach is a key feature of the provision.

Statement 2 is also correct. The establishment of the Zero FIR mechanism is directly linked to the recommendations of the Justice Verma Committee. This committee was established in the wake of the 2012 Nirbhaya gang rape case, which highlighted significant shortcomings in the existing legal and investigative processes related to sexual assault cases.  The committee's recommendations aimed at improving victim support and enhancing the efficiency of investigations, and the Zero FIR provision reflects this commitment to reform.


**5. With reference to the Doctrine of Coverture, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Doctrine of Coverture, originating from English common law, treated married women as legal entities separate from their husbands, with full control over their property and the ability to enter into contracts independently.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) highlighted the outdated nature of the Doctrine of Coverture and its incompatibility with modern principles of gender equality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture, a relic of English common law, did *not* treat married women as separate legal entities. Instead, it subsumed the legal identity of a married woman under that of her husband. This meant that women essentially lost their legal standing after marriage, with their husbands having control over their property and the ability to enter into contracts on their behalf. The statement misrepresents the core principle of the doctrine.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) was pivotal in challenging the continuing influence of the Doctrine of Coverture in Indian law. The court explicitly acknowledged the discriminatory nature of the doctrine and its incompatibility with contemporary notions of gender equality and the fundamental rights of women. The case underscored the need to dismantle legal frameworks rooted in outdated patriarchal notions.  The Supreme Court's judgement effectively marked a significant shift away from the Doctrine's influence.


**6.  With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anti-Defection Law, introduced through the 52nd Amendment Act, 1985, prevents Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) from changing their party affiliation after election but does not apply to Members of Parliament (MPs).
2.  The law provides for disqualification of members who vote or abstain from voting in the legislature contrary to their party's directives, unless such action is condoned by the party within a stipulated timeframe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anti-Defection Law applies to both Members of Legislative Assemblies (MLAs) and Members of Parliament (MPs). It aims to curb the practice of defection, which undermines the stability of governments and the mandate of the electorate.  The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of the law's application.

Statement 2 is correct. A key provision of the Anti-Defection Law pertains to voting behavior.  Members who vote or abstain from voting in the legislature against their party's directives are subject to disqualification, unless their actions are explicitly condoned by the party leadership within a specified period (usually 15 days). This provision is designed to maintain party discipline and prevent opportunistic shifts in political allegiances.


**7. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, expanding the scope of access to information and strengthening the mechanisms for citizens to seek information from public authorities.
2. The Supreme Court's decision in *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* established the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution, paving the way for the enactment of the RTI Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002.  While the 2002 Act made a significant initial step towards transparency, the 2005 Act significantly broadened the scope of access to information, strengthened enforcement mechanisms, and made the process of obtaining information more accessible to ordinary citizens. The 2005 Act is a more comprehensive and effective piece of legislation.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's ruling in *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* played a crucial role in establishing the right to information as an integral part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 of the Constitution.  This landmark decision provided the legal and constitutional basis for the subsequent enactment of the RTI Act, 2005. The case significantly contributed to the legal foundation for transparency and accountability in governance.


**8. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA grants Indian citizenship to illegal migrants who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians and who have entered India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, or Pakistan before a specified cut-off date, but excludes those from specific tribal areas in Northeast India.
2.  The CAA reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants from 11 years to 5 years, aligning it with the naturalization periods for other categories of migrants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAA, 2019, provides a pathway to Indian citizenship for illegal migrants belonging to six religious minorities (Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians) who have entered India from Pakistan, Bangladesh, or Afghanistan before December 31, 2014.  However, it explicitly excludes those residing in certain tribal areas of Northeast India, which are protected under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution or areas under Inner Line Permits.  The geographical exclusions are a key element of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAA reduces the naturalization period for the specified categories of migrants from 11 years to 5 years.  However, this is a *reduction* specific to these religious minority groups and does *not* align it with the naturalization periods applicable to other categories of migrants, who typically face a longer naturalization process.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the change in naturalization periods.


**9. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment only in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial or for offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2. The President's power to grant pardons extends to cases where the sentence is death, regardless of whether the conviction is from a civil court or a military court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 of the Constitution grants the President the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment in a broader range of cases than just those involving court-martials or offenses under Union laws.  The President's power extends to cases where the sentence is imposed by any court, including civil courts, for offenses against any law.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the President's pardon power.

Statement 2 is correct.  A crucial aspect of the President's pardon power under Article 72 is the ability to grant pardons, including commutations of death sentences. This power applies regardless of whether the conviction originates from a civil court or a military court.  The President's authority in death penalty cases is a significant constitutional prerogative.


**10. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are funded entirely by the states, with no central government contribution, to ensure efficient disposal of rape cases and those under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  A significant number of FTSCs, including those dedicated exclusively to POCSO cases (ePOCSO Courts), are operational across multiple states and union territories, linked to the National Judicial Data Grid for enhanced data management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the funding, primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund. While states may contribute, the scheme is not solely state-funded. The statement misrepresents the funding mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct.  A substantial number of FTSCs, including those specifically designated as ePOCSO Courts, are actively functioning across various states and union territories. The linkage to the National Judicial Data Grid is a crucial element, enabling improved data collection, analysis, and monitoring of case progress. The statement accurately reflects the operational reality of the FTSC network.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) and is implemented at all three tiers of Panchayats.
2.  A key component of the Abhiyan involves structured Ward Sabhas/Mahila Sabhas/Gram Sabhas, focusing on identifying thematic developmental gaps based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) and utilizing a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach' for localizing SDGs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign). Statement 1 correctly identifies the Abhiyan's aim and its multi-tiered implementation.  The initiative was indeed launched in 2018 under the name 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas' by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj. Statement 2 accurately describes a crucial component: the structured meetings at various levels (Gram Sabha, etc.) to identify developmental gaps using the PDI.  The thematic approach, based on localized SDGs and a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach', is a core feature of the Abhiyan's methodology.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to recognize the accuracy of both statements in describing the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.


**2. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1.  iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first centre of its kind in India and aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies, enhancing the independence of local government auditors.
2.  iCAL primarily functions as a knowledge centre and think tank, focusing solely on research and policy recommendations, leaving the practical aspects of local body audits to existing mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes iCAL's establishment, its aim to set global standards for auditing local governance, and its role in enhancing the independence of auditors.  It correctly positions iCAL as a center of excellence for capacity building. Statement 2 is incorrect because while iCAL does function as a knowledge center and think tank, it is not solely focused on research and policy.  It also plays a crucial role in capacity building for auditors, directly impacting the practical aspects of local body audits.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect, as they misrepresent iCAL's multifaceted role.


**3. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the audit of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) primarily through the AuditOnline application.
2.  The Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states conduct audits of funds granted by the state government to local bodies, operating independently of the CAG’s oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 incorrectly states that the CAG's oversight is *primarily* through the AuditOnline application. While AuditOnline is a significant tool, the CAG's mandate extends beyond this single application; it includes broader control and supervision mechanisms. Statement 2 is incorrect because the ELFA/DLFA, while conducting audits of state-granted funds, do *not* operate independently of the CAG's oversight. They function under the CAG's technical guidance and supervision.  Therefore, neither statement provides a fully accurate picture of the auditing mechanism for local bodies in India.


**4. Consider the following statements about the devolution of resources between the Union and States in India:**

1.  Vertical devolution refers to the share of divisible pool of taxes allocated to states, determined solely by the population size as per the latest Finance Commission recommendations.
2.  Horizontal devolution involves distributing the states’ share of the divisible pool based on various criteria, including income distance, area, population, demographic performance, and forest cover, with equal weightage given to each factor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because vertical devolution is not determined *solely* by population size.  While population is a factor, other criteria, as determined by the Finance Commission, also play a role.  Statement 2 is also incorrect because the weightage given to various criteria in horizontal devolution is *not* equal.  The 15th Finance Commission, for example, assigned different weights to factors such as income distance, area, and population.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the complexities of resource devolution in India.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The grant of Special Category Status (SCS) is based on a state's geographical location, with coastal states automatically qualifying for this status regardless of their socio-economic indicators.
2.  SCS was initially introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission and has remained unchanged since then, with the same states continuously holding this status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are inaccurate.  Statement 1 incorrectly suggests that geographical location alone determines SCS.  The grant of SCS is a complex process considering both geographical and socio-economic disadvantages. Coastal location is not an automatic qualifier. Statement 2 is also wrong because the list of states with SCS has evolved since 1969, and the criteria for granting this status have been subject to review and modification over time. The initial states granted SCS in 1969 were not the same states that held it continuously thereafter.  Therefore, neither statement provides a correct representation of the SCS mechanism.


**6. With reference to Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPATs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  EVMs are manufactured exclusively by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure impartiality and transparency in the electoral process.
2.  VVPATs were initially introduced in a pilot project in one state before their nationwide deployment in 2019, primarily to address concerns about the accuracy and trustworthiness of the EVM system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. EVMs are not manufactured exclusively by the ECI. They are manufactured and supplied to the ECI by public sector undertakings like Bharat Electronics Limited and Electronics Corporation of India Limited. Statement 2 is correct. VVPATs were indeed initially piloted in one state (Goa) before their full deployment during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.  This phased rollout aimed to address concerns about EVM accuracy and enhance voter confidence. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections in India:**

1.  The MCC is a legally binding document enforced by the Election Commission of India (ECI), with violations resulting in immediate disqualification of candidates.
2.  The MCC was first introduced in 1960 during the Kerala state assembly elections, and its provisions have remained largely unchanged since then.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because the MCC is not a legally binding document in the sense that violations don't automatically lead to immediate disqualification. While the ECI can take action against violations, the process involves investigation and potential penalties, but not automatic disqualification.  Statement 2 is incorrect because while the MCC originated in 1960 during the Kerala elections, its provisions have been updated and refined over time to adapt to evolving political landscapes and technological advancements.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the nature and evolution of the MCC.


**8. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi primarily focuses on traditional classroom-based training programs for government officials to enhance their administrative skills.
2.  The Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT)-Karmayogi platform is a key component of Mission Karmayogi, providing a comprehensive online portal for capacity building but does not include performance monitoring of its users.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents Mission Karmayogi's approach.  It emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training, utilizing a competency-driven approach and incorporating on-the-job learning.  Classroom-based training is not its primary focus.  Statement 2 is also inaccurate because the iGOT-Karmayogi platform *does* include performance monitoring of its users, evaluating key performance indicators for learners, supervisors, and content providers.  Therefore, neither statement correctly describes Mission Karmayogi's core principles or the functionalities of the iGOT-Karmayogi platform.


**9.  Consider the following statements about the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India:**

1. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, are the only designated nodal agencies in the Union Government responsible for handling public grievances.
2.  The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI) is used to rank Ministries/Departments based on their grievance redressal performance, but it does not provide insights into areas of improvement for individual organizations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances are significant nodal agencies, they are not the *only* ones.  Other agencies and mechanisms also play a role in grievance redressal at various levels of government. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The GRAI is designed not only to rank Ministries/Departments but also to provide valuable insights into their strengths and areas for improvement, offering a comparative picture for organizational learning and improvement.  Thus, neither statement accurately describes the comprehensive nature of the GRM in India or the functionalities of the GRAI.


**10. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are exclusively under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, with no involvement from state governments in their functioning.
2.  Recent policy changes have resulted in the merger of land portions from several cantonment boards with the concerned state local bodies, indicating a shift towards greater local governance involvement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are significantly linked to the Ministry of Defence, they are not exclusively under its control.  State governments also have some level of involvement in their administration and functioning.  Statement 2 is correct; recent policy decisions have indeed led to the merger of certain land portions from Cantonment Boards with respective state local bodies, signaling a move towards increased integration with local governance structures.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they misrepresent the administrative structure of Cantonment Boards or the recent policy changes.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010, as amended:**

1.  The amended FCRA mandates that all NGOs receiving foreign funds must have a designated FCRA account in a specific branch of State Bank of India in New Delhi, irrespective of their location in India.
2.  Under the amended FCRA, NGOs can utilize up to 50% of the foreign contribution received for administrative expenses, reflecting a relaxation of previous restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The amended FCRA does indeed mandate that NGOs receiving foreign funds must have a designated FCRA account in a specified branch of SBI in New Delhi.  This is a central requirement for receiving and managing foreign contributions. Statement 2 is incorrect. The amended FCRA actually *reduced* the permissible usage of foreign contribution for administrative expenses to a maximum of 20%, unlike the earlier limit of 50%.  This reflects a tightening, not a relaxation, of regulations.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect.


**12. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Post Office Act, 2023, repealed the Indian Post Office Act, 1898, and introduced a new regulatory framework for postal services in India.
2.  The Act empowers the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) to make regulations on various aspects of postal services, including charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps, but does not establish a regulatory body separate from the DGPS.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Post Office Act, 2023, repealed the Indian Post Office Act, 1998 (not 1898), and introduced a revised framework.  The year is crucial and its misrepresentation makes the statement factually incorrect. Statement 2 is largely correct. The Act does empower the DGPS to make regulations on various aspects of postal services, including those mentioned.  While there might be other bodies involved in postal service regulation, the statement doesn't explicitly claim the DGPS is the *only* regulatory body.  Thus, option (b) is the most appropriate answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in the year mentioned in statement 1.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding Aadhaar in India:**

1.  Aadhaar is primarily a proof of citizenship, providing irrefutable evidence of an individual's nationality and domicile within India.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act upheld the Act's constitutionality but mandated that Aadhaar be mandatory for accessing all government services and private sector transactions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is wrong because Aadhaar is primarily a proof of address and identity for residents of India, not a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship is determined through other legal processes.  Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment, while upholding the Aadhaar Act's constitutionality, did *not* mandate Aadhaar for all government services and private sector transactions. It specified that Aadhaar would be mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes but not for opening bank accounts or mobile connections.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the nature and legal status of Aadhaar in India.


**14. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes fully funded by the central government, implemented by state governments, and focused on sectors listed exclusively in the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report, which recommended streamlining the scheme approval process and enhancing the role of state governments in scheme implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the central government.  They also cover sectors in both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, not exclusively the Union List. Statement 2 is largely correct. The current framework for CSSs is indeed based on a 2015 report (by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs) that recommended streamlining the approval process and increasing state government involvement. Therefore, option (b) is the most accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the funding mechanism and the constitutional basis of CSSs.


**15. Consider the following statements about the Telecommunications Act, 2023:**

1. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, retains the existing framework for spectrum allocation, continuing with the previous system of administrative allocation based on need.
2.  The Act introduces a comprehensive regulatory framework for Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms, bringing them under the purview of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because the Telecommunications Act, 2023, *shifts* towards auction-based spectrum allocation for most purposes, unlike the previous system which relied more heavily on administrative allocation.  While administrative allocation continues for specific purposes like national security, the shift is significant. Statement 2 is also incorrect because the Act does *not* bring OTT platforms under a comprehensive regulatory framework within the Act itself.  The regulation of OTT platforms is left outside the scope of this particular Act. Therefore, neither statement correctly reflects the key provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 2023.


**16. With reference to Mediation Service Providers in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mediation Service Providers must be recognized by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) to conduct mediation proceedings, ensuring a standardized and regulated approach.
2.  Agreements reached through mediation are legally binding and enforceable, but cannot be challenged in any court of law under any circumstances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because Mediation Service Providers are recognized by the Mediation Council of India (MCI), not the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA).  This is a crucial distinction. Statement 2 is also incorrect because agreements reached through mediation, while legally binding and enforceable, are *not* unchallengeable in court. They can be challenged on specific grounds, such as fraud, corruption, or impersonation, within a limited timeframe (90 days).  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements.


**17. Consider the following statements regarding Lok Adalats in India:**

1. Lok Adalats are established under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987, and operate independently of the formal court system, with their decisions being non-binding and subject to appeal in regular courts.
2.  Lok Adalats can handle a wide range of cases, including those pending in regular courts, and those which are yet to be filed, but they cannot address cases involving criminal offenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because Lok Adalat decisions are *binding* and not subject to appeal in regular courts. Their decisions have the same force as a regular court decree. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Lok Adalats can handle a wide range of civil and commercial disputes, including those pending in courts or pre-litigation matters, their jurisdiction does not extend to criminal offenses.  They deal primarily with civil and commercial matters.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes the nature and scope of Lok Adalats.


**18. With reference to free legal aid in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The provision of free legal aid is a fundamental right guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, ensuring equal access to justice for all citizens regardless of their socio-economic status.
2. Legal Services Authorities (LSAs) play a crucial role in providing free legal aid to marginalized sections of society, including prison inmates, but their services are limited to civil cases and do not extend to criminal matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are partially correct but not entirely accurate. Statement 1 is partially correct because while access to justice is linked to Article 21, it is not explicitly stated as a fundamental right in the same way other rights are. The right to legal aid is a derivative right emanating from Article 21.  Statement 2 is partially correct as LSAs do provide free legal aid, including to prison inmates, but their services are *not* limited to civil cases; they also extend to some criminal matters, particularly those involving underprivileged individuals.  Therefore, neither statement provides a completely accurate and comprehensive description of free legal aid in India.  The nuances and complexities of the legal aid system require a more precise understanding than presented in these statements.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute the sentence of any person convicted by a court-martial, for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a death sentence, but excludes offenses tried by state courts.
2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is final and binding, and there is no further legal recourse available to the condemned person.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense, irrespective of whether it was tried by a court-martial or a state court, as long as it falls under the purview of the Union's executive power.  The statement incorrectly limits the President's power by excluding state court convictions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President's decision holds significant weight, it is not entirely without legal challenge.  The Supreme Court has the power of judicial review, and in exceptional circumstances, could potentially intervene if procedural irregularities or fundamental rights violations are demonstrated in the process leading to the President's decision.  The Supreme Court's curative petition mechanism also offers a final avenue for redressal in extremely rare circumstances. Therefore, the President's decision is not absolutely final and binding.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it addresses issues of alleged judicial error that were not raised in the original appeal or review petition.
2.  The grounds for filing a curative petition include violations of principles of natural justice, a judge's failure to disclose a connection with the case, and a demonstrable apprehension of bias that significantly prejudiced the petitioner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court has dismissed their review petition. It is designed to address exceptional circumstances where fundamental errors of justice have occurred that were not previously identified or addressed.  The emphasis is on addressing serious flaws in the judicial process rather than merely re-arguing the merits of the case.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The grounds for filing a curative petition are extremely limited and focus on serious procedural improprieties or fundamental breaches of justice.  Violations of natural justice (fair hearing), undisclosed conflicts of interest by judges, and demonstrable bias that significantly impacted the outcome of the case are all accepted grounds.  The bar for success in a curative petition is extremely high.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established primarily to address the backlog of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, with a secondary focus on rape cases. Funding is provided entirely by state governments.
2.  The implementation of FTSCs is overseen by the Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice, and their objective is to ensure the swift disposal of cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs significantly contribute to addressing the backlog of POCSO Act cases, they are equally focused on resolving rape cases.  The statement also wrongly attributes funding solely to state governments. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Justice, under the Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for the implementation of the FTSC scheme. The core objective is to expedite the justice process for victims of rape and sexual offenses under the POCSO Act, thereby reducing the time taken for trial and judgment.


**4. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI is empowered to monitor compliance with data protection regulations, impose penalties for violations, and direct data fiduciaries to address data breaches, but it cannot hear grievances directly from affected individuals.
2.  Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are made to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT). Board members serve a single, non-renewable term of two years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPBI's powers include monitoring compliance, imposing penalties, and directing action for data breaches. Crucially, it also has the explicit function of hearing grievances directly from affected persons, a key aspect of its role in ensuring data protection rights.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While appeals against DPBI decisions are indeed possible, they are not necessarily made to the TDSAT. The specific appellate body would depend on the nature of the decision and the relevant legal framework.  Additionally, DPBI board members are appointed for two years and are eligible for reappointment, contradicting the statement's assertion of a single, non-renewable term.


**5. With reference to the rights and duties of data principals under data protection law, consider the following statements:**

1. Data principals have the right to obtain information about the processing of their personal data, seek correction or erasure of inaccurate or incomplete data, and initiate grievance redressal procedures.  However, they do not have the right to nominate a representative to exercise these rights in case of incapacity or death.
2. Data principals have a duty to ensure the accuracy and completeness of their own personal data submitted to data fiduciaries, and failure to do so can result in penalties of up to Rs. 10,000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Data principals do indeed possess the rights listed: access to information about data processing, correction or erasure, and grievance redressal.  Significantly, they also have the right to nominate a representative to exercise their rights in cases of incapacity or death, ensuring continued protection of their data even in such circumstances.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While data principals have a responsibility to provide accurate information, the penalty of up to Rs. 10,000 for violating this duty applies to the filing of false or frivolous complaints or providing false particulars—not necessarily for inaccuracies in their personal data itself.  The penalty for providing inaccurate data would likely fall under different provisions and regulations.


**6. With reference to the obligations of data fiduciaries, consider the following statements:**

1. Data fiduciaries are required to maintain the accuracy and completeness of personal data, implement reasonable security safeguards against data breaches, and erase personal data once the purpose for which it was collected is fulfilled, unless legally required to retain it. They are not obligated to inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a data breach.
2.  Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) are designated by the state government based on factors such as the volume and sensitivity of data processed and the potential risk to the rights of data principals.  They are required to appoint a data protection officer but not an independent data auditor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Data fiduciaries are indeed responsible for data accuracy, security safeguards, and timely erasure. Importantly, they *are* obligated to inform both the DPBI and affected individuals in the event of a data breach—a crucial aspect of transparency and accountability in data protection.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. SDF designation is done by the *central*, not state, government.  Furthermore, SDFs are required to appoint both a data protection officer *and* an independent data auditor, reflecting the heightened level of scrutiny and accountability associated with handling large volumes of sensitive personal data.


**7. With reference to exemptions under data protection law, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exemptions from the rights of data principals and obligations of data fiduciaries (except data security) apply to cases involving the enforcement of legal rights and claims, the prevention and investigation of offenses, and the performance of judicial or regulatory functions, but not for research, archiving, or statistical purposes.
2. The central government has the authority to grant exemptions to certain activities in the interest of national security and public order, but not for the processing of personal data of non-residents under foreign contracts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While exemptions do cover legal enforcement, crime prevention, and judicial/regulatory functions, they also extend to research, archiving, and statistical purposes – activities that often require processing personal data but may be subject to specific safeguards and limitations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The central government can indeed grant exemptions for national security and public order.  Importantly, exemptions also extend to the processing of personal data of non-residents under foreign contracts, acknowledging the complexities of cross-border data flows and international legal frameworks.


**8. With reference to the processing of personal data of children, consider the following statements:**

1. Data fiduciaries are prohibited from processing a child's personal data if it is likely to cause a detrimental effect on the child's well-being, but they are permitted to engage in tracking, behavioral monitoring, or targeted advertising of children.
2.  The penalties for non-fulfillment of obligations related to children's data are significantly higher than those for general data protection violations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Data fiduciaries are explicitly prohibited from processing a child's data if it's likely to harm their well-being.  Furthermore, tracking, behavioral monitoring, and targeted advertising of children are specifically prohibited, underscoring the heightened protection afforded to children's data.

Statement 2 is correct.  The penalties for violations concerning children's data are substantially higher than those for general data protection violations, reflecting the increased vulnerability and need for heightened protection of children's personal information.  This reflects the greater emphasis placed on safeguarding children's rights in the data protection framework.


**9. With reference to cross-border data transfers, consider the following statements:**

1.  The transfer of personal data outside India is generally permitted, but the government can restrict transfers to specific countries based on their data protection standards and legal frameworks.
2.  There are no specific provisions within the data protection law that address the right to be forgotten.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The law allows for cross-border data transfers but empowers the government to restrict transfers to countries that do not meet certain data protection standards or have inadequate legal frameworks to protect personal data. This helps safeguard the rights of data principals even when data is transferred internationally.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The current data protection legislation does not explicitly include a "right to be forgotten," a concept found in some other jurisdictions' data protection laws.  The inclusion or exclusion of such a right is a matter of ongoing debate and policy considerations.


**10. With reference to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The rules mandate that venue-in-charges must file a First Information Report (FIR) if a prima facie case of unfair means or an offense is detected during a public examination, regardless of the severity of the infraction.
2.  If the management or board of directors of a service provider is implicated in unfair means, a committee is to be constituted by the public examination authority to investigate the matter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the rules empower venue-in-charges to take appropriate action, including filing an FIR, it is not mandatory to file an FIR for every instance of suspected unfair means. The decision to file an FIR would depend on the gravity of the offense and the evidence available.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules explicitly state that if the management or board of directors of a service provider is involved in unfair means during a public examination, the public examination authority must constitute a committee to investigate the matter thoroughly.  This highlights the seriousness with which such involvement is viewed.


**11. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act repeals the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and the Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, but continues to regulate Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms under its provisions.
2. Spectrum allocation is primarily done through auctions, except for specified uses where administrative allocation is permitted, such as for national security and disaster management.  The Right of Way (RoW) framework is based on a discriminatory and exclusive basis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Telecommunications Act, 2023, does indeed repeal the older acts. However, a key point is that it *does not* regulate OTT platforms under its provisions; it leaves their regulation to other relevant laws and regulations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Spectrum allocation is primarily through auctions, with exceptions for specified uses (national security, disaster management, etc.)  Crucially, the RoW framework is designed to be *non-discriminatory and non-exclusive*, facilitating infrastructure development and ensuring fair access.


**12. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the amended FCRA, NGOs are required to obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds and submit Aadhaar details of every office-bearer, but they are not required to maintain a designated FCRA account.
2.  The validity of FCRA registration is five years, with renewal applications due within six months of expiry.  NGOs can utilize up to 50% of foreign funds for administrative expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amended FCRA mandates prior permission and Aadhaar details for office-bearers.  Importantly, it also requires NGOs to maintain a designated FCRA account in specified SBI branches to receive and manage foreign funds.

Statement 2 is partially correct regarding the five-year validity and renewal timeline. However, it is incorrect about the permissible usage of foreign funds for administrative expenses. The limit is now 20%, not 50%, reflecting a stricter approach to the allocation of foreign funds.


**13. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act appoints the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) as the head of India Post, granting the DGPS the power to make regulations concerning service charges but not the supply and sale of postage stamps.
2. The Post Office Act, 2023, repeals the India Post Office Act, 1998.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 Act does appoint the DGPS as head and grants regulatory powers.  However, the DGPS's powers extend to making regulations on both service charges *and* the supply and sale of postage stamps, reflecting comprehensive control over postal services.

Statement 2 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, explicitly repeals the 1998 Act, reflecting a significant update to the legal framework governing postal services in India.


**14. With reference to the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), consider the following statements:**

1. The RTBF, originating from French jurisprudence, is an absolute right, and the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates it.
2. The Supreme Court of India, in the Puttaswamy case (2017), recognized the RTBF as a facet of the right to life under Article 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTBF, while rooted in French jurisprudence, is *not* an absolute right; it is subject to limitations and balancing with other interests.  Furthermore, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* explicitly mention the right to be forgotten.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court, in the Puttaswamy case, did recognize the RTBF as an aspect of the right to life and personal dignity under Article 21, although it did not define its precise scope or limitations.


**15. With reference to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, consider the following statements:**

1. The ILP system is primarily intended to regulate the movement of foreign nationals near India's international borders and is not applicable to Indian citizens.
2.  The ILP system is currently in effect in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Manipur.  NRIs, PIO cardholders, and OCI cardholders are eligible for ILPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ILP system is used to regulate the movement of *Indian citizens* into designated protected areas, primarily in northeastern states.  It aims to protect tribal cultures and regulate access to sensitive border regions, not to control foreign national movement.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the ILP system is indeed in effect in the four states mentioned, NRIs, PIO cardholders, and OCI cardholders are *not* eligible for ILPs. They require different permits, like Protected/Restricted Area Permits, to access these areas.


**16. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People’s Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs), focusing solely on Gram Panchayats, excluding Block and District Panchayats.  It employs a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) but does not utilize the Panchayat Development Index (PDI).
2.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018 as ‘Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas’ by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj and involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, and community-based organizations, including Self Help Groups (SHGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims to involve people at all three levels of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District) in PDP preparation.  It uses a thematic approach based on localized SDGs *and* utilizes the PDI to identify developmental gaps.

Statement 2 is correct. The campaign was launched as stated, involving the specified stakeholders to ensure inclusive and participatory planning at the grassroots level.


**17. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such centre in India and aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  It will primarily focus on auditing the financial aspects of local bodies, neglecting performance audits.
2.  The iCAL will work independently of existing auditing mechanisms for local bodies, such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the iCAL is the first such center in India and aims to set global standards, its scope is not limited to financial audits.  It will likely encompass performance audits and other aspects of good governance in local bodies.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The iCAL is unlikely to operate completely independently of existing mechanisms.  It will likely complement and collaborate with existing audit bodies, such as the CAG, to enhance the overall effectiveness of local governance auditing.


**18. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are primarily focused on schemes that are not part of the National Development Agenda and are implemented solely by the central government without any state government involvement. Funding is solely provided by the Consolidated Fund of India.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on a 2015 report, and they constitute approximately 10.4% of the Centre's budget expenditure.  The funding pattern for core schemes varies depending on the state's location and legislative status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are indeed based on the 2015 report and constitute approximately 10.4% of central budget expenditure. However, they are *specifically* focused on schemes within the National Development Agenda, requiring collaborative efforts between the Centre and states.  Funding for CSSs is routed through the Consolidated Fund of *States*, not solely the Consolidated Fund of India.

Statement 2 is correct. The framework is based on the 2015 report, and the percentage of budget allocation is accurate. The funding pattern for core schemes does vary depending on the state's location (North Eastern/Himalayan states receive a higher central share) and whether it is a state with a legislature or a Union Territory.


**19. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi is a capacity-building initiative for all civil servants (excluding contractual employees) across various Union Government ministries and departments.  It focuses on rule-based training and capacity building, emphasizing hierarchical structures.
2.  The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), launched in 2021, is a component of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi.  The primary guiding principle is a shift from a competency-driven approach to a role-based approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi includes *all* civil servants, including contractual employees.  Critically, it emphasizes a *shift from rule-based to role-based* training and capacity building, moving away from rigid hierarchical structures.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The CBC is indeed part of NPCSCB-Mission Karmayogi. However, the primary guiding principle is a *shift from rule-based to role-based* and a move towards a *competency-driven* approach, not the reverse as stated.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards were initially established by the British East India Company after the Battle of Plassey in 1757, with Barrackpore being the first one.
2. The administration of Cantonment Boards falls under the purview of the state governments, as per the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonments, areas housing military troops, were established by the East India Company following the Battle of Plassey. Barrackpore near Calcutta was the first cantonment, established in 1765.  This reflects the historical context of cantonment development in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act deals with local self-governance, the administration of Cantonment Boards falls under the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List), not the state governments.  They are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.  This highlights the unique constitutional position of Cantonment Boards within India's federal structure.  The statement incorrectly attributes administrative control to the state level.


**2. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to a healthy environment to Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution, specifically mentioning the Great Indian Bustard's protection.
2. The Supreme Court's judgment in the Great Indian Bustard case significantly restricts the executive powers of the government in matters related to environmental protection.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court did indeed link the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change and environmental degradation to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution. This landmark judgment, arising from a case concerning the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, broadened the interpretation of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.  This exemplifies the judiciary's role in expanding the scope of constitutional protection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the judgment emphasized the importance of environmental protection and potentially limits certain actions detrimental to the environment, it doesn't significantly restrict *all* executive powers related to environmental protection. The court's role is primarily interpretive and judicial, not directly executive.  The ruling sets a precedent and guides future executive actions, but doesn't unilaterally curtail all executive authority in this domain.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in the Northeastern states of India.
2. The ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess limited legislative and executive powers, primarily focusing on local governance matters.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), specifically applies to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. It provides a framework for the establishment of ADCs and ARCs within these states' tribal areas.  This reflects the specific constitutional provisions tailored to the unique socio-political context of the Northeast.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule have significant powers, including executive, legislative, and even judicial powers in specified areas.  These powers extend to matters like forest management, agriculture, and customary law. This contrasts with a limited role; they have substantial autonomy within their designated jurisdictions. The statement underestimates the extent of their authority.


**4. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to form new states or alter the boundaries of existing states rests solely with the Parliament, requiring a simple majority vote.
2.  The President of India must recommend the introduction of any bill related to the formation of new states or alteration of existing ones.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Parliament has the power to form new states (Article 3), it does not require a simple majority. The process mandates a specific procedure, including the President's recommendation before the bill is introduced.  This highlights the constitutional checks and balances in the process.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly states that a bill for the formation of new states or alteration of boundaries can only be introduced in Parliament *on the recommendation of the President*. This signifies the President's crucial role in ensuring adherence to constitutional norms during such significant territorial changes.  The President's recommendation is a non-negotiable prerequisite.


**5. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a statutory instrument, legally binding on all political parties, candidates, and government officials during election periods.
2. Violations of the MCC can result in direct criminal prosecution under the Indian Penal Code.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The MCC is not a statutory instrument; it's a set of guidelines issued by the Election Commission of India (ECI). While it's expected to be followed by all stakeholders, it lacks the force of law. This distinguishes it from legally binding statutes.  The MCC's reliance on voluntary compliance is a key aspect of its nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Since the MCC isn't a statute, violations aren't directly prosecuted under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).  However, certain provisions of the MCC can be enforced through related provisions in other laws like the Representation of the People Act, 1951.  The statement incorrectly suggests direct prosecution under the IPC.  The consequences for violating the MCC are indirect and depend on other legal frameworks.


**6. With reference to Lok Sabha elections in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lok Sabha elections employ a proportional representation system, ensuring representation proportional to the votes received by each party.
2.  Each Lok Sabha constituency elects a single representative, making it a single-member constituency system.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lok Sabha elections utilize the First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) system, not proportional representation. In FPTP, the candidate with the most votes in a constituency wins, regardless of whether they secure an absolute majority.  This can lead to disproportionate representation compared to the overall vote share of parties.

Statement 2 is correct.  Each Lok Sabha constituency elects only one representative; this is the defining characteristic of a single-member constituency system.  This contrasts with systems where multiple representatives are elected from a single constituency. The simplicity of the single-member system is a key feature of Indian elections.


**7. With reference to Special Category States (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states, outlining specific socio-economic indicators.
2. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS classification, replacing it with a new funding mechanism.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution doesn't explicitly define criteria for granting Special Category Status.  The criteria have evolved over time based on factors like geographical disadvantages and socio-economic conditions, often influenced by Finance Commission recommendations. This lack of explicit constitutional definition is a key feature of the SCS classification.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended discontinuing the SCS classification.  While special funding continues for some states, it's no longer based on the SCS designation but on other criteria, shifting the approach to state funding. This reflects a change in the approach to fiscal federalism in India.


**8. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  All of Arunachal Pradesh and parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are designated as Protected Areas.
2.  Foreigners require special permits to enter Restricted Areas, including the Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim, regardless of their nationality.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text accurately states that the entire state of Arunachal Pradesh and parts of several other states are designated as Protected Areas. This reflects the geographical distribution of these areas within India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While special permits are required for foreigners to enter Restricted Areas (like Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim), the exception is citizens of Bhutan.  The statement incorrectly implies that *all* foreigners need permits irrespective of their nationality.  This highlights a crucial detail often overlooked regarding access regulations.


**9. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seventh Schedule of the Constitution outlines the division of tax powers between the Union and State governments, and the distribution of revenues is solely based on this division.
2.  Grants-in-aid provided by the Union government to States are contingent upon the states meeting specific performance targets set by the Union government.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Seventh Schedule defines the tax powers, the distribution of revenues isn't solely based on this.  The Finance Commission plays a crucial role in recommending the vertical and horizontal distribution of resources, considering various factors beyond the simple tax division. This highlights the dynamic nature of fiscal federalism in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Grants-in-aid are provided under Article 275 of the Constitution. While these grants can be tied to specific purposes, they are not necessarily contingent on states meeting performance targets set by the Union government. The conditionality of grants is not a universal principle but rather depends on the specific agreement between the Union and State.


**10. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is the first institution of its kind in India dedicated to setting global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2. iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of local governance bodies across India, replacing existing audit mechanisms.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance, making it a unique initiative within India.  This reflects an effort to improve the quality and consistency of local government audits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL doesn't replace existing audit mechanisms. Instead, it aims to enhance capacity building for auditors and serve as a center of excellence, working alongside existing structures.  The statement incorrectly presents iCAL as a direct replacement, overlooking its collaborative role.  iCAL's function is to improve the existing system, not to completely supplant it.


**11. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan is a centrally-sponsored scheme implemented solely by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj.
2. The primary objective of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) through participatory planning processes at all three tiers of Panchayats.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Panchayati Raj plays a significant role, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves participation from elected representatives, government officials, and community-based organizations at various levels. It's not solely a centrally-sponsored scheme implemented only by the Ministry. This highlights the collaborative nature of the program's implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The core aim of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is to prepare PDPs through participatory planning, involving various stakeholders at the Gram Panchayat, Block Panchayat, and District Panchayat levels. This participatory approach is central to the campaign's philosophy.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding Passports in India:**

1. The issuance of passports in India is the sole responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs.
2.  Only citizens of India are eligible to apply for Indian passports.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of External Affairs plays a central role, the Passport Issuance process involves multiple agencies and departments at various levels.  The statement oversimplifies the complex administrative structure involved in passport issuance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text itself states that the Central Government *may* issue a passport to a person who is not a citizen of India if it's deemed necessary in the public interest.  This exception demonstrates that citizenship isn't an absolute requirement for passport issuance in all cases.  The statement fails to account for this exception.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is in accordance with the 73rd Constitutional Amendment Act.
2.  The Station Commander of a Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board and is appointed by the Ministry of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, which is in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act (not the 73rd), dealing with urban local bodies.  The 73rd Amendment deals with Panchayats.  The Cantonments Act provides the legal framework for their administration, outlining their powers and functions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a Cantonment serves as the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board. This position is inherently linked to the military's presence and administrative control within the cantonment area.  While the Board itself has some degree of autonomy in civic matters, the ultimate administrative control rests with the Ministry of Defence.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's stance on environmental issues and fundamental rights, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court has held that the right to a pollution-free environment is implicitly guaranteed under Article 19 of the Constitution, ensuring the right to freedom of movement and occupation.
2.  A recent Supreme Court judgment linked the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life) of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has extensively recognized the right to a healthy environment,  it has primarily linked this right to Article 21 (right to life) and not explicitly to Article 19 (right to freedom).  Article 19 deals with freedoms like speech, assembly, etc., and while environmental degradation can indirectly impact these freedoms, the direct link to Article 19 is not established as prominently as the link to Article 21.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court, in a recent judgment, explicitly linked the right to be free from the adverse impacts of climate change to Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life). This signifies a broadening of the interpretation of these fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.  The judgment highlighted that the unequal impact of climate change affects the right to equality, and the threat to life posed by climate change directly impacts the right to life.


**3. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, all areas falling between the Inner Line and the International Border of a state are declared Protected Areas, requiring permits for foreign nationals to enter.
2.  The entire Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands is designated as a Restricted Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, while parts of Sikkim are classified as both Protected and Restricted Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, clearly defines the areas between the Inner Line and the international border as Protected Areas.  This regulation aims to control the entry of foreigners into sensitive border regions.  Foreign nationals generally require permits to enter these areas, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, specifically designates the entire Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands as a Restricted Area.  Parts of Sikkim are categorized under both Protected and Restricted Areas, reflecting the varying levels of access control in different regions within the state based on security and environmental considerations.


**4.  With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 269 of the Constitution outlines the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the states but assigned to the Union government.
2.  The Goods and Services Tax (GST) levied and collected in the course of inter-state trade or commerce is distributed between the Centre and States based on the recommendations of the GST Council, as per Article 269-A.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Article 269 deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States, not the other way around.  The Union government collects certain taxes but allocates the revenue to the states.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 269-A specifically addresses the distribution of GST revenue collected from inter-state trade and commerce. The GST Council, a body comprising representatives from the Centre and States, makes recommendations on how this revenue is shared.  This mechanism is a crucial aspect of India's fiscal federalism, ensuring a degree of balance and cooperation between different levels of government.


**5. With reference to the Indian Passport system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports is solely under the purview of the state governments, with the central government having no direct role.
2.  Besides ordinary passports (blue), India issues diplomatic passports (white) and official passports (maroon).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While state governments may assist in the process, the issuance of passports is primarily a function of the central government, specifically the Ministry of External Affairs.  State governments play a supporting role in processing applications and verifying information, but the final authority rests with the central government.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's passport system offers three categories: ordinary passports (blue), diplomatic passports (white), and official passports (maroon).  The type of passport issued depends on the holder's status—ordinary for citizens, diplomatic for diplomats, and official for government officials on official business.


**6. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are a part of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP), and their primary goal is to provide digital literacy training to rural citizens.
2.  CSCs offer a range of services, including G2C (government-to-citizen) services like Aadhaar services and ITR filing, as well as B2C (business-to-consumer) services and financial services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSCs are indeed part of the NeGP, their primary aim is not solely focused on digital literacy training.  Although digital literacy is a component, their broader goal is to provide a diverse range of government, private, and social sector services to rural citizens, leveraging technology for greater accessibility.

Statement 2 is correct. CSCs act as a crucial bridge connecting rural citizens to a wide array of services.  This includes G2C services like Aadhaar-related services, income tax return filing, and other government-related transactions.  Additionally, they offer B2C services such as bill payments, mobile recharges, and financial services like banking, insurance, and pension-related assistance.


**7. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and they are applicable to all states and union territories in India without exception.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class, and they primarily handle civil disputes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, does have exceptions.  It exempts certain states (Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim) and specified tribal areas.  The Act's implementation is not uniform across the entire country.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are deemed to be courts of Judicial Magistrates of the First Class, their jurisdiction is not limited to civil disputes. They handle both civil and criminal cases, focusing on petty disputes at the village level.  Their primary aim is to provide swift and accessible justice at the grassroots level.


**8. With reference to the President's power regarding mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2.  The President's power to grant mercy extends to all sentences, including those imposed by state courts, but not those imposed by lower courts within the states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in a broader range of cases than just those imposed by court-martial. It also includes sentences given for offences against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power and, significantly, death sentences.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The President's mercy power extends to death sentences and sentences imposed for offences against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends. This includes sentences passed by state courts. However,  the statement incorrectly suggests a limitation on lower courts within states which is not the case.  The scope of Article 72 is not limited by court hierarchy within the state judicial system.


**9. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court and is considered the last resort for legal redress.
2.  The grounds for filing a curative petition include allegations of fraud or misconduct by a judge during the original trial, but not the violation of the principles of natural justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort available to a litigant after all other avenues, including a review petition, have been exhausted. It's a mechanism designed to address exceptional situations where there are serious flaws in the judicial process that require rectification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Violation of principles of natural justice is a valid ground for filing a curative petition.  While allegations of fraud or misconduct are also valid grounds, the statement mistakenly excludes the violation of natural justice, which is a fundamental aspect of fair judicial proceedings.


**10. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs are funded entirely by the state governments, with no financial contribution from the central government.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the speedy disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.  While state governments may also contribute, the funding is not solely from state resources.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of FTSCs is directly aimed at resolving cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases more efficiently.  The goal is to reduce the backlog of such cases and ensure quicker justice for victims.  The scheme's focus on swift disposal is a key aspect of its design and implementation.


**11. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2.  ADCs have the power to make laws on matters such as land revenue collection and mineral extraction royalties, but not on subjects like forest management or agriculture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule specifically empowers the Governor to create ADCs and ARCs in the four states mentioned: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  This provision is designed to address the unique needs and governance structures of tribal communities in these states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ADCs possess extensive powers, including the authority to make laws on subjects like forest management, agriculture, land revenue collection, and the collection of royalties from mineral extraction.  These powers are crucial for the self-governance of the tribal areas under their jurisdiction.


**12. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to form a new state rests solely with the President of India, who can do so by issuing an executive order.
2.  Any bill for the formation of a new state must be introduced in Parliament only on the recommendation of the President.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The formation of a new state is not solely the President's prerogative.  While the President plays a crucial role, the process is fundamentally parliamentary.  Parliament, through a law passed by both Houses, has the power to form new states.  The President's role is primarily to give assent to the bill passed by the Parliament.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 of the Constitution explicitly states that a bill for the formation of a new state or for altering the boundaries of existing states can only be introduced in Parliament with the President's recommendation.  This ensures that the executive branch is involved in this significant constitutional process.


**13. With reference to Special Category States (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended the continuation of the SCS status for certain states based on their unique developmental challenges.
2.  The Constitution of India explicitly includes provisions for categorizing states as SCS, outlining the specific criteria for such categorization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission actually recommended the discontinuation of the SCS status.  The rationale behind this was to create a more uniform system of central assistance, based on objective criteria, rather than relying on the special category status.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Constitution does not explicitly define or provide criteria for designating states as SCS.  The categorization historically emerged through government policies and decisions, guided by factors such as geographical limitations, economic backwardness, and strategic importance.  The lack of a constitutional basis made the system susceptible to political considerations.


**14. With reference to Inner Line Permits (ILPs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  ILPs are issued only to foreign nationals wishing to visit the states where they are applicable, and Indian citizens do not require ILPs to travel within these states.
2.  The ILP system aims to regulate the movement of people near India's international borders and to protect the distinct cultures of tribal communities in Northeast India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  ILPs are applicable to Indian citizens as well, not just to foreign nationals. While foreign nationals need permits to enter the restricted areas, even Indian citizens from outside these areas need ILPs to enter and stay within the permitted areas for a limited time.

Statement 2 is correct. The ILP system serves a dual purpose. It's a tool for regulating the movement of people in border areas for security reasons. It also acts as a mechanism to safeguard the unique cultural identity and practices of tribal communities in Northeast India by controlling the influx of outsiders.


**15. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Constitution of India, ensuring the protection of fundamental rights.
2.  The accreditation of the NHRC by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) is based on its performance in upholding human rights standards and its adherence to international best practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body.  It derives its authority from the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not from the Constitution itself.  While it works to protect human rights, its legal basis is a statute, not the Constitution's fundamental rights provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The GANHRI accreditation process assesses the performance of national human rights institutions based on various criteria, including their effectiveness in protecting human rights, their adherence to international standards, and their independence and impartiality.  The accreditation process aims to ensure that these institutions meet high standards of human rights protection.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, aims to exclusively involve elected representatives in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  A key component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves conducting structured Gram Sabhas to identify thematic developmental gaps based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) and incorporating a whole-of-government approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While elected representatives are actively involved, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's success hinges on broader participation, including government frontline workers, community-based organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders.  The emphasis is on inclusive participation to ensure the PDPs truly reflect the needs of the community.  The statement oversimplifies the participatory nature of the Abhiyan.

Statement 2 is correct.  The structured Ward Sabha/Mahila Sabha/Gram Sabha/Block Sabha/District Sabha are integral to the process. These gatherings aim to identify developmental gaps using the PDI as a benchmark, aligning with the larger "whole of government and whole of society" approach to localization of SDGs.  The thematic approach ensures a comprehensive and integrated plan.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) solely relies on the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level for auditing local body accounts, without any direct involvement.
2.  The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts and has received international recognition for its contribution to enhancing accountability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG utilizes the ELFA/DLFA for auditing local body accounts, it doesn't imply a lack of direct involvement. The CAG exercises control and supervision over the entire process, providing technical guidance and oversight to ensure the accuracy and effectiveness of the audits. The statement misrepresents the CAG's role as merely passive.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application is a significant initiative aimed at modernizing and streamlining the audit process for panchayat accounts. Its success is evident in its recognition at the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023. The statement accurately reflects the application's purpose and achievement.


**3. With reference to Mercy and Curative Petitions in India's legal system, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed in the Supreme Court only after a review petition has been dismissed, and it primarily addresses procedural irregularities like violations of natural justice.
2.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons only for offenses against laws relating to matters where the executive power of the Union extends, excluding offenses tried by court-martial.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  It is a mechanism to address serious errors of justice, including violations of principles of natural justice or instances where there is a clear apprehension of bias. The statement accurately reflects its function and position within the legal hierarchy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, or to commute a sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  This includes offenses tried by court-martial.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the President's pardon powers.


**4. With reference to the Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs, funded entirely by state governments, are dedicated to handling cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other serious crimes against women.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of cases under the POCSO Act and rape cases, thereby reducing the backlog of such cases in the Indian judicial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs primarily focus on POCSO Act cases and rape cases, their funding is a centrally sponsored scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The statement wrongly attributes the funding to state governments.

Statement 2 is correct. The establishment of FTSCs is directly aimed at reducing the pendency of cases related to sexual offenses against women and children.  The swift disposal of these cases is crucial for ensuring justice and preventing further trauma to victims. The statement accurately identifies the core objective of the FTSCs.


**5. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and its genesis can be traced back to the Supreme Court's recognition of the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19.
2.  The Department of Personnel and Training, under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P), is the sole coordinating agency for the implementation of the RTI Act, 2005, across all states and union territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, indeed superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and the landmark case of *Raj Narayan v. Uttar Pradesh Government* played a significant role in shaping the legal understanding of the right to information, although it didn't explicitly declare it a fundamental right under Article 19.  The statement accurately reflects the historical context and the evolution of the right to information in India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Department of Personnel and Training plays a crucial coordinating role, the implementation of the RTI Act involves multiple agencies at both the central and state levels. The statement overstates the Department's role as the sole coordinating agency.


**6. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) has the power to impose penalties on data fiduciaries for non-compliance, but appeals against its decisions go directly to the Supreme Court.
2.  The Act mandates that data fiduciaries must erase personal data as soon as the purpose for which it was collected is met, irrespective of any legal requirements for retention.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The DPBI does have the power to impose penalties, but appeals against its decisions go to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not directly to the Supreme Court. The statement misrepresents the appellate process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act requires data fiduciaries to erase personal data once the purpose is met, *unless* its retention is necessary for legal reasons.  The statement ignores the important exception regarding legal retention requirements.


**7.  With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their administration falls under the purview of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2.  The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board, responsible for overseeing its civic functions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, their administration falls under the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs. The statement incorrectly identifies the administrative ministry.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board and plays a key role in its administration and civic functions.  The statement accurately describes this relationship.


**8. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A recent Supreme Court judgment recognized the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental right under Article 21, but explicitly excluded the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* expanded the scope of fundamental rights to include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change, drawing upon Articles 14 and 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court judgment did recognize the right to a healthy environment and to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as stemming from Articles 14 and 21. The statement inaccurately claims the exclusion of climate change effects.

Statement 2 is correct. The *M.K. Ranjitsinh* case is a landmark judgment demonstrating the judiciary's proactive role in incorporating environmental concerns within the framework of fundamental rights. The statement accurately reflects the court's approach and the case's significance.


**9. With reference to Grievance Redressal Mechanisms (GRMs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, are the only two designated nodal agencies for handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  The CPGRAMS portal is a centralized online platform for lodging grievances with public authorities, but it is not directly linked to state-level grievance redressal mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances under the Cabinet Secretariat are the primary nodal agencies at the Union Government level for handling public grievances.  The statement accurately reflects the designated agencies' roles.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While CPGRAMS is a centralized platform primarily focused on the Union Government, it does have linkages and integration mechanisms with state-level grievance redressal systems, enabling better coordination and information flow.  The statement misrepresents the interconnectedness of CPGRAMS.


**10. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are primarily focused on delivering government-to-citizen (G2C) services, with limited involvement in business-to-citizen (B2C) or financial services.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), established under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, aims to develop CSCs as a reliable network of citizen service points across rural and urban India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While CSCs play a significant role in delivering G2C services, their functions extend to B2C services (like bill payments and recharges) and financial services (banking, insurance, pensions, etc.).  The statement underestimates the breadth of services offered by CSCs.

Statement 2 is correct. The CSC SPV, under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, has the objective of establishing a widespread network of CSCs to provide accessible services to citizens, particularly focusing on rural areas, but also serving urban populations.  The statement accurately describes the SPV's goal and focus.


**1. With reference to the functioning of the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a statutory body established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, as amended in 2006 and 2019, and its headquarters are in Mumbai.
2. The Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) accreditation for the NHRC was deferred in 2023 primarily due to concerns regarding the insufficient action taken to protect marginalized groups and a lack of diversity in its staff and leadership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the headquarters of the NHRC is in New Delhi, not Mumbai.  The NHRC's establishment and the years of amendment are correctly stated.  The location of the headquarters is a crucial detail often overlooked, making it a suitable distractor in a UPSC-style question.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GANHRI's deferral of accreditation in 2023 is accurately described.  The reasons cited – insufficient action to protect marginalized groups and a lack of diversity – highlight the importance of inclusivity and effectiveness in human rights institutions, a key area of concern for governance and social justice in the UPSC exam.  The focus on these specific shortcomings rather than general criticisms makes the statement more challenging and demands precise knowledge.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in Statement 1.  The inclusion of a seemingly minor factual error (headquarters location) increases the difficulty level of the question and tests the candidate's thorough understanding of the NHRC's structure and functioning.


**2. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Rural Development, aims to enhance people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26, focusing solely on Gram Panchayats.
2. The campaign utilizes a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and employs the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps, with a significant emphasis on the involvement of youth and elderly for handholding in the preparation of GPDPs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as the People's Plan Campaign) falls under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, not the Ministry of Rural Development. This subtle difference tests the candidate's precise knowledge of government ministries and their responsibilities. Secondly, while the campaign's focus is on PDPs, it involves all three tiers of Panchayats (Gram, Block, and District), not solely Gram Panchayats.  This broadens the scope of the campaign beyond what is stated in the first statement.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The thematic approach based on localized SDGs and the use of PDI to identify gaps are accurate. The inclusion of youth and elderly for handholding is also a feature of the campaign.  The statement highlights the inclusive and participatory nature of the initiative, a key element often assessed in UPSC governance questions.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in Statement 1.  The question effectively tests knowledge of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's structure, implementation, and objectives, making it a challenging question for the UPSC exam.



**3. With reference to the powers of the Director-General of Postal Services (DGPS), consider the following statements:**

1. The DGPS has the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services, supply and sale of postage stamps, and can independently decide on the interception of postal articles based on national security concerns.
2.  The Post Office is exempt from liability regarding its services except for liabilities specifically prescribed for services provided by the Post Office; however, the Act includes stringent penal provisions for negligence or misconduct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The DGPS does have the power to make regulations on charges for services and the supply and sale of stamps.  However, the power to intercept postal articles is vested in the government, not solely the DGPS.  The government can intercept based on specified grounds related to national security, public order, etc.  This nuanced distinction makes the statement challenging, requiring a clear understanding of the division of powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Post Office's exemption from liability is accurate, but the statement wrongly claims the Act includes stringent penal provisions. The provided text explicitly states that *there are no penal provisions prescribed in the Act*. This direct contradiction makes this statement easily identifiable as false.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in Statement 2.  The question effectively tests the candidate's understanding of the DGPS's powers within the context of the overall postal system's legal framework, demanding specific knowledge and analytical skills.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was a direct outcome of the recommendations of the Nehru Committee, aiming to grant autonomy to tribal areas within specific states.
2. The Sixth Schedule provisions are applicable only to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, and it primarily deals with the establishment of autonomous district councils with legislative and administrative powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was a result of the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee. This difference in committee attribution is a key detail that distinguishes between accurate and inaccurate knowledge of constitutional provisions. The aim of granting autonomy to tribal areas is correct, but the committee's identity is crucial for a correct answer.

Statement 2 is largely correct. While the Sixth Schedule's application extends to Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, the statement correctly identifies its primary purpose: the establishment of autonomous district councils with specific legislative and administrative powers.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the error in Statement 1. The question tests not only knowledge of the Sixth Schedule's content but also the historical context of its creation, demanding a higher level of understanding and recall.



**5. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) granted to states, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1971 based on the recommendations of the Fourth Finance Commission, primarily to address the geographical and socio-economic disadvantages faced by specific states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission abolished the SCS category, and the current special funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, not on their SCS status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SCS was first introduced in 1969, based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Fourth. This seemingly minor detail concerning the commission number highlights the need for precise factual recall. The description of the purpose of the SCS is correct.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendation to abolish the SCS category and the subsequent shift to a funding pattern based on the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers' recommendations are accurately reflected. This highlights the evolving nature of fiscal federalism in India.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in Statement 1.  The question effectively tests knowledge of the evolution of the SCS and its replacement with alternative funding mechanisms, demanding both factual knowledge and an understanding of fiscal policy.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and the Central Information Commission (CIC) members are appointed by the President based on a recommendation from the Lok Sabha Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister.
2.  Every citizen has the right to request information from a Public Authority (PA), and the definition of PAs includes all government bodies, state-controlled entities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) substantially financed by the central or state governments. However, cooperative societies are always explicitly excluded.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002. However, the composition of the committee recommending the appointment of CIC members is inaccurate. The committee consists of the Prime Minister (Chairperson), the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister.  The inclusion of the Rajya Sabha Leader of Opposition and the Lok Sabha Speaker is incorrect. This highlights the need for precise knowledge of the appointment process.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The right to request information from a PA and the broad definition of PAs encompassing government bodies, state-controlled entities, and substantially financed NGOs are accurate.  However, the statement incorrectly asserts that cooperative societies are *always* explicitly excluded.  The status of cooperative societies as PAs can vary depending on specific court rulings and interpretations of the Act. This makes the statement partially correct but still a better option compared to option 1.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect. The question tests knowledge of the RTI Act's key provisions, its historical context, and the nuances of the definition of Public Authorities, making it a challenging question.


**7. With reference to the  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI has the power to impose penalties for data breaches and hear grievances from affected persons, but its decisions are final and cannot be appealed.
2.  Data fiduciaries (entities determining the purpose and means of processing personal data) are obligated to ensure data accuracy, build security safeguards, and inform the DPBI and affected persons in case of a breach.  They are also required to retain personal data indefinitely to ensure comprehensive records.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because appeals against the DPBI's decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT).  The statement incorrectly states that the DPBI's decisions are final, omitting the crucial appellate process.

Statement 2 is incorrect because data fiduciaries are obligated to erase personal data as soon as the purpose is met and retention is not necessary for legal purposes. The statement incorrectly claims they must retain data indefinitely. This is a crucial distinction concerning data privacy and compliance.

Both statements contain significant factual inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.  The question effectively tests knowledge of the DPBI's powers and the obligations of data fiduciaries under the data protection framework, requiring precise and detailed understanding.


**8. With reference to the Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi, launched in 2020 under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, aims to create a future-ready civil service by focusing exclusively on rule-based training and capacity building for all contractual employees of the Union Government.
2. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC), established as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), completed three years in 2024 and plays a crucial role in implementing the competency-driven approach of Mission Karmayogi.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect for several reasons.  First, Mission Karmayogi was launched in 2021, not 2020.  Second, it aims to create a future-ready civil service by shifting *from* rule-based *to* role-based training and capacity building, not exclusively focusing on rule-based training. Third, it covers *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, not only contractual employees.  These multiple inaccuracies make this statement false.

Statement 2 is correct. The CBC's establishment as part of the NPCSCB, its completion of three years in 2024, and its role in implementing the competency-driven approach are all accurate.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracies in Statement 1.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of Mission Karmayogi's goals, implementation mechanisms, and the role of the CBC, requiring detailed knowledge.


**9. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs, established under the Ministry of Rural Development, are primarily focused on providing IT-enabled services to urban citizens and form one of the four pillars of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP).
2. CSCs offer a wide range of services, including G2C (government-to-citizen) services like Aadhaar services and ITR filing, B2C (business-to-citizen) services like mobile recharges, and financial services like banking and insurance.  However, they do not facilitate access to any social sector services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  First, CSCs are under the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  Second, CSCs primarily serve *rural* citizens, not urban citizens, and they constitute one of the *three*, not four, pillars of the NeGP.

Statement 2 is incorrect because CSCs do facilitate access to social sector services.  The statement incorrectly claims they do not.

Both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct option.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the CSC scheme's objectives, target population, and the services offered, requiring a thorough understanding of the digital governance initiative.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to accelerate people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26.
2.  A key component of the Abhiyan involves structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas at the village level, but excludes Block and District level Sabhas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign), initiated in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is designed to enhance citizen participation in the creation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  Its focus is on ensuring that PDPs reflect the needs and priorities of the local communities.  The 2025-26 PDP preparation is a significant current application of this initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, and Gram Sabhas are indeed crucial components for preparing the Gram Panchayat Development Plan (GPDP), the Abhiyan also explicitly includes Block Sabhas and District Sabhas for preparing Block and District Panchayat Development Plans respectively.  The Abhiyan's structure is designed to facilitate a multi-tiered participatory planning process, moving from the village level up to the district level.  The omission of Block and District level Sabhas in the statement is a key factual inaccuracy.


**2. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such center globally, aiming to establish international benchmarks for auditing local governance.
2.  iCAL's establishment is primarily driven by the need to address the lack of transparency and accountability in local government finances, especially in rural areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While iCAL is indeed the first such center in India, the claim that it is the first globally is unsubstantiated.  Many international organizations and institutions already focus on establishing best practices and standards for auditing local governance worldwide.  The statement overstates iCAL's global significance.

Statement 2 is correct. A primary motivation behind establishing iCAL is to improve transparency and accountability in the financial management of local government bodies. This is particularly relevant in India's context, where significant funds are allocated to local governance, and robust auditing mechanisms are essential to ensure effective utilization of resources and prevent corruption.


**3. With reference to Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee were first established concurrently in 1921 as a direct outcome of the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms.
2. The Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL), established in 1976, comprises an equal number of members from the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PAC was indeed established in 1921 following the Montague-Chelmsford Reforms. However, the Estimates Committee was first constituted much later, in 1950. The statement incorrectly claims their simultaneous establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PCOL was indeed established in 1976 under Section 4 of the Official Languages Act, 1963, its membership is not equally divided between Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha.  The committee's composition is 20 members from the Lok Sabha and 10 from the Rajya Sabha, reflecting the larger representation of the Lok Sabha.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the President of India's powers regarding mercy petitions:**

1.  Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only in cases where the conviction is by a court-martial.
2. The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases involving offenses against any law relating to matters under the executive power of the Union, but not to cases tried by state courts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72's scope is broader than just court-martial convictions.  It explicitly includes cases where the sentence is by a court-martial *or* for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a death sentence.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 72's power extends to cases tried by both Union and State courts as long as the offense falls under the Union's executive power or involves a death sentence.  The statement erroneously limits the President's jurisdiction to only Union-level offenses.


**5. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition is the final legal recourse available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it is based on the Supreme Court's inherent power under Article 142.
2.  The grounds for filing a curative petition include the violation of principles of natural justice, judge misconduct, or the apprehension of bias leading to an adverse judgment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort available after a review petition's dismissal by the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's power under Article 142, which allows it to do complete justice, is the basis for this extraordinary remedy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The grounds for filing a curative petition are specifically linked to procedural irregularities or potential biases that could have affected the fairness of the original judgment.  These include violations of natural justice, judge misconduct (such as undisclosed connections), or apprehensions of bias.


**6. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs, established under a centrally sponsored scheme, exclusively handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The funding for FTSCs is entirely borne by the respective state governments, ensuring flexibility in resource allocation based on regional needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs significantly expedite cases under the POCSO Act, they are not exclusively limited to such cases. They also efficiently handle other rape cases.  The statement incorrectly restricts the court's jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  FTSCs are funded primarily through the Nirbhaya Fund, a centrally managed fund. While states may contribute, the central government bears the primary financial responsibility. The statement incorrectly attributes funding solely to state governments.


**7. Consider the following statements comparing First-Past-The-Post (FPTP) and Proportional Representation (PR) electoral systems:**

1.  In FPTP systems, a party can win more seats than its vote share indicates, leading to over-representation, while PR systems ensure a direct proportionality between votes and seats.
2.  FPTP systems generally lead to more stable governments due to the formation of clear majorities, whereas PR systems often result in coalition governments which may be less stable.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. FPTP systems can lead to disproportionate seat allocation, where a party may secure a majority of seats even with less than 50% of the total votes.  PR systems aim to rectify this by allocating seats proportionally to the votes received by each party.

Statement 2 is also correct. FPTP frequently produces a single-party majority government, contributing to stability.  In contrast, PR systems often lead to multi-party coalitions, which can be more susceptible to instability due to the potential for internal disagreements and power struggles within the coalition.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, enacted in 1950, provides for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils in certain tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2.  The establishment of Autonomous District Councils under the Sixth Schedule is primarily intended to promote economic development and improve the educational standards of tribal populations, without any focus on preserving their traditional customary laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, part of the Constitution since its inception, lays out provisions for establishing Autonomous District Councils in specific tribal regions across four northeastern states. These councils enjoy significant autonomy in managing local affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While economic development and education are important considerations, the Sixth Schedule also explicitly aims to safeguard and preserve the unique customary laws and traditions of the tribal communities it covers.  The statement erroneously excludes this crucial aspect of the Sixth Schedule's objectives.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India:**

1. CSSs are schemes jointly funded by the central and state governments, implemented by the states, and exclusively operate within the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is largely based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, formed in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSSs are indeed jointly funded and implemented by states, but they operate in sectors falling under both the State List and the Concurrent List of the Constitution, not exclusively the Union List. The statement incorrectly restricts the scope of CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct. The current structure of CSSs largely draws upon the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, established in 2015, which aimed to streamline and rationalize these schemes.


**10. With reference to Special Category States (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was first introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Third Finance Commission, primarily focusing on providing additional financial assistance to states with unique geographical and socio-economic challenges.
2.  The constitutional basis for designating a state as an SCS is explicitly mentioned in Article 370 of the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The concept of SCS was indeed introduced in 1969, but it was based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, not the Third.  The statement contains an error in the Finance Commission number.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There is no explicit constitutional provision for designating a state as an SCS. The provision of special status to states is based on various articles, including Article 282 which allows for discretionary grants, and provisions under Articles 371 and related articles. Article 370 is specifically related to the former state of Jammu and Kashmir.  The statement incorrectly identifies a specific article as the constitutional basis.



**1. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar metadata, as per the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment, can be retained indefinitely for national security purposes.
2. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v UoI* explicitly stated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months.  The court emphasized the importance of protecting citizen's privacy and limiting data retention. While national security is a valid concern, the court did not grant unlimited data retention for Aadhaar.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The Supreme Court ruling clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be forcibly imposed for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  The judgment aimed to balance the benefits of Aadhaar with the protection of fundamental rights.  The government cannot compel citizens to link Aadhaar to these services.


**2. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are exclusively funded by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
2. The current framework of CSSs is based on the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments, not exclusively by the Centre.  Furthermore, they are implemented through state governments in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, not solely the Union List.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The current framework of CSSs is based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the Fourteenth Finance Commission. While the Fourteenth Finance Commission's recommendations led to the cessation of Special Category Status (SCS) for states, the existing CSS structure is rooted in the 2015 report.


**3. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The constitutional provision for categorizing states as SCS states is explicitly mentioned in Article 370.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants to SCS states before the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution does not contain any explicit provision for categorizing states as SCS states.  While special provisions exist under Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J for various states, these are distinct from the now-defunct SCS categorization. Article 370 specifically related to the temporary provisions for Jammu and Kashmir, which are now repealed.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the basis for calculating grants provided to SCS states prior to the Fourteenth Finance Commission's recommendations.  This formula was subsequently replaced as the SCS itself was abolished.


**4.  With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule grants autonomy to tribal areas within specified states by establishing autonomous district councils.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), stemmed from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee. The Bardoloi Committee was specifically tasked with addressing the governance challenges in Assam's tribal areas.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Sixth Schedule establishes autonomous district councils in certain states, granting significant autonomy to the tribal populations within those areas.  These councils have powers over local governance, land management, and other crucial aspects impacting the tribal communities.


**5. With reference to Parliamentary Committees in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Estimates Committee was first constituted in 1921 as a consequence of the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms.
2. The Public Accounts Committee comprises an equal number of members from the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was first established in 1921 following the Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms, not the Estimates Committee. The Estimates Committee was formed later, in 1950.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Public Accounts Committee does not have an equal number of members from both houses of Parliament. It consists of a larger number of members from the Lok Sabha (15) compared to the Rajya Sabha (7).  This reflects the Lok Sabha's greater representation in the legislative process.


**6. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to improve the efficiency of government service delivery at the district level.
2. The campaign employs a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does indirectly contribute to better service delivery, its primary aim is to accelerate people's participation in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs), not solely to improve efficiency at the district level. The focus is on grassroots-level planning and involvement.

Statement 2 is correct. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan utilizes a thematic approach rooted in the localization of SDGs. This ensures that the Panchayat Development Plans align with broader national development goals, adapting them to the specific needs and contexts of different panchayats.


**7. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only for offenses against laws relating to matters under the concurrent list.
2. The President's power under Article 72 extends to all death sentences, regardless of the court that imposed them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends, not solely those under the concurrent list. This includes both Union and state laws in certain circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. The President's power under Article 72 explicitly encompasses all death sentences, irrespective of whether they were imposed by a court-martial or a civilian court. This reflects the President's role as the supreme executive authority.


**8. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems from its inherent powers under Article 142.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court, not a writ petition.  The review petition is the immediate preceding remedy before resorting to a curative petition, which is the last resort.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions is derived from its inherent power under Article 142 to do complete justice. This is a unique power that allows the court to address exceptional circumstances where other remedies have failed to provide adequate redress.


**9. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are exclusively funded by state governments, with no central government contribution.
2. The primary objective of FTSCs is to ensure the swift disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and other sexual offenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning that the central government bears the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund. While states implement them, the funding is primarily from the Centre.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core objective of FTSCs is to expedite the disposal of cases involving rape and those falling under the POCSO Act.  This is crucial for ensuring timely justice and preventing prolonged suffering for victims.


**10. With reference to Passports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports is solely governed by the Passport Act, 1967, with no provision for exemptions.
2.  Diplomatic passports are issued in green color.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Passport Act, 1967, primarily governs passport issuance, the central government retains the power to exempt certain individuals from the passport requirement if deemed necessary in the public interest.  This flexibility is important for handling special cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Diplomatic passports in India are issued in white color, not green.  Different colors are used to distinguish between different types of passports (ordinary, diplomatic, and official).


**11. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on delivering government services to urban populations in India.
2. The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are designed to provide a wide range of services to rural citizens of India, not just urban populations.  Their aim is to bridge the digital divide and make essential services accessible in remote areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSC SPV was established under the Companies Act, 1956, not the Information Technology Act, 2000.  This reflects its structure as a special purpose vehicle (SPV), a common organizational structure in India.


**12. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonments are exclusively administered by the state governments in which they are located.
2. The first Cantonment in India, Barrackpore, was established after the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonments are administered under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the state governments. The local self-government of cantonments falls under the Union Government's purview.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Barrackpore Cantonment was established in 1765 by the East India Company, well before the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857.  The establishment of cantonments predates the mutiny by almost a century.


**13. With reference to the Supreme Court's judgment on environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court's recent judgment explicitly linked the right to a healthy environment with Article 21 only.
2. The judgment concerned the protection of the Asiatic Lion and its habitat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's judgment linked the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change to both Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), not just Article 21. This broadened the scope of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The judgment in question concerned the protection of the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat, not the Asiatic Lion.  The case highlighted the importance of conserving endangered species and their ecosystems.


**14. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and the latter's provisions are still in effect.
2.  The Supreme Court, in the case of *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government*, established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 19.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, effectively rendering the latter's provisions obsolete.  The 2005 Act is the current and operative law on this subject.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court, in *Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government*, did indeed recognize the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression). This landmark judgment laid the groundwork for the enactment of the RTI Act.



**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to exclusively involve elected representatives in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Panchayat level, which are then presented in Gram Sabhas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While elected representatives are actively involved, the Jan Yojana Abhiyan's implementation involves a broader range of stakeholders, including government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other relevant participants.  The aim is inclusive participation, not exclusive reliance on elected officials.

Statement 2 is correct. A crucial component of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is the use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify specific thematic developmental needs at the Gram Panchayat level. These identified gaps are then presented and discussed in Gram Sabhas to ensure grassroots participation in planning. The PDI serves as a tool for evidence-based planning and prioritization.  The thematic approach aligns with the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Gram Nyayalayas:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, but excludes all tribal areas.
2. Appeals from Gram Nyayalayas are heard by the High Court in civil cases and the Court of Session in criminal cases, with a mandated six-month disposal period.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and handle both civil and criminal matters, their jurisdiction does *not* exclude *all* tribal areas. The Act specifically exempts certain tribal areas, not all. This nuanced difference makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The appellate jurisdiction for Gram Nyayalaya decisions is to the District Court in civil cases and the Court of Session in criminal cases. While a six-month disposal period is aimed for, it's not a legally mandated, fixed timeframe. The statement misrepresents the timeframe as a legally binding requirement.


**3. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court, regardless of whether it directly interferes with a specific court proceeding.
2. The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish contempt is derived solely from the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Civil contempt focuses on the willful disobedience of court orders or undertakings. Criminal contempt, however, encompasses a broader range of actions that undermine the court's authority, including scandalizing or lowering its prestige, even if there's no direct interference with a specific ongoing case.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides a framework for dealing with contempt, the inherent power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish contempt also stems from Articles 129 and 215 of the Indian Constitution respectively.  The Act supplements, but doesn't solely define, this constitutional power.


**4. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar metadata, which includes details like caste, religion, and income, can be stored indefinitely to improve service delivery.
2. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared Aadhaar mandatory for accessing all government services, including opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar metadata does *not* include details like caste, religion, and income; it is intentionally designed to be minimal.  Furthermore, the Supreme Court's 2018 judgment mandated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, directly contradicting the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment upheld the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but explicitly stated that Aadhaar is *not* mandatory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile connections.  While it is mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, the statement incorrectly broadens this mandate to all government services.


**5.  With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs are schemes funded entirely by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed in the Union List of the Constitution.
2. The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, which introduced a new formula for distributing funds to states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS) are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The statement incorrectly claims that they are funded solely by the central government.  Moreover, they are implemented in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, not just the Union List.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The current framework for CSSs is primarily based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the 14th Finance Commission. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of CSSs as a distinct category, although some special funding arrangements for certain states continue.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1. iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such center in India and aims to establish international standards for auditing local government bodies.
2. iCAL's primary function is to conduct audits of local government accounts and ensure the accountability of local bodies in utilizing funds granted by the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
  (a) 1 only
  (b) 2 only
  (c) Both 1 and 2
  (d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. iCAL is indeed the first of its kind in India, aiming to set global benchmarks for auditing local governance. Its role is to enhance capacity building and establish best practices, contributing to improved financial management and service delivery in local bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  iCAL does not directly conduct audits of local government accounts. Its role is more focused on capacity building, knowledge sharing, and establishing standards. The actual auditing of local bodies is primarily undertaken by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) and other designated state-level agencies.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, based on the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, applies to all states in Northeast India, granting them special autonomy in administration.
2.  The Sixth Schedule's provisions focus primarily on financial matters, providing special financial assistance to the scheduled areas but not on administrative arrangements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule applies to specific tribal areas in four states of Northeast India (Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram), not to all states in the region. It establishes autonomous district councils with significant administrative and legislative powers, not just special autonomy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's provisions are not limited to financial matters. It deals with the establishment of autonomous district councils, granting them considerable administrative and legislative authority over their respective areas, including matters relating to land, forest, and local governance.


**8.  With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The concept of SCS was introduced in 1969 based on the recommendations of the Fifth Finance Commission, and these states were granted special financial assistance based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.
2. The Constitution explicitly categorizes certain states as SCS, providing them with special provisions under Articles 370, 371A to 371H, and 371J.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The concept of Special Category States (SCS) originated in 1969 based on the Fifth Finance Commission's recommendations.  These states received special financial assistance, often calculated using the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.  While the formula has evolved, the core concept of differential treatment for certain states remains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly categorize any state as an SCS.  While Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J provide special provisions for certain states, these are not based on a formal "SCS" designation mentioned in the Constitution itself. The special provisions are distinct from the historical concept of SCS.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) and the Estimates Committee:**

1. The PAC, first established in 1921, consists of members from both houses of Parliament, with a majority from the Lok Sabha. Its primary function is to audit the revenue and expenditure of the Government of India.
2. The Estimates Committee, established in 1950, comprises solely of Lok Sabha members and focuses on examining the efficiency of government administration and the effective use of funds allocated in the budget estimates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PAC was indeed first set up in 1921 and has members from both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, with the Lok Sabha having a majority. Its primary role is to scrutinize the government's revenue and expenditure, ensuring accountability.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Estimates Committee was established in 1950 and consists exclusively of Lok Sabha members. Its role is to review the government's budget estimates, assess the efficiency of government programs, and suggest improvements in administrative practices to ensure better utilization of public funds.


**10. With reference to Mercy Petitions and Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A mercy petition, under Article 72 of the Constitution, can only be filed with the President for offenses against laws relating to matters under the executive power of the Union.
2. A curative petition is the last resort for a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, primarily addressing violations of natural justice or judicial bias.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 allows the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., not only for offenses under Union executive power but also for those tried by court-martial or state courts.  The statement unnecessarily limits the scope of Article 72.

Statement 2 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the final legal recourse available after the dismissal of a review petition by the Supreme Court.  It is typically used to address exceptional circumstances like demonstrable violations of natural justice or clear evidence of judicial bias that could not be raised earlier.  The statement accurately reflects its purpose and limitations.


**11. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and its coordinating agency is the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. The Supreme Court's judgment in the case of "Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government" established the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, its coordinating agency is the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions (MoPPG&P), not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's landmark judgment in "Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government" did recognize the right to information as integral to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a).  This ruling significantly influenced the enactment of the RTI Act.


**12. With reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, primarily aim to streamline the process for granting Indian citizenship to refugees from all countries facing religious persecution.
2.  Applicants seeking citizenship under these rules must demonstrate adequate knowledge of at least one language specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, implement the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, focusing on granting citizenship to religious minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian) who have fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.  The statement incorrectly broadens the scope to include refugees from all countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  One of the requirements for applying for citizenship under these rules is demonstrating adequate knowledge of one of the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.  This is a key eligibility criterion.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC):**

1. The NCBC is a constitutional body established under Part XIV of the Constitution, tasked with safeguarding the interests of Other Backward Classes (OBCs).
2.  The NCBC has the power to issue directions to the Central Government and State Governments on matters relating to OBCs, and its decisions are legally binding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NCBC is *not* a constitutional body. It was established by a constitutional amendment (102nd Amendment Act of 2018)  and operates under a separate Act of Parliament, not as part of Part XIV of the Constitution.  The statement misrepresents its constitutional status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the NCBC can issue directions to the Central and State Governments, its decisions are not automatically legally binding.  Its recommendations hold significant weight, but they are not enforceable in the same manner as court orders.  The statement overstates the binding nature of its decisions.


**14. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments and operate under the supervision of the respective state High Courts.
2. FTSCs were primarily established to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, with a secondary focus on rape cases.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning they are primarily funded by the central government (from the Nirbhaya Fund) and operate under the overall supervision of the Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice.  State governments may contribute, but the primary funding and oversight are at the central level.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs were established to expedite the disposal of *both* rape cases and cases under the POCSO Act.  The statement incorrectly prioritizes POCSO cases over rape cases, implying a secondary focus on the latter.  Both are equally important objectives.


**1. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and their jurisdiction extends to both civil and criminal matters, but excludes all tribal areas in India.
2.  The Nyayadhikari of a Gram Nyayalaya is appointed by the State Governor in consultation with the Chief Justice of the respective High Court, and these courts are bound by the principles of natural justice but not necessarily by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas are indeed established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, and possess jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters,  the Act *exempts* certain States and specified tribal areas, not *all* tribal areas in India.  The exclusion is specifically mentioned in the Act, not a blanket exclusion of all tribal areas. This makes the statement factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The Nyayadhikari is appointed by the State government (not the Governor alone) in consultation with the High Court.  Crucially, Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the technical rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but operate under the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and due process.  This aspect of the statement is accurate. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt involves the willful disobedience of a court's order, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court, but does not include actions that obstruct the administration of justice.
2. The power of the Supreme Court and High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution, respectively, and is defined exclusively under the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While civil contempt accurately describes willful disobedience of court orders, the description of criminal contempt is incomplete. Criminal contempt *does* include actions that obstruct the administration of justice,  along with scandalizing or lowering the court's authority or prejudicing judicial proceedings.  The statement omits a key element of the definition.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Articles 129 and 215 do indeed grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt. However, the statement incorrectly claims that the definition of contempt is *exclusively* found in the Contempt of Courts Act, 1971.  The Constitutional provisions themselves provide the foundational basis for this power, with the Act providing further details and procedures.  The statement oversimplifies the legal basis. Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to Mercy Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offences against laws related to matters under the executive power of the Union, excluding offences tried by court-martial.
2. The President's power to grant mercy extends to all sentences, including those awarded by courts-martial and those relating to matters where the executive power of the Union extends, but not those involving offences under state laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly includes the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences for offenses tried by court-martial.  The statement wrongly excludes this crucial aspect of the President's power.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The President's power under Article 72 is not limited to offenses under Union laws; it extends to sentences awarded by courts-martial and those related to matters under the Union's executive power. However, it does *not* extend to all offenses under state laws.  The President's power is specifically defined within the constitutional framework, and this statement overstates its reach.  Consequently, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**4. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition under Article 137 has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, and it can be filed only if there is evidence of a violation of principles of natural justice or judicial bias by the judge.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions is derived from Article 142 of the Constitution, which empowers the Court to do complete justice, and it was established in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition serves as the final legal recourse after the dismissal of a review petition under Article 137. It is available when a petitioner can demonstrate significant procedural irregularities such as a violation of principles of natural justice or evidence of judicial bias (including undisclosed connections or apprehension of bias).


Statement 2 is also correct. The Supreme Court's authority to hear curative petitions stems from its inherent power under Article 142 to ensure complete justice.  The landmark case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra & Anr* is indeed where the contours of curative petitions were defined and established. Thus, both statements are accurate.


**5. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments and are primarily focused on the speedy disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. FTSCs, a centrally sponsored scheme launched in 2019 and extended until 2026, aim to expedite the disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act, with a significant number operational across various states and union territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not funded solely by state governments.  While they are crucial for the speedy resolution of POCSO Act cases, their mandate also includes other rape cases, making the statement's focus too narrow.


Statement 2 is correct.  The FTSC scheme was indeed launched in 2019, with its extension to 2026, and aims to ensure the swift trial of rape and POCSO Act cases. The information provided about the number of operational courts across states and union territories aligns with factual reports. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA grants citizenship to illegal migrants from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan who are Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, or Christians, and who entered India before December 31, 2014, but excludes those residing in tribal areas specified in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution.
2. The CAA reduces the naturalization period for eligible migrants from 11 years to 5 years, and it provides the central government with the authority to cancel Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) registration on specific grounds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAA provides a path to citizenship for illegal migrants who meet specific religious and geographical criteria, including the timeframe of entry before December 31, 2014, and exclusion from specified tribal areas under the Sixth Schedule.  This accurately reflects the Act's provisions.


Statement 2 is also correct. The CAA does indeed reduce the naturalization period for the specified group of migrants.  Furthermore, it empowers the central government to revoke OCI registration under defined circumstances.  Both aspects are factually accurate representations of the CAA's provisions. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**7. With reference to Lokpal in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lokpal's inquiry wing conducts preliminary inquiries into offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, and submits its report within 90 days, while the prosecution wing is headed by the Director of Prosecution, who files cases before designated special courts.
2. The Lokpal has the power to supervise and direct central investigation agencies, including the CBI, for cases referred to it, and it also serves as the final appellate authority for corruption-related grievances, but lacks the power to issue directions to public servants regarding document protection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lokpal's inquiry wing does investigate offenses under the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988, the timeframe for submitting reports is 60 days, not 90 days. The statement incorrectly states the time limit. The description of the prosecution wing's role is accurate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Lokpal does have the power to supervise and direct central investigation agencies like the CBI and acts as the final appellate authority for certain corruption-related grievances.  However, it *does* have the power to issue directions to public servants for the protection and preservation of documents. The statement incorrectly claims it lacks this power.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**8. With reference to the National Commission for Backward Classes (NCBC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCBC's powers include inquiring into complaints regarding the denial of benefits to backward classes, but it lacks the authority to recommend reservation policies or quotas for any particular group.
2. The NCBC is a constitutional body established under Article 338B of the Constitution, and its Chairperson and members are appointed by the President of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCBC's powers are not limited to merely inquiring into complaints. It has a broader mandate, which includes making recommendations to the government on matters related to the welfare and advancement of backward classes. This may include aspects of reservation policies, though the final decision rests with the government. The statement understates the NCBC's authority.


Statement 2 is correct. The NCBC is a constitutional body established under Article 338B, and its members, including the Chairperson, are appointed by the President of India.  This is a factual and accurate description. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and it mandates that all public authorities proactively disclose certain categories of information, but it does not require the maintenance of records by all public authorities.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is appointed by the President on the recommendation of a committee comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister, and its members serve for a term of five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and it does mandate proactive disclosure of information by public authorities.  Crucially, it *also* requires public authorities to maintain records; this is a fundamental requirement for the Act's implementation. The statement incorrectly omits this key aspect.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President appoints the CIC on the recommendation of the specified committee, the tenure of CIC members is three years, not five years. The statement contains an inaccurate detail regarding the tenure. Therefore, neither statement is entirely correct.


**10. With reference to sub-classification of Scheduled Castes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that sub-classification of Scheduled Castes is permissible under Article 341(1) of the Constitution, provided it aims to address the varying degrees of backwardness within the SC community and is based on demonstrable inadequacy of representation in state services.
2.  Sub-classification of Scheduled Castes does not violate Article 341(2) because this article allows Parliament to include or exclude castes from the list of Scheduled Castes, but it does not explicitly prohibit sub-classification within the existing list.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Supreme Court's ruling allows for sub-classification within the Scheduled Castes if it addresses the varying levels of backwardness and is supported by evidence of inadequate representation in government services. The ruling emphasizes the need for a justifiable basis for such sub-classification, avoiding arbitrary or politically motivated decisions.


Statement 2 is also correct. Article 341(2) provides Parliament with the power to modify the list of Scheduled Castes.  The absence of an explicit prohibition on sub-classification within the existing list has been interpreted as implicitly allowing such sub-classification under certain conditions, provided it meets the criteria of addressing backwardness and is not arbitrary. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**11. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and their administration falls under the purview of the State Governments, with the Station Commander serving as the ex-officio President of the Board.
2. Cantonments were initially established by the British East India Company, and currently, there are 62 cantonments in India, all of which are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are indeed administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, their administration falls under the *Union* Government (not State Governments), reflecting the national security implications of these areas. The Station Commander is correctly identified as the ex-officio President.


Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Cantonments were established by the British East India Company. However, the current number of cantonments in India is 61 (not 62), and while they are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, the statement omits the crucial point that local self-governance within cantonments is a matter for the Union Government.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.


**12. With reference to the constitutionalization of environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has held that the right to a healthy environment is implicit within Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution, and this right extends to protection from the adverse effects of climate change, but does not encompass the right to equality under Article 14.
2.  The Supreme Court's judgment in *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others* exemplifies how the Court has used its power of judicial review to expand the scope of fundamental rights to include environmental protection, primarily focusing on the right to life.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court has indeed recognized the right to a healthy environment as implicit within Article 21, extending it to protection from climate change's adverse effects.  However, the statement mistakenly excludes the connection to Article 14 (Right to Equality).  The Court's reasoning often involves the concept that environmental degradation disproportionately affects certain groups, invoking principles of equality.


Statement 2 is correct. The *M.K. Ranjitsinh* case serves as a prime example of the Supreme Court's proactive role in expanding the scope of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.  The Court's judgment demonstrates the application of judicial review in upholding environmental protection, particularly emphasizing the right to life (Article 21).  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**13. With reference to Plea Bargaining under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. Plea bargaining under the BNSS, 2023, is applicable to all offenses, irrespective of the sentence involved, and the application must be made within 60 days of the framing of charges.
2. The BNSS, 2023, introduces time-bound plea bargaining applicable to offenses punishable by up to seven years of imprisonment, with certain exclusions including crimes against women and children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The BNSS, 2023, does *not* make plea bargaining applicable to all offenses.  There are specific limitations, notably excluding certain serious offenses.  The timeframe for application is also incorrect; it's 30 days, not 60 days.


Statement 2 is correct. The BNSS, 2023, introduces a time-bound framework for plea bargaining, restricting it to offenses with a maximum sentence of seven years.  Importantly, it explicitly excludes certain categories of crimes, including those against women and children, and socio-economic offenses.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**14. With reference to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Act prohibits anticipatory bail for all offenses under the Act, regardless of whether a prima facie case is made out against the accused, and it mandates special courts for the trial of offenses under the Act.
2. The Act aims to prevent atrocities against members of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, defining offenses such as employing members of SC/STs for manual scavenging and dedicating SC/ST women as devadasis, and provides for punishment for public servants who neglect their duties under the Act.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act's bar on anticipatory bail is *not* absolute.  The Supreme Court has clarified that the bar applies only when a prima facie case is established against the accused. The statement incorrectly presents the bail provision as unconditional. The provision for special courts is accurate.


Statement 2 is correct. The Act's primary purpose is the prevention of atrocities against SC/ST members.  It defines various offenses, including those mentioned in the statement, and it does include provisions for punishing public servants who fail to perform their duties under the Act. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**15. With reference to Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the fiscal year 2025-26, primarily focusing on Gram Sabhas and excluding Block and District level Sabhas.
2.  The campaign employs a thematic approach based on localized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps, with a focus on inclusive participation of all age groups.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jan Yojana Abhiyan does aim to enhance people's participation in preparing PDPs for 2025-26,  its scope is not limited to Gram Sabhas.  It actively involves Block and District level Sabhas as well, making the statement's description incomplete and inaccurate.


Statement 2 is correct. The campaign uses a thematic approach rooted in localized SDGs and employs the PDI to pinpoint developmental shortcomings.  Importantly, it emphasizes inclusive participation, including youth and the elderly.  This aligns with the campaign's objectives. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**1. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations determine the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, including corporation tax and personal income tax, between the Union and States.
2.  Horizontal devolution, as per the 15th Finance Commission, allocates funds among states based solely on population (2011 census) and geographical area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 270 of the Indian Constitution mandates that the Finance Commission recommend the distribution of net proceeds of certain taxes (including corporation tax and personal income tax) between the Union and the States. This forms a crucial aspect of India's fiscal federalism.  The Finance Commission's recommendations are crucial in determining the share of resources that each level of government receives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While population (2011 census) and geographical area are indeed factors considered in horizontal devolution by the 15th Finance Commission, they are not the *sole* criteria.  The 15th Finance Commission used a multi-criteria approach,  weighing various factors including Income Distance, Area, Population (2011), Demographic performance, Forest and Ecology, and Tax and fiscal efforts, each with a specific weight assigned to it.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the complex formula used for horizontal devolution.  The use of multiple criteria reflects the multifaceted nature of development needs across different Indian states.


**2. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria and process for granting Special Category Status to states.
2. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the continuation of the SCS system, with several states retaining their SCS status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain any provision explicitly defining the criteria or process for granting Special Category Status (SCS) to states.  The SCS was a classification devised and implemented by the central government based on the recommendations of various Finance Commissions, primarily to provide additional financial and developmental assistance to states facing socio-economic and geographical disadvantages.  The lack of constitutional basis makes the SCS system inherently flexible and susceptible to political considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of the SCS system.  Consequently, no state currently holds SCS.  The current special funding patterns to Northeastern and Himalayan states are based on different recommendations, not the continuation of the SCS framework. This shift reflects a move towards a more standardized and transparent system of intergovernmental financial transfers.


**3. With reference to the borrowing powers of the Union and State Governments in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  State governments can borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the approval of the Union government.
2.  If a state government is already indebted to the Union government, it requires prior consent from the Union government before undertaking any further borrowing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution allows state governments to borrow money only *within* India, not from foreign sources. This restriction aims to maintain macroeconomic stability and prevent excessive external debt accumulation by states. The Union government's role in regulating state borrowings is significant to ensure fiscal discipline across the country.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 293 explicitly states that a state government cannot borrow money if it is already indebted to the Union government without the prior consent of the Union government.  This provision safeguards the Union's financial interests and helps prevent states from accumulating unsustainable levels of debt.  This highlights the hierarchical nature of the Indian federal system in matters of finance.


**4. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSCs) scheme in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are primarily focused on providing government services to urban populations, leveraging technology to enhance citizen engagement in cities.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) was established by the Ministry of Rural Development to oversee the implementation of the CSC scheme.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CSC scheme is designed to provide a wide range of government, private, and social sector services to citizens in *rural* areas, with a particular focus on bridging the digital divide.  While some urban areas might utilize CSCs, the core objective is to extend the reach of government services to underserved rural communities.  This focus on rural development is central to the scheme's philosophy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSC SPV was established by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  This reflects the technological aspects of the scheme, aiming to leverage information technology to enhance service delivery. The involvement of the Ministry of Electronics & IT highlights the government's focus on using technology to improve governance.


**5. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2020 amendments, consider the following statements:**

1.  NGOs are permitted to utilize up to 50% of foreign funds received for administrative expenses under the amended FCRA.
2.  The amended FCRA mandates that all foreign funds received by NGOs must be deposited in a designated FCRA account in any branch of a Scheduled Commercial Bank.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2020 amendments to the FCRA reduced the permissible limit for administrative expenses from 50% to 20% of the total foreign funds received. This stricter regulation aims to ensure that the majority of foreign funds are utilized for the intended purposes of the NGO, thereby enhancing transparency and accountability. The reduction reflects a heightened focus on preventing misuse of foreign funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The amended FCRA mandates that all foreign funds must be deposited in a designated FCRA account, but it *specifically* designates branches of the State Bank of India (SBI), New Delhi, for this purpose,  not any Scheduled Commercial Bank. This centralized approach facilitates better monitoring and oversight of foreign funds received by NGOs. The restriction to SBI branches further strengthens regulatory control over foreign contributions.


**6. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional, citing violations of fundamental rights.
2.  The Aadhaar Act mandates the use of Aadhaar for opening bank accounts and obtaining mobile connections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment in *Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India* did *not* declare the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional. Instead, it upheld the constitutionality of the Act while emphasizing the importance of protecting privacy rights. The court laid down guidelines for the use of Aadhaar data, clarifying its scope and limitations.  The judgement highlighted the importance of balancing national security and individual rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Supreme Court's judgment clarified that while Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing certain government welfare schemes, it cannot be made compulsory for opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  This ruling protects individual choice and prevents the coercive use of Aadhaar for non-welfare purposes. The ruling reflects the court's commitment to protecting individual freedoms while acknowledging the benefits of Aadhaar for targeted welfare programs.


**7. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes funded entirely by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed in the State List of the Constitution.
2. The current framework of CSSs is based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The joint funding reflects the cooperative federalism approach, where both levels of government share responsibility for implementing developmental schemes.  The schemes are implemented by the state governments, but the financial burden is shared.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework governing CSSs is indeed based on the recommendations of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers constituted to rationalize and improve the effectiveness of CSSs in 2015.  This highlights the ongoing efforts to streamline intergovernmental financial cooperation and improve the impact of centrally sponsored programs.  The 2015 report aimed to improve efficiency and reduce duplication in the CSS system.


**8. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule provides for the establishment of autonomous District Councils in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura only.
2. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule of the Constitution establishes autonomous District Councils in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, and Mizoram, not just Assam, Meghalaya, and Tripura.  The inclusion of Mizoram highlights the geographical scope of the provisions aimed at empowering tribal communities in these regions.  The specific inclusion of these states reflects the unique challenges and needs of their respective tribal populations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the *Bardoloi* Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The Bardoloi Committee played a key role in shaping the provisions aimed at safeguarding the interests of tribal communities. The difference between these two committees underscores the importance of understanding the historical context of the Sixth Schedule's creation.



**1. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used to determine the grants allocated to SCS states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* contain any provision for the categorization of any state as an SCS state.  The granting of SCS has been a policy decision based on various factors like geographical disadvantages, socio-economic backwardness, and strategic importance, primarily guided by the recommendations of Finance Commissions.  The lack of constitutional backing makes the SCS designation flexible and subject to political considerations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed the historical basis for calculating grants given to states with SCS. This formula considered several factors to allocate funds, although it has since been superseded by newer allocation methods based on the recommendations of subsequent Finance Commissions.  The formula's replacement highlights the evolving nature of fiscal federalism and resource allocation in India.  The shift away from the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula underscores the dynamic nature of central-state financial relations.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional and historical aspects of SCS in India.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the constitutional framework and the historical evolution of financial relations between the Centre and states.


**2. With reference to Special Packages for States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Special Packages are primarily allocated based on a demonstrable need assessed through a rigorous objective methodology.
2.  The constitutional provision for Special Packages is enshrined under Article 282, which deals with miscellaneous financial provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Special Packages are not allocated based on a rigid, objective needs assessment. While need may play a role in the decision-making process, the allocation is ultimately discretionary, influenced by political and strategic considerations.  The lack of a standardized, transparent allocation process makes these packages susceptible to political bargaining and potentially uneven distribution.

Statement 2 is correct.  Special Packages are indeed provided under Article 282 of the Constitution, which grants the Centre and states the power to make grants for any public purpose, regardless of their legislative competence. This article allows for flexibility in addressing unique state-specific needs that fall outside the usual fiscal arrangements.  The discretionary nature of Article 282 underscores the inherent flexibility in India's fiscal federalism.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the nature and constitutional basis of Special Packages.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the discretionary powers of the central government in fiscal matters and the constitutional provisions enabling such flexibility.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) only in the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.
2.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess limited executive and legislative powers, primarily focused on local administration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), specifically applies to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, granting the Governor the power to establish ADCs and ARCs within these states' designated tribal areas.  This targeted application reflects a recognition of the unique needs and administrative challenges in these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  ADCs and ARCs under the Sixth Schedule possess *extensive* powers, encompassing executive, legislative, and even judicial functions within their specified areas.  They have significant autonomy in areas like land management, revenue collection, and local governance, reflecting a recognition of the need for self-governance within tribal communities.  The extent of their powers contrasts sharply with the limited authority typical of other local bodies.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they misrepresent the scope of the Sixth Schedule and the powers of ADCs and ARCs. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the unique constitutional arrangements for tribal governance in certain states.


**4. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Vertical devolution refers to the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States based on the recommendations of the Finance Commission.  The share allocated to states from the divisible pool currently stands at 51%.
2.  Horizontal devolution involves the distribution of tax revenues among the states based on criteria such as population, area, and income distance, as determined by the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While vertical devolution *does* involve the distribution of tax revenues between the Union and States based on Finance Commission recommendations, the current share allocated to states from the divisible pool is 41%, not 51%. This precise figure is crucial for understanding the distribution of resources in the federal system.

Statement 2 is correct.  Horizontal devolution accurately describes the distribution of funds *among* the states after the divisible pool has been allocated. The Finance Commission uses several criteria, including those mentioned, to ensure a fairer distribution among the states.  Understanding the difference between vertical and horizontal devolution is essential for analyzing India's fiscal federalism.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the current share of states from the divisible pool and the nature of horizontal devolution. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key concepts of fiscal federalism and the role of the Finance Commission in resource allocation.



**5. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to form new states or alter the boundaries of existing states rests solely with the President of India.
2.  Any bill concerning the formation of new states or alteration of state boundaries requires the recommendation of the President before introduction in Parliament.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the President plays a crucial role, the power to form new states or alter state boundaries primarily rests with the Parliament, as per Article 3 of the Constitution. The President's role is significant, but they do not hold sole authority in this matter.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that any bill concerning the formation of new states or boundary changes must be introduced in Parliament only with the President's prior recommendation. This highlights the executive's role in initiating such significant constitutional changes.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the constitutional provisions regarding the formation and alteration of states. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the constitutional process and the respective roles of Parliament and the President in this process.


**6. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of the 15th Finance Commission.
2.  All financial transfers to states under CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The current framework for CSSs is primarily based on the report of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015), not the 15th Finance Commission.  While Finance Commissions influence fiscal policy, the specific structure and guidelines for CSSs are not solely determined by their recommendations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. All financial transfers to states under CSSs are routed through the *Consolidated Fund of the State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India.  This is a crucial distinction that highlights the financial autonomy of states within the federal structure.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent both the basis of the current CSS framework and the routing of funds.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the administrative and financial aspects of CSSs.


**7. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on training and capacity building for all officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is the shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is much broader than just IAS officers. It encompasses *all* civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries and departments of the Union Government.  This comprehensive approach aims to improve the overall effectiveness of the civil service.

Statement 2 is correct.  A fundamental principle of Mission Karmayogi is the transition from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building. This shift emphasizes competency and adaptability, making civil servants better equipped to handle the evolving demands of governance.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope and principles of Mission Karmayogi.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the key goals and features of this significant government initiative.


**8. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996.
2. Gram Nyayalayas have jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters, but their decisions are not binding and can be easily overturned.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, not the Panchayat Raj Act, 1996. This difference in the legislation establishing these courts is crucial for understanding their legal basis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Gram Nyayalayas handle both civil and criminal matters, their decisions are *binding* and are subject to appeals in higher courts as per established legal processes.  The ease with which their decisions can be overturned is not a defining characteristic.  The appeal process is a standard part of the judicial system.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the legislation establishing Gram Nyayalayas and the binding nature of their judgments. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the legal framework governing village-level courts.


**9. With reference to Contempt of Court in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The power to punish for contempt of court is granted to the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 130 and 216 of the Constitution, respectively.
2.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of the court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The power to punish for contempt of court is granted to the Supreme Court and High Courts under Articles 129 and 215 respectively, not Articles 130 and 216.  These articles deal with different aspects of the judiciary.  Knowing the correct articles is vital for understanding the constitutional basis of contempt powers.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of civil and criminal contempt is accurate. Civil contempt focuses on the disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or obstruct justice.  Understanding the distinction between these two types of contempt is key to comprehending the legal implications.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the incorrect citation of constitutional articles and the accurate description of the types of contempt. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions and the legal definitions related to contempt of court.


**10. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are primarily administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. The Station Commander of a cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, they are under the administrative control of the **Ministry of Defence**, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This distinction is important because it reflects the military nature of cantonments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment is indeed the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.  This highlights the military's significant role in the administration of these areas.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misidentification of the administrative ministry overseeing cantonments.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the administrative structure and governance of cantonments.


**11. With reference to the Constitutionalization of Environmental Issues in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court has held that the right to a healthy environment is not explicitly covered under any fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution.
2. The Supreme Court has interpreted Articles 14 and 21 to include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the right to a healthy environment isn't explicitly stated, the Supreme Court has, through judicial interpretation, linked it to existing fundamental rights, particularly the right to life (Article 21) and the right to equality (Article 14).

Statement 2 is correct.  The Supreme Court has indeed interpreted Articles 14 and 21 to encompass the right to be free from the adverse impacts of climate change, expanding the scope of these fundamental rights to include environmental concerns. This judicial activism demonstrates the court's role in evolving constitutional interpretation.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the Supreme Court's stance on the constitutionalization of environmental rights.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of judicial activism and the evolving interpretation of fundamental rights in the context of environmental protection.


**12. With reference to Passports in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The issuance of passports in India is exclusively the responsibility of the Ministry of External Affairs.
2.  Only citizens of India are eligible to apply for Indian passports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of External Affairs plays a central role, the issuance of passports involves various agencies and processes.  The statement oversimplifies the administrative complexity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While most passport holders are Indian citizens, the central government *can* issue passports to non-citizens in certain circumstances, for example, for reasons of public interest. This exception demonstrates the government's flexibility in exceptional cases.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the administrative process and eligibility criteria for Indian passports.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the complexities involved in passport issuance and the exceptions to the general rules.


**13. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs were established as part of the National e-Governance Plan (NeGP) and primarily focus on providing services to urban populations.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a public sector undertaking established under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSCs are indeed part of the NeGP, but they primarily focus on providing services to *rural* populations, bridging the digital divide.  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries.

Statement 2 is correct. The CSC SPV is indeed a company set up under the Indian Companies Act, 1956, although it works closely with various government bodies.  This clarifies its legal and administrative structure.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of the target beneficiaries of CSCs.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the role and objectives of CSCs in India's digital governance strategy.


**14. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The WPFI is an annual ranking of countries based on press freedom, published by the United Nations.
2.  India's ranking in the WPFI has consistently improved over the past decade.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI is published by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a non-governmental organization, not the United Nations.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the source and potential biases of the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's ranking in the WPFI has not consistently improved.  Its position has fluctuated, reflecting concerns about press freedom in the country.  The statement presents an overly optimistic and inaccurate assessment.

Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they misrepresent the publisher of the WPFI and the trend in India's ranking. The question tests the candidate's awareness of international indices related to press freedom and India's performance in this area.


**15. With reference to Mercy Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President of India's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., extends only to cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2.  A mercy petition is a legal recourse available to a convict after all other appeals have been exhausted.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the President's power under Article 72 does include cases involving court-martial sentences, it extends to a broader range of cases, including those where the sentence is imposed by a civil court for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, and most importantly, sentences of death.  The statement severely limits the scope of the President's power.

Statement 2 is correct. A mercy petition is indeed a legal recourse available to convicts after they've exhausted all other legal remedies. This is a crucial aspect of the judicial process and the President's role in clemency.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the limited scope given to the President's power in the first statement.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the constitutional provisions regarding presidential clemency and the role of mercy petitions in the legal system.


**16. With reference to Curative Petitions in India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court can dismiss a curative petition if it finds that the petitioner has not established any violation of principles of natural justice.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after their review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court. This establishes the hierarchical structure of legal remedies.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court has the power to dismiss a curative petition if it finds that the petitioner has not demonstrated a violation of principles of natural justice or any other grounds for which the petition is filed. This underscores the Court's discretionary power in this exceptional circumstance.

Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the hierarchy of legal remedies in the Indian Supreme Court and the grounds for filing a curative petition.


**17. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established primarily to expedite cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2. The FTSCs are funded entirely by state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  FTSCs were established to expedite cases related to rape and those under the POCSO Act.  This highlights the government's focus on addressing these specific crimes effectively and swiftly.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs are funded under a centrally sponsored scheme, primarily from the Nirbhaya Fund.  The funding source is crucial for understanding the financial mechanism behind the initiative.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the funding source for FTSCs.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the objectives and funding mechanisms of FTSCs.


**18. With reference to Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. Jan Yojana Abhiyan is a centrally sponsored scheme aimed at promoting digital literacy among rural women.
2. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan involves the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) through participatory processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Jan Yojana Abhiyan aims at inclusive participation, it is not specifically focused on digital literacy among rural women.  The statement misrepresents its primary objective.

Statement 2 is correct. Jan Yojana Abhiyan, also known as the People's Plan Campaign, is indeed focused on preparing PDPs through participatory methods, involving elected representatives, frontline workers, and community organizations.  This participatory aspect is key to its success.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of the scheme's primary objective. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the goals and methods of Jan Yojana Abhiyan.


**19. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is an initiative of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).
2. iCAL aims to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While iCAL works with the CAG, it is not directly an initiative of the CAG.  The statement oversimplifies the organizational structure and partnerships involved.

Statement 2 is correct. iCAL's primary aim is to set global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies. This reflects the importance of accountability and transparency in local governance.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of iCAL's origin and organizational structure. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the role and objectives of iCAL in promoting good governance.



**1. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework of CSSs is based on a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers focusing on the rationalization of CSSs and aims to streamline the funding process for schemes aligning with the National Development Agenda.
2.  Funding for CSSs is exclusively routed through the Consolidated Fund of India, ensuring centralized control over resource allocation and minimizing inter-state disparities in project implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the 2015 report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs.  This report aimed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of these schemes by streamlining processes and aligning them with the National Development Agenda. The focus is on collaborative efforts between the Centre and States to achieve national goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While all transfers *to* States for CSSs are routed through the Consolidated Fund of the *State*, not the Consolidated Fund of India, this ensures that states maintain control over the disbursement and utilization of funds within their respective jurisdictions.  The Centre's role is primarily in providing the funding, not directly managing its expenditure at the state level. The Consolidated Fund of India manages the central government's finances, while the Consolidated Fund of each state manages that state's finances.  This distinction is crucial for understanding India's fiscal federalism.


**2. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched in 2020, Mission Karmayogi's primary objective is to enhance the administrative efficiency of the Indian Civil Services through a comprehensive capacity-building program focused on skill development and technological advancement in governance.
2.  Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on training and development of senior-level bureaucrats within the Union Government, neglecting the capacity building needs of junior-level officials and employees in other sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Mission Karmayogi, launched as part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), aims to create a more professional, skilled, and future-ready civil service.  The program emphasizes a shift from rule-based to role-based training and a competency-driven approach to capacity development. While technological advancement is a supporting element, the core focus is on enhancing skills and understanding of India's developmental aspirations. The launch year mentioned is slightly off; it was launched in 2021, not 2020.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is broad, encompassing all civil servants, including contractual employees, across various ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies of the Union Government.  It does not limit itself to senior-level bureaucrats.


**3. With reference to the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations on horizontal devolution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission allocated 41% of the divisible pool of taxes to the states, prioritizing states with higher per capita income to address regional disparities and promote balanced development across India.
2.  Horizontal devolution criteria, as recommended by the 15th Finance Commission, included Income Distance, Area, Population (2011 Census), Demographic Performance, Forest and Ecology, and Tax and Fiscal Efforts, with varying weights assigned to each factor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 15th Finance Commission did allocate 41% of the divisible pool to states, it did *not* prioritize states with higher per capita income.  The allocation was based on a formula that considered various factors to address regional disparities, but higher income was not a primary criterion. The commission aimed for a more balanced distribution.

Statement 2 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed used the criteria mentioned: Income Distance, Area, Population (2011 Census), Demographic Performance, Forest and Ecology, and Tax and Fiscal Efforts, each with a specific weight in the formula to determine the horizontal devolution of funds among the states.


**4. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional framework explicitly defines the criteria for granting Special Category Status to states, ensuring transparency and objectivity in the process of identifying states requiring special assistance.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the concept of Special Category Status was abolished, and states previously holding this status now receive funding based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain provisions explicitly defining criteria for granting Special Category Status.  The granting of SCS has historically been a discretionary decision based on a variety of factors, including geographical and socio-economic disadvantages.  This lack of clear criteria has led to debates and controversies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission recommended the phasing out of SCS, and subsequent funding for states formerly categorized as SCS is now based on other criteria and recommendations, such as those of the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers, reflecting a shift in the approach to providing special financial assistance.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, stemming from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, establishes Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs) with extensive executive, legislative, and judicial powers, enabling them to govern tribal areas independently of state governments.
2.  The Sixth Schedule applies to all states with significant tribal populations, ensuring uniform application of its provisions across diverse regions and facilitating equitable development of tribal communities throughout India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Sixth Schedule, based on the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations, does establish ADCs and ARCs in specific states. These councils possess significant autonomy in areas such as lawmaking on matters relevant to tribal life, and they have considerable administrative and financial powers.  However, the description of their powers as "extensive executive, legislative, and judicial powers" needs nuance; their powers are significant but are not entirely independent of the state government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's applicability is *not* universal to all states with significant tribal populations. It is specifically limited to the states of Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Other states with large tribal populations fall under the Fifth Schedule, which has different provisions. This difference in constitutional provisions reflects the unique historical and administrative contexts of the regions.


**6. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India's mandate for auditing local bodies stems from the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996, ensuring uniformity and transparency in financial accountability at the grassroots level.
2.  The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online auditing of panchayat accounts, enhancing efficiency and transparency while reducing reliance on traditional, paper-based auditing processes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG's mandate for auditing local bodies does *not* stem from the Panchayats (Extension to the Scheduled Areas) Act, 1996.  It originates from the CAG (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, which gives the CAG authority over the audit of all government accounts, including those of local bodies.  The PESA Act deals with extending Panchayati Raj institutions to scheduled areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application was indeed developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj to streamline the auditing of panchayat accounts, moving towards a more efficient and transparent system and reducing the reliance on traditional methods.  It has also received international recognition.


**7. With reference to the  formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The process of forming a new state or altering the boundaries of existing states necessitates a constitutional amendment, requiring a two-thirds majority in both houses of Parliament and the assent of the President.
2.  The President of India has the sole authority to initiate the process of state formation or boundary alteration, ensuring that such actions are in accordance with the principles of national unity and integrity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Article 3 of the Constitution outlines the procedure for the formation of new states or the alteration of boundaries. It requires a law passed by Parliament, which necessitates a majority in both houses. The President's assent is also required to make the law effective.  It does *not* require a constitutional amendment; it is done through ordinary legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The President does *not* have the sole authority to initiate the process.  While the President's assent is needed for the finalization of a new state's creation or boundary changes, the process begins with a proposal, usually from a state legislature or the central government, which is then considered by Parliament.  The President's role is a crucial final step, but not the initiating one. The President acts on the advice of the council of ministers.


**8. With reference to  Article 282 of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 282 empowers only the Union Government to make grants for any public purpose, even if it falls outside the legislative competence of the Union, enabling flexibility in addressing unforeseen circumstances and national emergencies.
2.  Grants made under Article 282 are subject to strict parliamentary oversight and accountability mechanisms, ensuring that such grants are utilized efficiently and transparently in accordance with established procedures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 282 empowers *both* the Union and the State Governments to make grants for any public purpose, even if it is beyond their legislative competence.  This provision provides flexibility in addressing various needs and situations that may not fall neatly within the defined legislative powers.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While grants under Article 282 are subject to scrutiny, the level of parliamentary oversight and accountability mechanisms is not necessarily "strict."  The level of scrutiny can vary depending on the nature of the grant and the context in which it is provided.  There is no rigid, universally applied mechanism.  There is a possibility of misuse.


**9. With reference to the  Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPBI is empowered to impose penalties for violations of data protection laws, but its decisions are subject to appeal in the Supreme Court of India, ensuring judicial oversight and due process.
2.  Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected individuals in the event of a data breach, highlighting the importance of transparency and accountability in data handling practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the DPBI *can* impose penalties, appeals against its decisions are made to the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court of India.  This reflects the specialized nature of the DPBI's functions within the telecommunications sector.

Statement 2 is correct.  Data fiduciaries have a clear obligation to promptly inform both the DPBI and the affected individuals in the event of a data breach. This transparency requirement is essential for ensuring accountability and allowing individuals to take appropriate action to mitigate potential harm.


**10. With reference to the  Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Supreme Court of India, in its 2018 judgment, declared the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional, citing concerns regarding the right to privacy and potential for misuse of personal data.
2.  The Aadhaar Act mandates Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes, but it does not mandate Aadhaar for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment did *not* declare the Aadhaar Act unconstitutional.  While it raised concerns about privacy, it upheld the constitutionality of the Act, but with certain safeguards and limitations on data usage.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court judgment clarified that while Aadhaar may be mandatory for accessing certain social welfare schemes, it cannot be made compulsory for opening bank accounts or for accessing mobile and internet services.  This ruling aimed to balance the benefits of Aadhaar with the protection of individual rights.


**1. With reference to the Presidential Address to Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  The President is constitutionally mandated to address both Houses of Parliament at the commencement of every session.
2.  The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, altered the provision requiring the President to address both Houses at the beginning of each year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Originally, Article 87(1) did require the President to address both Houses at the commencement of *every* session. However, this was subsequently amended.  The current practice involves addressing a joint sitting of both Houses, but not necessarily at the start of every session. The frequency is more nuanced than the statement suggests.

Statement 2 is correct. The Constitution (First Amendment) Act, 1951, did indeed amend Article 87(1), modifying the requirement for the President's address. While the President still addresses Parliament, the amendment clarified and adjusted the circumstances under which this address is delivered, making the initial statement an oversimplification. The amendment aimed to streamline the process and provide greater flexibility.  The precise changes involved are complex but the core idea of the amendment altering the original provision is accurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the constitutional evolution regarding the Presidential address.


**2. With reference to the Oaths of Members of Parliament, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 99 stipulates that oaths of office for MPs must be subscribed before the Vice President.
2.  Article 104 mandates that a penalty is imposed on any member who participates in parliamentary proceedings without taking the oath, with no exceptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 99 states that the oaths of office for MPs are to be subscribed before the President or someone appointed by the President, not the Vice President.  This is a crucial detail demonstrating a precise understanding of the constitutional process. The President's role highlights the significance of the oath-taking ceremony within the broader framework of the executive branch.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 104 does prescribe a penalty for sitting in the House without taking the oath. However, it includes an important exception: an individual appointed as a minister can participate in proceedings (though without voting rights) even before taking the oath.  This exception is crucial and highlights the complexities of parliamentary procedure and the potential for temporary exceptions to general rules.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies.


**3. With reference to the Citizenship Act of 1955, consider the following statements:**

1. The Citizenship Act of 1955 explicitly allows for dual citizenship.
2. Section 6A, added through the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, was a direct consequence of the Assam Accord.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship Act of 1955 does *not* provide for dual citizenship.  This is a key aspect of Indian citizenship law, differentiating it from the practices of many other nations. The absence of dual citizenship reflects a specific policy choice aimed at maintaining a clear definition of national belonging.

Statement 2 is correct. Section 6A, a special provision within the Citizenship Act, was indeed added via the Citizenship Amendment Act, 1985, as a direct outcome of the Assam Accord.  This link between a specific legal provision and a historical political agreement is important for understanding the evolution of citizenship law and its relationship to regional conflicts.  The Assam Accord's impact on citizenship demonstrates the interplay between political settlements and legal frameworks.


**4. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonments are administered solely under the purview of state governments.
2.  The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of cantonments, irrespective of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The administration of cantonments falls under the Union Government (Entry 3 of the Union List), not solely under state governments. This reflects the unique nature of cantonments as areas with a significant military presence, requiring centralized control for national security reasons.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing cantonments, it operates *in accordance with* the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies. The 74th Amendment's principles and provisions provide a framework within which the Cantonments Act functions.  Therefore, both statements misrepresent the administrative and legal framework governing cantonments.


**5. With reference to the Supreme Court's interpretation of fundamental rights concerning environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has explicitly recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a fundamental right under Article 21 only.
2.  The recent judgment regarding the protection of the Great Indian Bustard involved the interpretation of Articles 14 and 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has increasingly linked environmental concerns to fundamental rights,  specifically mentioning the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as being covered under Article 21, it has also invoked Article 14 (right to equality).  The Court's approach is not limited to a single article but encompasses multiple provisions to ensure comprehensive protection.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's judgment concerning the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat explicitly involved the interpretation of both Articles 14 (right to equality) and 21 (right to life), demonstrating the Court's expansive approach to fundamental rights in the context of environmental protection. The case highlights the evolving judicial interpretation of fundamental rights to encompass environmental concerns.


**6. With reference to the Doctrine of Harmonious Construction, consider the following statements:**

1. The doctrine of harmonious construction necessitates discarding one law entirely if a conflict arises between two laws.
2. The roots of this doctrine can be traced back to the first amendment made in the judgment of *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India*.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The doctrine of harmonious construction aims to interpret conflicting laws in a way that preserves the essence and spirit of *both*, not to discard one entirely. This approach emphasizes the importance of maintaining consistency and coherence within the legal system.  The goal is reconciliation, not elimination.

Statement 2 is correct.  The origins of the doctrine of harmonious construction are indeed linked to the first amendment made in the *Shankari Prasad v. Union of India* judgment. This landmark case significantly influenced the development of the doctrine and its application in resolving legal conflicts. The case's impact on legal interpretation is widely recognized.


**7. With reference to the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. It introduces the offence of sedition, with stricter penalties than the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
2. It replaces the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, and introduces community service as a potential punishment for petty offences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, *removes* the offence of sedition from the IPC, 1860, not introducing it with stricter penalties.  This represents a significant legal reform, reflecting a change in approach towards freedom of speech and expression.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, does indeed replace the IPC, 1860, and introduces community service as a form of punishment for certain offences, reflecting a shift towards restorative justice practices in some areas.  The introduction of community service showcases a move towards alternative sentencing mechanisms.


**8. With reference to the Uniform Civil Code (UCC), consider the following statements:**

1. Article 44 of the Indian Constitution mandates the immediate implementation of a Uniform Civil Code.
2.  Goa currently operates under a Uniform Civil Code based on the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 44 of the Indian Constitution directs the state to *endeavour* to secure for the citizens a Uniform Civil Code, implying a goal to be pursued rather than an immediate mandate.  The "endeavour" clause signifies a long-term objective, not an immediate requirement.

Statement 2 is correct. Goa does indeed have a form of common civil code in practice, drawing upon the Portuguese Civil Code of 1867. This unique situation in Goa provides a case study for understanding the potential challenges and opportunities associated with a UCC. Goa's experience serves as a valuable point of comparison for broader discussions about the UCC.


**9. With reference to the Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for changes in the religious character of places of worship as determined by the current majority community.
2. The Act freezes the religious character of places of worship as it existed on August 15, 1947.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Places of Worship (Special Provisions) Act, 1991, explicitly aims to maintain the status quo, preventing changes in the religious character of places of worship as it stood on August 15, 1947.  The Act's purpose is to preserve the existing religious identity of places of worship.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act's core provision is to maintain the religious character of places of worship as it was on August 15, 1947, establishing a specific historical benchmark for determining religious identity. This reflects a policy choice to prevent disputes and maintain religious harmony.


**10. With reference to Zero FIRs, consider the following statements:**

1. A Zero FIR is registered only at the police station where the crime occurred.
2.  The provision for Zero FIRs is explicitly mentioned under Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A Zero FIR is registered irrespective of the location of the crime.  The key feature of a Zero FIR is its ability to accept complaints regardless of jurisdiction, ensuring that victims can register their complaints without delay.

Statement 2 is correct. The provision for Zero FIRs is indeed mentioned under Section 531(1) of the Bharatiya Nagrik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, based on recommendations from the Justice Verma Committee.  This demonstrates the legal basis for Zero FIRs and their connection to broader criminal justice reforms.  The mention of the specific section number highlights a precise legal detail.


**11. With reference to the Doctrine of Coverture, consider the following statements:**

1. The Doctrine of Coverture is a modern legal principle used in Indian courts to determine marital property rights.
2.  The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) linked the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) to the Doctrine of Coverture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Doctrine of Coverture is an *outdated* legal principle originating from English common law, not a modern principle used in contemporary Indian courts for determining marital property rights.  Its historical context is crucial for understanding its significance in legal history.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's decision in *Joseph Shine v. Union of India* (2018) did indeed highlight the historical link between the Marital Rape Exception (MRE) and the Doctrine of Coverture, emphasizing the archaic nature of the MRE. The case demonstrates the Court's engagement with historical legal principles in contemporary legal debates.


**12. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are exclusively funded by State governments.
2.  The primary objective of FTSCs is the expeditious disposal of rape cases and those under the POCSO Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.  This funding mechanism highlights the national priority given to addressing crimes against women and children.

Statement 2 is correct. The primary objective of FTSCs is indeed the swift disposal of rape cases and cases falling under the POCSO Act.  This focus reflects a commitment to providing timely justice to victims of these heinous crimes.  The efficiency of FTSCs is a key aspect of their design and implementation.


**13.  With reference to the President's power regarding mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only in cases involving offences against Union laws.
2. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., extends to cases where the sentence is by a court-martial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, etc., in a wider range of cases, including those involving offences against both Union and State laws. The scope of the President's pardon power is broader than stated in the first statement.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 specifically includes cases where the sentence is by a court-martial within the President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences.  This demonstrates the President's role in military justice.


**14. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is the first remedy available to a person whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.
2. The basis for the Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction lies in Article 142 (power to do complete justice).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the *last* resort, not the first, available to a person after their review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.  This highlights the exceptional nature of curative petitions and their role as a final avenue for legal redress.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court's power to entertain curative petitions does indeed stem from Article 142, which grants the Court the power to do complete justice. This constitutional provision underpins the Court's extraordinary jurisdiction.


**15. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to create only Autonomous District Councils (ADCs).
2.  ADCs and ARCs have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management, agriculture, and social customs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule empowers the Governor to create both Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).  The existence of both types of councils is a key feature of the Sixth Schedule's framework.

Statement 2 is correct. ADCs and ARCs do have the power to make laws on subjects like forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, and social customs, reflecting their significant autonomy in administering their respective regions.  The extent of their legislative powers is a key characteristic of the Sixth Schedule.


**16. With reference to the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The formation of a new state requires a resolution passed by the State Legislative Assembly concerned.
2.  A bill for the formation of a new state can be introduced in Parliament only on the President's recommendation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The process is primarily governed by Parliament, based on the President's recommendation.  The role of the State Legislature is not directly involved in initiating the process.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly states that a bill for the formation of a new state or alteration of existing states' boundaries can be introduced in Parliament only with the President's recommendation. This requirement underscores the President's role in the process.


**17. With reference to the State Election Commission (SEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of 1992 did not provide for the constitution of SECs.
2.  The SEC's functions include deciding disputes related to local body elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 73rd and 74th Amendment Acts of 1992 *did* indeed provide for the constitution of State Election Commissions.  This provision is fundamental to ensuring free and fair elections at the local level.

Statement 2 is correct. The SEC's functions include deciding disputes related to local body elections, including matters of candidate disqualification.  This is a crucial aspect of the SEC's role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While traditionally considered final and unchallengeable, the Supreme Court's decision in *Kishorchandra Chhanganlal Rathod* case (2024) asserted that constitutional courts do have the power to review Delimitation Commission orders if they are manifestly arbitrary.  This represents a significant development in the understanding of the Commission's authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Delimitation Commission is a *statutory*, not a constitutional, body.  Its creation is authorized by Parliament under Article 82, but it is not a body directly established by the Constitution itself.  This distinction is important in understanding its legal status.


**19. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution explicitly categorizes certain states as Special Category States.
2.  Special Category State status automatically entitles states to a specific funding pattern determined by the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain any provision for explicitly categorizing states as Special Category States.  The designation was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SCS used to receive grants based on the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula, the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS status.  The current funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on different criteria, not solely on the previous SCS status and associated formulas.  The evolution of funding mechanisms highlights the dynamic nature of governmental policies.


**20. With reference to Special Packages for states, consider the following statements:**

1. Special Packages are provided to states based on a pre-defined formula outlined in the Constitution.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Special Packages are not based on a pre-defined constitutional formula.  They are discretionary grants based on the government's assessment of the needs of specific states.  The flexibility in granting special packages reflects the government's ability to respond to unique circumstances.

Statement 2 is correct. Special Packages are indeed granted under Article 282, which allows the Centre to make grants for public purposes, even those outside its normal legislative competence.  This highlights the flexibility and discretionary nature of such grants.  The mention of Article 282 provides a precise legal basis.


**21. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**


1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution of India.
2. The NCSC's primary function is to investigate and monitor matters related to the welfare and protection of Scheduled Castes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NCSC is a crucial body for safeguarding the rights of Scheduled Castes, it is a statutory body established by law, not a constitutional body established under Part IX of the Constitution.  The distinction between statutory and constitutional bodies is significant in understanding their legal basis and powers.

Statement 2 is correct. The NCSC's primary function is to investigate and monitor matters related to the welfare and protection of Scheduled Castes, ensuring that their rights are upheld.  This highlights the Commission's crucial role in promoting social justice.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The CVC's primary function is to advise the government on matters related to corruption prevention and investigation, playing a crucial role in maintaining administrative integrity.  The CVC's advisory role is key to its effectiveness.


**24. With reference to the Law Commission of India, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NITI Aayog replaced the Planning Commission, the Planning Commission was a statutory body, not a constitutional one.  The change from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog reflects a shift in the approach to national development planning.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NITI Aayog does not formulate five-year plans.  Its role is to act as a think tank and provide policy recommendations to the government, focusing on cooperative federalism and a more flexible approach to development planning.  NITI Aayog's functions are more consultative and advisory than prescriptive.


**26. With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), consider the following statements:**

**27. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which provided limited access to information.
2. The RTI Act guarantees the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, expanding access to information and strengthening transparency and accountability in governance.  The shift from the FOI Act to the RTI Act reflects a significant enhancement in citizen rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RTI Act is based on the principles of transparency and accountability, it does not explicitly guarantee the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Constitution.  The Supreme Court has interpreted certain aspects of Article 19 as related to the right to information, but the RTI Act itself is a statutory enactment.  The legal basis for the RTI Act is distinct from constitutional guarantees.


**1. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and broadened the scope of information access for citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, significantly expanding the categories of information accessible to the public and strengthening the mechanisms for its enforcement.  The 2002 Act was considered inadequate in providing effective access to information. The 2005 Act introduced a more robust framework, including the establishment of Central and State Information Commissions with greater powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President appoints the CIC members, the process involves a committee that includes the Prime Minister as chairperson, the Leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, and a Union Cabinet Minister nominated by the Prime Minister.  The appointment isn't solely based on the Prime Minister's recommendation; it requires the consensus and input of other key figures to ensure impartiality and broad representation.  This committee structure is crucial for maintaining the independence and objectivity of the CIC.  The inclusion of the Leader of the Opposition is particularly significant for ensuring a degree of political balance in the selection process.


**2. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

2. Data principals have the right to obtain information about the processing of their data, seek correction and erasure, and have a grievance redressal mechanism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, requires Data Fiduciaries to inform the DPBI and affected persons in the event of *any* data breach, regardless of severity.  The prompt reporting requirement is crucial for minimizing the potential damage and facilitating timely remedial action. The law emphasizes proactive transparency and accountability.  Ignoring minor breaches could lead to larger issues down the line.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act explicitly grants data principals several rights, including the right to access information about how their personal data is being processed, the right to request corrections or erasure of inaccurate or incomplete data, and the right to seek redress for grievances related to data handling.  These rights are fundamental to ensuring individuals maintain control over their personal information and protecting their privacy.  The inclusion of a grievance redressal mechanism is a crucial aspect of the Act's overall design to ensure accountability and effective dispute resolution.


**3. With reference to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAG's office is established under Article 149 of the Indian Constitution, and the CAG holds office for a term of 8 years or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier.
2. The CAG is responsible for auditing the accounts of all government bodies, including those substantially financed by the government, and enjoys the same precedence as a sitting judge of the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the CAG's office is indeed a constitutional body, it's established under Article 148, not Article 149, of the Indian Constitution.  Furthermore, the CAG's term is 6 years, or until the age of 65, whichever is earlier, not 8 years.  The constitutional provisions regarding the CAG clearly outline the tenure and emphasize the importance of independence and impartiality in its functioning.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAG's responsibilities encompass auditing the receipts and expenditure of the central and state governments, as well as those of bodies and authorities substantially financed by the government.  This wide-ranging mandate ensures accountability in public finance.  Crucially, the CAG enjoys the same precedence as a Supreme Court judge, reflecting the high standing and importance of the office. This precedence ensures the CAG's independence and authority in performing its duties.


**4. With reference to the Model Code of Conduct (MCC) during elections, consider the following statements:**

1. The MCC is a statutory provision enshrined in the Representation of the People Act, 1951, and violations are directly punishable under the Act’s penal provisions.
2. The Election Commission of India (ECI) derives its authority to issue the MCC from Article 324 of the Constitution, which grants it superintendence, direction, and control over elections.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MCC is not a statutory provision; it's a set of guidelines issued by the ECI in consultation with political parties to ensure free and fair elections. While violations can have consequences, they are not directly punishable under the RPA, 1951, in the same way that other electoral offences are.  The MCC's non-statutory nature allows for flexibility and adaptation to evolving political contexts.  However, this also means that enforcement relies heavily on the ECI's authority and the political will of the parties involved.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 324 of the Constitution empowers the ECI with the authority to supervise, direct, and control all aspects of elections. This broad mandate allows the ECI to issue the MCC as a means of regulating the conduct of political parties and candidates during the election process.  The constitutional basis of the ECI’s authority ensures the legitimacy of the MCC and its role in maintaining the integrity of the electoral system.  The ECI's independence is paramount in this context.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Constitution, guaranteeing fundamental rights.
2. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister and including the Speaker of the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993 (as amended), not a constitutional body.  While it deals with human rights, which are guaranteed by the Constitution, the commission itself is not created by the Constitution.  The distinction is crucial for understanding its legal basis and powers.  It operates within the framework of the law, but its powers are not directly derived from the Constitution.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints the Chairperson and members of the NHRC based on the recommendations of a committee. This committee is headed by the Prime Minister and includes the Speaker of the Lok Sabha, the Minister in charge of the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Leaders of the Opposition in both houses of Parliament, and the Deputy Chairman of the Rajya Sabha.  This multi-faceted committee structure ensures broad representation and aims to maintain the NHRC's independence and impartiality.  The involvement of representatives from both the ruling and opposition parties is intended to promote consensus and balance.


**6.  With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Part XVI of the Constitution, dealing with the welfare of Scheduled Castes.
2.  The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints of atrocities against Scheduled Castes and recommend appropriate action to the government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NCSC is a statutory body, established under the Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order, 1950, and not a constitutional body enshrined in Part XVI.  While it deals with the welfare and protection of Scheduled Castes, its legal basis is statutory, not constitutional.  The distinction is significant in understanding its powers and limitations compared to constitutional bodies.  Its functions are defined by the law establishing it, which can be amended.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NCSC has the power to investigate complaints of atrocities and discrimination against Scheduled Castes and submit recommendations to the government for appropriate action.  This investigative power is crucial for ensuring the enforcement of laws designed to protect Scheduled Castes and address systemic inequalities.  The NCSC plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of government policies and programs aimed at the welfare of Scheduled Castes.


**7. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is a constitutional body established under Article 315 of the Constitution, responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to various civil services.
2.  The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPSC is indeed a constitutional body, established under Article 315 of the Constitution.  Its primary function is conducting examinations and recommending candidates for various civil services positions within the Union Government.  Its constitutional status ensures its independence and impartiality in the recruitment process.  This independence is crucial for maintaining meritocracy and preventing political interference in the selection of civil servants.

Statement 2 is correct. The President appoints the Chairman and members of the UPSC.  They serve for a term of six years or until they attain the age of 62, whichever is earlier.  This fixed tenure contributes to the UPSC's independence, preventing short-term political influence on its decisions.  The age limit ensures that the commission is composed of individuals with substantial experience and expertise.  The appointment process and tenure are designed to safeguard the UPSC's integrity.


**8. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are established under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are responsible for the administration and governance of cantonment areas.
2.  Cantonment Boards are entirely independent of state governments and function directly under the Ministry of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonment Boards are established under the Cantonments Act, 2006. They are responsible for the civic administration and governance of the cantonment areas, which are typically military installations and surrounding civilian settlements.  Their functions include providing essential services such as sanitation, water supply, and infrastructure maintenance within their jurisdiction.  The Act outlines their powers and responsibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are significantly influenced by the Ministry of Defence, they are not entirely independent of state governments.  There is a degree of overlap and interaction between the boards and the state governments in areas such as law and order, some aspects of revenue collection, and certain regulatory functions.  The precise nature of this interaction can vary depending on the state and the specific cantonment.  The relationship between the boards and state governments is complex and often requires coordination.


**9. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (Indian Evidence Act, 2023), consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that electronic or digital records will be admissible as evidence only if they are authenticated by a government-authorized digital signature.
2. The Act introduces provisions for joint trials, specifically allowing for the trial of multiple accused persons even if some have absconded.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, allows for the admissibility of electronic or digital records as evidence, but it doesn't mandate that they *must* be authenticated solely by a government-authorized digital signature.  While digital signatures can certainly be used for authentication, the Act allows for other methods of authentication as well, depending on the circumstances and the nature of the evidence.  The broader aim is to ensure that electronic evidence is treated similarly to paper-based evidence, acknowledging the increasing prevalence of digital communication and record-keeping.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does introduce provisions for joint trials, specifically stating that the trial of multiple accused persons can proceed even if some have absconded or haven't responded to arrest warrants.  This provision aims to streamline the judicial process and prevent undue delays in cases involving multiple accused.  The ability to conduct joint trials is a significant change aimed at improving efficiency in the judicial system, particularly in cases with multiple suspects.  This can lead to faster resolution of cases and reduce the burden on the courts.


**10. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign), consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan was launched in 2018 to improve the quality of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) by focusing solely on financial resource allocation and budgetary processes.
2.  The campaign emphasizes inclusive participation, including the involvement of youth and elderly citizens in the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to improve the quality of PDPs, but it's not limited to financial resource allocation and budgetary processes.  It focuses on broader participatory planning, ensuring that the plans reflect the needs and priorities of the community.  The campaign emphasizes a holistic approach to development, encompassing social, economic, and environmental aspects.  The focus is on bottom-up planning rather than a top-down approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly promotes inclusive participation, actively encouraging the involvement of youth and elderly citizens in the preparation of GPDPs.  This participatory approach aims to ensure that the plans are truly representative of the community's needs and priorities.  The inclusion of diverse voices and perspectives is a central element of the campaign's strategy.  This approach helps to increase the ownership and effectiveness of the development plans.


**1. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, marking a significant increase from previous allocations.
2.  Horizontal devolution, as determined by the 15th Finance Commission, prioritizes income distance as the most heavily weighted criterion for resource distribution among states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, but this does not represent a significant *increase* compared to previous allocations.  The actual change in percentage allocation varies depending on the comparison and the specific components of the divisible pool considered.  The statement oversimplifies a complex process of fiscal devolution.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 15th Finance Commission did indeed assign the highest weight (45%) to income distance among the criteria used for horizontal devolution of resources among states.  This reflects a policy emphasis on addressing regional disparities in income levels.  Other criteria, such as area, population, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts, received lower weightings.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The constitutional framework explicitly defines the criteria and process for granting Special Category Status to states.
2.  Following the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, the SCS ceased to exist, and no state has been granted this status since.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution of India does *not* contain any explicit provision for categorizing states as "Special Category States."  The SCS was a practice developed over time based on the recommendations of Finance Commissions and other policy considerations. The criteria for granting SCS were not clearly defined in the Constitution itself, leading to debates and inconsistencies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission did recommend the discontinuation of the SCS system.  This recommendation was largely accepted, and consequently, no state has been granted SCS since then.  The rationale behind this was to promote a more uniform and equitable system of resource allocation.  However, special financial packages are still provided to states facing specific challenges.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule mandates the establishment of autonomous district councils in all states with significant tribal populations.
2. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations directly influenced the formulation of the Sixth Schedule, primarily focusing on administrative efficiency in tribal areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does provide for the establishment of autonomous district councils, but it doesn't mandate their creation in *all* states with significant tribal populations.  The application of the Sixth Schedule is limited to specific states in Northeast India, reflecting the unique historical and administrative contexts of those regions.  The criteria for inclusion under the Sixth Schedule are not based solely on the size of a state's tribal population.

Statement 2 is correct. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations significantly shaped the provisions of the Sixth Schedule. While administrative efficiency was a consideration, the committee’s primary focus was on addressing the unique needs and governance structures of tribal communities in specific regions.  The committee aimed to balance the need for integration with the preservation of tribal autonomy.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The current framework of CSSs is entirely based on the recommendations of the 14th Finance Commission, which significantly altered intergovernmental fiscal relations.
2.  The funding pattern for core CSSs in the eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states mandates a 90:10 Centre-State ratio, reflecting the region's developmental needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations did influence the evolution of CSSs (by abolishing the Plan-Non Plan distinction), the current framework is not *entirely* based on its recommendations.  Several other factors and subsequent policy decisions have also shaped the design and implementation of CSSs. The statement oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors influencing the design of CSSs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The funding pattern for core CSSs in the eight Northeastern states and three Himalayan states does indeed typically follow a 90:10 Centre-State ratio.  This reflects a policy aimed at addressing the unique developmental challenges and infrastructural gaps in these regions.  This higher central contribution is intended to support faster development in these areas.


**5. Consider the following statements about the  National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB) – Mission Karmayogi:**

1. Mission Karmayogi exclusively focuses on training and capacity building for  officers of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS).
2. A key principle guiding Mission Karmayogi is a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mission Karmayogi's scope is much broader than just IAS officers. It aims to enhance the capacity of *all* civil servants across various ministries, departments, organizations, and agencies of the Union Government, including contractual employees.  The program seeks to improve the overall effectiveness of the civil service as a whole.

Statement 2 is correct. A core principle of Mission Karmayogi is indeed a shift from a rule-based to a role-based approach to training and capacity building. This means focusing on developing the competencies and skills required for specific roles and responsibilities rather than solely adhering to prescribed rules and regulations.  This approach aims to make training more relevant and effective.


**6. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL's primary objective is to standardize auditing practices for central government ministries and departments.
2.  iCAL serves as a knowledge center and think tank, addressing governance issues at the grassroots level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. iCAL's focus is on auditing *local* governance bodies, not central government ministries and departments.  The center aims to improve the quality and effectiveness of audits at the local level, contributing to better financial management and service delivery in local governments.  Its scope is specifically targeted at sub-national levels of governance.

Statement 2 is correct. iCAL functions as a knowledge center and think tank, providing expertise and support for addressing governance challenges at the grassroots level.  It facilitates collaboration between policymakers and auditors, promoting capacity building and best practices in local governance audits.  This aspect is central to its mission.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the "right to be forgotten" (RTBF) in India:**

1. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, explicitly incorporates the "right to be forgotten" as a fundamental right of data subjects.
2. The Supreme Court of India, in the Justice K.S. Puttaswamy case (2017), recognized the RTBF as an integral part of the right to life under Article 21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, does *not* explicitly mention or codify the "right to be forgotten." While the Act addresses data protection and privacy, the specific concept of the right to be forgotten is not explicitly included in its provisions.  The Act focuses on other aspects of data protection.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court of India, in the Puttaswamy judgment, did indeed recognize the "right to be forgotten" as a facet of the right to life under Article 21.  This recognition was based on the principle of informational self-determination and the individual's right to control the flow of personal information.  However, the Court did not define the exact scope or limitations of this right.


**8. With reference to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ILP system is applicable uniformly across all states in Northeast India, irrespective of their geographical location or historical context.
2.  Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) who have resided abroad for more than six months are not eligible for an ILP and must apply for a Protected/Restricted Area Permit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ILP system is *not* uniformly applicable across all states in Northeast India.  It is implemented in specific states (Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Manipur) based on their unique historical, geographical, and socio-cultural contexts. The application of the ILP is determined by state-specific regulations and historical agreements.

Statement 2 is correct.  NRIs who have resided abroad for more than six months are indeed generally not eligible for an ILP. They would need to apply for a Protected/Restricted Area Permit (PAP/RAP), which has a different application process and may have stricter requirements.  This distinction reflects different levels of access and control over regulated areas.


**9. Consider the following statements about the formation of new states in India:**

1.  The Parliament can create a new state through a constitutional amendment requiring a two-thirds majority in both Houses.
2.  Before recommending a bill that affects the area, boundaries, or name of a state, the President must consult with the legislature of the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Parliament can create a new state through *ordinary* legislation, requiring only a simple majority in both Houses.  A constitutional amendment is not necessary for the formation of new states.  The process is governed by Article 3 of the Constitution, which allows Parliament to create new states or alter boundaries.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 explicitly states that before recommending a bill affecting the area, boundaries, or name of a state, the President must consult with the legislature of the affected state.  This ensures that the affected state has an opportunity to express its views on the proposed changes.  This consultation is a crucial step in the state formation process.


**10. With reference to the Indian Postal Department, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, grants the Department of Posts the exclusive right to issue postage stamps and operate postal services within India.
2. The  Indian Post Office Act, 1898, includes stringent penal provisions for offenses related to the misuse or obstruction of postal services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although the wording needs slight clarification.  The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, grants the Department of Posts a *near* monopoly over postal services. While private entities may offer some competing services, the Department of Posts retains primary control and authority over the issuance of postage stamps and the core functionality of postal services.  The statement is largely true in its intent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, does *not* contain stringent penal provisions.  While the Act provides for penalties for certain offenses, these are not considered particularly stringent in comparison to other legal frameworks.  The Act primarily focuses on regulating postal operations and services, rather than establishing heavy penalties.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to enhance people's participation in preparing Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26, focusing on a thematic approach based on localized Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
2.  A key component of the Abhiyan involves conducting structured Ward Sabhas, Mahila Sabhas, Gram Sabhas, Block Sabhas, and District Sabhas to identify thematic developmental gaps based on the Panchayat Development Index (PDI).  These plans, once approved, are published on the e-Gram Swaraj portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect aspects of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (also known as the People's Plan Campaign).  Statement 1 correctly identifies the Abhiyan's aim to increase public participation in PDP preparation for 2025-26 and its emphasis on a thematic approach aligned with localized SDGs. The "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach" underscores this inclusive strategy. Statement 2 correctly points to the structured meetings at various Panchayat levels as a core mechanism for identifying developmental gaps using the PDI. The publication of approved plans on the e-Gram Swaraj portal is also a factual element of the Abhiyan's implementation.  Therefore, both statements are correct representations of the scheme's goals and methods.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first of its kind in India and aims to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies, focusing primarily on enhancing the independence of local government auditors.
2.  iCAL's mandate includes acting as a knowledge center and think tank, addressing grassroots governance challenges, and improving financial performance assessment and service delivery through capacity building initiatives for auditors.  Its work is directly linked to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are accurate descriptions of iCAL's objectives and functions. Statement 1 correctly highlights iCAL's pioneering status in India and its goal of setting global standards for auditing local governance. The emphasis on auditor independence is a crucial aspect of its mission. Statement 2 accurately describes iCAL's role as a knowledge center and think tank, its focus on capacity building, and its contribution to improved financial performance and service delivery. The connection to the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts, which deal with local self-governance, is also accurate, as iCAL's work directly impacts the implementation and accountability mechanisms established by these amendments.  Therefore, both statements provide a correct and comprehensive overview of iCAL's functions.


**3. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSSs, jointly funded by the central and state governments, are implemented through states in sectors listed in the State and Concurrent Lists of the Constitution, with funding patterns varying depending on whether the state is in the Northeast or a Himalayan state.  The current framework is based on a 2015 report.
2.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction in 2017, CSSs, along with Central Sector schemes, have become the primary mode of specific purpose transfers from the Union to the States.  NITI Aayog plays a crucial role in monitoring and overseeing third-party evaluations of CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs) in India.  Statement 1 correctly describes the joint funding mechanism, the constitutional basis for their implementation, and the varying funding patterns based on geographical location (Northeast and Himalayan states receiving a higher central share). The reference to the 2015 report outlining the current framework is also factual. Statement 2 correctly explains the shift in the primary mode of specific purpose transfers to states after the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations and the abolition of the Plan-Non Plan distinction.  NITI Aayog's role in monitoring and third-party evaluations is also an accurate representation of its current involvement with CSSs.  Therefore, both statements correctly describe important features and recent developments related to CSSs.


**4. With reference to the Aadhaar Act, 2016, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar Act, in its 2018 Supreme Court judgment, was deemed constitutional, but its metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, and it cannot be mandated for opening bank accounts or mobile/internet connections.
2.  Aadhaar is primarily a proof of address and identity for Indian residents;  the Act allows the central and state governments to require Aadhaar for accessing social welfare schemes funded from the Consolidated Fund of India or the Consolidated Fund of the State.  The architecture is designed for scalable technology and electronic benefit transfers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect key aspects of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, and the Supreme Court's ruling on its constitutionality. Statement 1 correctly states that the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act in 2018, while also imposing limitations on metadata retention and prohibiting its mandatory use for services like bank accounts and internet connections.  Statement 2 correctly identifies Aadhaar's primary function as a proof of address and identity, while also noting the government's ability to mandate its use for accessing specific social welfare schemes. The emphasis on scalable technology and electronic benefit transfers is also a factual component of the Aadhaar system's design.  Therefore, both statements provide a correct summary of the Aadhaar Act and its legal context.


**5.  With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mission Karmayogi, part of the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), aims to transform the civil service into a future-ready, professional force capable of implementing India's developmental agenda. It includes all civil servants, including contractual employees.
2.  A key principle of Mission Karmayogi is a shift from rule-based to role-based training and capacity building, emphasizing a competency-driven approach and  a shared understanding of India's developmental priorities among civil servants. The Capacity Building Commission (CBC) plays a central role in its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the goals and principles of Mission Karmayogi. Statement 1 correctly identifies its overarching objective of modernizing and professionalizing the civil service to better meet India's developmental needs. The inclusion of all civil servants, including contractual employees, is also a factual aspect of its scope. Statement 2 accurately reflects the shift from rule-based to role-based training as a core principle, emphasizing a competency-driven approach and fostering a shared understanding of national priorities. The CBC's crucial role in implementation is also correct.  Therefore, both statements offer a correct and detailed description of Mission Karmayogi's aims and methodology.


**6. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1.  Established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, Gram Nyayalayas are mobile courts with jurisdiction over both civil and criminal cases, aiming to resolve petty disputes at the village level.  They are located at intermediate Panchayat headquarters and are deemed courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class.
2.  Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the rules of evidence in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but operate under principles of natural justice.  Appeals from their decisions are handled by the Court of Session (criminal) and the district court (civil), with a six-month timeframe for disposal.  The Act exempts certain states and tribal areas.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the key features and functions of Gram Nyayalayas. Statement 1 correctly describes their establishment under the 2008 Act, their mobile court nature, their jurisdiction (civil and criminal), and their location at intermediate Panchayat headquarters. The designation as courts of Judicial Magistrate of First Class is also accurate. Statement 2 correctly states that Gram Nyayalayas are not bound by the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but adhere to principles of natural justice. The appellate process, timelines, and exemptions for certain states and tribal areas are also accurately described. Therefore, both statements provide a comprehensive and factually correct overview of Gram Nyayalayas.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Protected and Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963:**

1.  Under the 1963 Order, entire Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are designated as Protected Areas, while parts of Himachal Pradesh, Jammu & Kashmir, Rajasthan, and Uttarakhand are also included.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area.
2.  Foreigners, excluding Bhutanese citizens, require special permits to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas unless extraordinary reasons are established to justify the visit.  The Central Government retains the authority to grant exceptions to this rule in the public interest.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While it's true that the Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area,  the statement incorrectly asserts that entire Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are Protected Areas.  Parts of Sikkim are designated as a Restricted Area.   Statement 2 correctly explains the permit requirement for foreigners (excluding Bhutanese citizens) to enter and stay in Protected or Restricted Areas, along with the Central Government's power to grant exceptions in the public interest.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**8. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's fiscal federalism arrangement is defined by the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution, which outlines the tax bases for both the Union and States (Article 246), and includes provisions for revenue distribution between them, such as taxes levied and collected by the Centre but assigned to States (Article 269).
2.

The statement also accurately notes the Supreme Court and High Courts' power to punish for contempt. Statement 2 provides a more detailed description of the specific actions that constitute civil and criminal contempt. The reference to Articles 129 and 215, which grant the Supreme Court and High Courts the power to punish for contempt, is also accurate.  Therefore, both statements provide a complete and correct picture of contempt of court.


**11. With reference to Mercy Petitions and Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences in certain cases, including death sentences, while a curative petition is the last resort available to someone whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, provides the statutory backing for the establishment of Gram Nyayalayas.  These courts are designed to handle petty disputes at the village level, encompassing both civil and criminal matters. However, the Act specifically exempts certain states (Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim) and tribal areas from their jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the State Government appoints the Nyayadhikari in consultation with the High Court, a crucial detail is omitted: Gram Nyayalayas are *not* bound by the strict rules of evidence outlined in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They operate under the principles of natural justice, allowing for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution.  This difference is a key distinction between Gram Nyayalayas and regular courts. The statement incorrectly implies adherence to the formal evidentiary standards of the Indian Evidence Act.

Statement 1 accurately defines the two main types of contempt of court: civil contempt (disobedience of court orders) and criminal contempt (actions that undermine the court's authority).  The distinction between these two types is crucial for understanding the different penalties and procedures involved.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the constitutional basis (Articles 129 and 215) for the Supreme Court and High Courts' power to punish for contempt.  The Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, provides the statutory framework for implementing this power, outlining procedures, defenses, and penalties. The statement correctly points out the sources of power and the relevant legislation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

This reflects a significant development in environmental jurisprudence.

Statement 2 correctly identifies the case ('M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others') which provided the context for this landmark judgment.  The focus on the Great Indian Bustard and its habitat demonstrates how the court is applying this broadened interpretation of fundamental rights to specific environmental protection cases.  The case serves as a precedent for future environmental litigation.


**6. With reference to Bail Provisions in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bhartiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita (BNSS), 2023, introduces a provision that the maximum period for which an undertrial prisoner can be detained is one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment for the offense, with first-time offenders eligible for bail if detained for over one-third of the maximum period.
2. The Supreme Court's ruling in Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India reinforces the principle that 'bail is the rule, jail is the exception,' even in cases involving special statutes like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, emphasizing the importance of upholding Article 21 rights.

This demonstrates a legislative effort to streamline bail procedures and mitigate prolonged pre-trial detention.

Statement 2 correctly summarizes the Supreme Court's significant ruling in Jalaluddin Khan v. Union of India. This ruling underscores the importance of adhering to the principle that bail should be the norm rather than exception, even in cases involving stringent laws like the UAPA, 1967.  The emphasis on Article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) highlights the constitutional dimension of this judicial pronouncement.


**7.  With reference to the provisions of the Citizenship Act, 1955, consider the following statements:**

1.  Acquisition of Indian citizenship through naturalization requires a minimum period of 11 years of residence in India, along with fluency in one of the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While fluency in one of the languages listed in the Eighth Schedule is a requirement for naturalization, the minimum residence period is *not* 11 years. The correct period is different and has been subject to change through amendments.

Statement 2 is correct. The CAA, 2019, provides a specific pathway to citizenship for illegal migrants belonging to six religious communities who have entered India from three designated countries before a specified date, subject to conditions related to exclusion from certain areas.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, is the primary legislation governing domestic arbitration in India.  It has undergone several amendments, most notably incorporating elements of the UNCITRAL Model Law. The retrospective application of the amendment addressing fraud or corruption is also a key feature.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the NDIAC Act, 2019, did establish the NDIAC to facilitate institutional arbitration and aims to raise the standards of arbitration in India, it does *not* exclusively focus on international commercial arbitrations. It handles both domestic and international cases.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the NDIAC's jurisdiction.


**9. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, the entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands and parts of Sikkim are designated as Restricted Areas, requiring foreigners to obtain special permits for entry.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, clearly designates the entire Andaman & Nicobar Islands and *parts* of Sikkim as Restricted Areas. Foreigners require special permits to enter these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area, the statement incorrectly claims that Sikkim is also entirely a Protected Area.  A portion of Sikkim is designated as a Restricted Area, as per the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  The statement incorrectly presents Sikkim's status.


**10. With reference to Fiscal Federalism in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Article 269 of the Indian Constitution deals with taxes levied and collected by the Union but assigned to the States, while Article 269A deals with the levy and collection of Goods and Services Tax (GST) in interstate trade and commerce, distributed between the Centre and States based on GST Council recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the MCC's genesis in 1960 during Kerala's assembly elections is accurate, its focus is broader than just campaign finance and media appearances.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 2 is also correct, accurately identifying the 2015 report as the basis for the current framework and NITI Aayog's expanded role in monitoring and evaluation, including oversight of third-party evaluations.  Therefore, the correct answer is (c).


**7. With reference to Mission Karmayogi, consider the following statements:**

1. Mission Karmayogi, launched under the National Programme for Civil Services Capacity Building (NPCSCB), aims to transform the civil service by shifting from rule-based to role-based training and adopting a competency-driven approach, focusing exclusively on training high-ranking bureaucrats.
2. The Integrated Government Online Training (iGOT)-Karmayogi platform is a comprehensive online portal that guides government officials in their capacity building journey, with performance monitoring of all users based on key performance indicators (KPIs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mission Karmayogi does aim for a shift to role-based training and a competency-driven approach, it's not limited to high-ranking bureaucrats; it covers all civil servants.  Statement 2 is entirely correct.  The iGOT-Karmayogi platform's role as a comprehensive online training portal and its performance monitoring system based on KPIs are accurate.  Therefore, only statement 2 is completely correct, making (b) the right answer.


**8. Consider the following statements about the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1. The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Directorate of Public Grievances in the Cabinet Secretariat are the only two designated nodal agencies in the Union Government handling grievances.
2.  The Grievance Redressal Assessment Index (GRAI), conceptualized by DARPG, provides an organization-wise comparative picture of GRM effectiveness, including timelines for grievance redressal (now reduced to 21 days) and the establishment of dedicated grievance cells in every ministry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances are key agencies, other entities also handle grievances at various levels. Statement 2 is largely correct. The GRAI's function of comparative assessment is accurate, as is its use in evaluating GRM performance across organizations. The mention of reduced timelines and dedicated grievance cells also aligns with recent policy changes.  Therefore, only statement 2 is substantially correct, making (b) the correct option.  Note that while the statement about timelines is accurate, the precise number of days might vary slightly depending on the specific context, making it a plausible distractor.  However, the core idea of timeline reduction is correct.


**9. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, enacted in 2005, provides citizens with the right to access information held by Public Authorities (PAs), with the Department of Personnel and Training (under MoPPG&P) acting as the coordinating agency, and exempting all personal information from disclosure.
2.  The RTI Act's jurisdiction extends to all courts, including lower courts, but appeals against decisions of Public Information Officers (PIOs) can be made only to the appellate authority under the act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act's core function and the coordinating agency are correctly described, the statement wrongly claims that *all* personal information is exempt.  The DPDP Act, 2023, modified this aspect, but not to the extent of complete exemption.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Lower courts are generally barred from entertaining suits or applications under the RTI Act; their jurisdiction is limited.  Appeals are a specified process within the RTI framework.  Therefore, both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.


**10. With reference to the National Commission for Scheduled Castes (NCSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NCSC is a constitutional body established under Article 338 of the Constitution, with its primary function being to investigate and monitor complaints related to atrocities against Scheduled Castes, but having no power to prosecute offenders.
2. The NCSC's powers include summoning witnesses, taking evidence, and conducting inquiries, but it does not have the authority to issue directions to the Central or State governments on matters related to welfare schemes for Scheduled Castes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The NCSC's constitutional basis and its investigative role concerning atrocities against Scheduled Castes are accurate. The statement about the lack of prosecutorial power is also true; the NCSC investigates and makes recommendations, but the prosecution rests with other agencies. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NCSC does have the power to issue directions to the Central and State governments on matters relating to welfare schemes for Scheduled Castes. This is a crucial part of its mandate to ensure the effective implementation of policies for the welfare of Scheduled Castes.  Therefore, only statement 1 is essentially correct, making (a) the correct option.


**1. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI's decisions are subject to appeal before the Supreme Court of India.
2. Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected persons only in case of a major data breach, defined as one affecting more than 10,000 individuals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court's jurisdiction is broader and not specifically designated for appeals against DPBI rulings.  This is a crucial distinction reflecting the specialized nature of data protection disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Data fiduciaries are obligated to inform the DPBI and affected persons in the event of *any* data breach, regardless of the number of individuals affected.  The law does not specify a threshold for reporting breaches; the principle is proactive notification to ensure transparency and allow for timely remedial action.  A lower threshold for reporting could lead to underreporting and hinder effective data protection.


**2. With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act mandates that all spectrum allocation must be done through auctions, with no exceptions.
2. The Act establishes a new fund, Digital Bharat Nidhi, to support the development of telecommunication services and technologies, replacing the Universal Service Obligation Fund.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act prioritizes auctioning for spectrum allocation, it allows for administrative allocation in specified cases, such as national security, disaster management, weather forecasting, transport, and satellite services. This provision acknowledges the critical role of spectrum in essential public services, where auctioning might not be the most efficient or appropriate mechanism.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act replaces the Universal Service Obligation Fund with the Digital Bharat Nidhi, expanding the scope of funding to encompass research and development of telecommunication services, technologies, products, and pilot projects under the control of the central government. This reflects a broader vision for technological advancement and digital infrastructure development.


**3. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar metadata, including biometric data, can be retained indefinitely for national security purposes.
2. The Aadhaar Act, 2016, mandates Aadhaar for accessing all government services, including private sector employment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment on the Aadhaar Act specifies that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months, unless specifically required by law for a limited period.  This restriction safeguards individual privacy while acknowledging legitimate government interests.  Indefinite retention would violate fundamental rights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment clarified that Aadhaar is mandatory for accessing social welfare schemes but cannot be forced for opening bank accounts or for mobile and internet connections.  The ruling emphasizes the voluntary nature of Aadhaar adoption in contexts beyond social welfare benefits, balancing government efficiency with individual autonomy.


**4. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are exclusively funded by the Central Government and implemented by State Governments.
2. The funding pattern for core CSSs is uniformly 60:40 (Centre:State) across all states in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the Centre and States, reflecting a collaborative approach to national development. The implementation is primarily through State Governments, but the central government retains a significant role in monitoring and oversight.  This collaborative model ensures that schemes are aligned with both national priorities and regional needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the typical funding pattern for core CSSs is 60:40 (Centre:State) for most states, exceptions exist for Northeastern and Himalayan states, where the Centre's contribution is 90%.  This differentiated funding acknowledges the unique developmental challenges faced by these regions.  Uniformity in funding would not address these specific needs effectively.


**5. With reference to the Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, and are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. The Station Commander of a Cantonment is the ex-officio President of the Cantonment Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Cantonment Boards are administered under the Cantonments Act, 2006, they are under the administrative control of the Ministry of Defence, not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  This reflects the military nature of cantonments and their strategic importance.  The Ministry of Defence's role ensures effective coordination with the armed forces.

Statement 2 is correct. The Station Commander of a cantonment holds the ex-officio position of President of the Cantonment Board. This arrangement ensures military oversight of the civilian administration within the cantonment, maintaining order and security. The dual role enhances efficiency and coordination within the cantonment's unique context.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for appeals against the decisions of Public Information Officers (PIOs) only to the Central Information Commission (CIC) or State Information Commissions (SICs).
2.  The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, empowered the Central Government to determine the terms and conditions of employment for Information Commissioners (ICs) at both the Central and State levels, including salaries and allowances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act provides a mechanism for citizens to appeal against PIO decisions to the CIC or SICs, depending on whether the PIO is at the Central or State level. This ensures independent oversight and redressal of grievances regarding information requests. This two-tiered appellate system ensures accountability and effective implementation of the Act.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, indeed granted the Central Government the authority to define the terms, salaries, allowances, and other employment conditions for Information Commissioners at both the Central and State levels. This amendment aimed to enhance the independence and effectiveness of the Information Commissions.  This move, however, was met with some criticism regarding the potential impact on the independence of these commissions.


**7. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly mentions the category of "Special Category States" and lays down criteria for their designation.
2.  Following the recommendations of the Fourteenth Finance Commission, the designation of Special Category States was abolished, and no new SCS have been granted since then.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution of India does *not* explicitly define or mention "Special Category States." The designation arose from policy decisions and recommendations of various Finance Commissions. There are no constitutional provisions that define the term or provide criteria for assigning this status, leading to ambiguity and disputes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Fourteenth Finance Commission recommended phasing out the SCS category.  Consequently, no new states have received Special Category State status since its recommendations were accepted. This change aimed to create a more equitable distribution of resources among all states.  However, the special funding patterns for some states continue, based on other recommendations and criteria.


**8. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President can grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment only in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment extends only to offences against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends, not to state laws.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment in cases where the sentence is imposed by a court-martial *and* in cases where the sentence is for an offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or a sentence of death.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power only to court-martial cases.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to cases involving offences against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends *and* to cases where a sentence of death is imposed. The scope of the President's power is not limited only to Union laws; it includes death sentences under state laws as well.  This broad power reflects the President's role as the head of state.


**9. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs were established as a state-sponsored scheme to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.
2. The funding for FTSCs is entirely borne by the respective state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored* scheme, not a state-sponsored one, launched in 2019 to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.  The central government's involvement reflects the national importance of addressing these crimes effectively.  State governments play a role in implementation, but the scheme's funding and overall direction are centrally driven.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The funding for FTSCs is primarily provided by the Central Government from the Nirbhaya Fund, not entirely by the state governments.  The central funding reflects the national commitment to improving the justice system's response to these crimes.  State governments may contribute to some operational costs, but the bulk of funding comes from the Nirbhaya Fund.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's fiscal federalism:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, based on criteria including income distance, area, and population.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution permits state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the Union government's approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 15th Finance Commission indeed recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool of taxes for the states.  This distribution is based on multiple factors, including income distance, area, population (2011 census data), demographic performance, forest cover and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  These criteria aim to balance the needs of different states and promote equitable resource allocation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution explicitly restricts state governments from borrowing money outside India.  They can only borrow within the country.  Furthermore,  if a state is already indebted to the Union government, it requires the Union's prior consent for any further borrowing, even within India.  This provision is designed to maintain fiscal discipline and prevent excessive state debt.  The Union government's oversight is crucial in maintaining macroeconomic stability.


**2. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was used to determine grants to states with Special Category Status, based primarily on their population and area.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the abolishment of the Special Category Status classification, replacing it with a needs-based approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was indeed associated with the allocation of funds to states, it was not the sole basis for determining grants to SCS states.  The formula considered various factors,  but its primary focus was not strictly limited to population and area.  Other factors like backwardness and geographical challenges played a significant role.  The formula was also subject to revisions and modifications over time.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission significantly altered the approach to providing financial assistance to states.  It effectively ended the practice of classifying states under the Special Category Status category.  The commission shifted towards a more needs-based approach, evaluating the specific requirements of each state, irrespective of their prior SCS designation.  This change aimed to create a more transparent and objective system of resource allocation.


**3. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2010, consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate that all NGOs receiving foreign funds must open a designated FCRA account in any branch of State Bank of India.
2.  The FCRA permits the use of up to 50% of received foreign funds for administrative expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While post-2020 amendments to the FCRA do require NGOs receiving foreign funds to open a designated FCRA account, it must be in a specified branch of the State Bank of India, specifically in New Delhi.  The restriction to a particular branch is a crucial detail that distinguishes it from the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2020 amendments to the FCRA significantly reduced the permissible usage of foreign funds for administrative expenses.  The limit was lowered from 50% to 20%. This change aimed to enhance transparency and ensure that the majority of foreign contributions are utilized for the intended purposes of the NGOs, rather than administrative overheads.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Post Office Act, 2023:**

1. The Act introduces stringent penal provisions for violations related to postal services, including hefty fines and imprisonment.
2. The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) will have the power to regulate matters such as charges for postal services and the sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A notable feature of the Post Office Act, 2023, is the *absence* of stringent penal provisions.  The Act does not prescribe any penalties for violations related to postal services. This is a significant departure from previous legislation and reflects a policy shift towards a more lenient regulatory approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The Post Office Act, 2023, grants the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) the authority to regulate various aspects of postal services, including setting charges for services and overseeing the supply and sale of postage stamps.  This centralization of regulatory power aims to improve efficiency and consistency in the management of postal operations.


**5. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole designated agency in the Union Government responsible for handling grievances.
2.  CPGRAMS is an online platform that connects citizens directly with all Ministries/Departments of the Government of India, but not with state-level authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DARPG (under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances, and Pensions) plays a significant role in grievance redressal, it is not the *sole* designated agency at the Union Government level.  The Directorate of Public Grievances, under the Cabinet Secretariat, also handles grievances.  The existence of multiple agencies reflects a distributed approach to managing citizen complaints.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is a crucial online platform for grievance redressal, connecting citizens with Ministries/Departments at the Union level.  Importantly,  it also extends its reach to state-level authorities, enabling a more comprehensive system of complaint management across different levels of government.  The interconnectivity of CPGRAMS is a key aspect of its effectiveness.


**6. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are partially designated as a Restricted Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
2.  Foreign nationals from all countries, including Bhutan, require special permits to enter Protected or Restricted Areas in India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Andaman & Nicobar Islands are entirely designated as a Restricted Area, not partially, under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.  This complete restriction reflects the sensitive geographical and strategic importance of the islands.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, mandates that foreign nationals from all countries, except Bhutan, require special permits to enter Protected or Restricted Areas in India.  This regulation is in place to maintain security and control access to these sensitive regions.  The exception for Bhutanese citizens reflects the unique diplomatic relationship between India and Bhutan.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India:**

1.  The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part IV of the Indian Constitution.
2.  The NHRC's accreditation by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has been consistently maintained at the 'A' status since its first accreditation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional, body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not through a constitutional provision. This distinction is important in understanding its powers and limitations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's accreditation by GANHRI has not been consistently maintained at 'A' status.  There have been instances where its accreditation has been deferred due to concerns regarding various factors, including staff diversity and action taken to protect marginalized groups.  This highlights the ongoing need for the NHRC to meet international standards for human rights protection.


**8. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on the preparation of Gram Panchayat Development Plans (GPDPs) for the fiscal year, excluding block and district-level plans.
2.  The campaign utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps at the Gram Sabha level.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People's Plan Campaign, has a broader scope than just GPDPs. While GPDPs are a central component, the campaign also involves the preparation of Block Panchayat Development Plans and District Panchayat Development Plans.  This multi-tiered approach ensures comprehensive planning across all levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key element of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is the utilization of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify thematic developmental gaps.  This data-driven approach ensures that planning is informed by objective assessments of existing needs and priorities at the Gram Sabha level, promoting evidence-based decision-making.  The PDI helps in targeting resources effectively.


**9. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly conducts the audits of all three levels of Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs) and Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) through its own field offices.
2. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, facilitates online audits of panchayat accounts and has received international recognition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CAG has overall responsibility and supervisory control over the audit of local bodies, it doesn't directly conduct all audits. The CAG exercises its control and supervision through Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in most states. These officers work under the technical guidance and supervision of the CAG.  The CAG does not maintain its own field offices dedicated solely to auditing PRIs and ULBs.

Statement 2 is correct. The AuditOnline application, developed by the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, is indeed designed to facilitate online audits of panchayat accounts, promoting transparency and accountability. This initiative has been recognized internationally, receiving awards like the World Summit on Information Society Prizes 2023.


**10. With reference to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, as amended, applies only to commercial disputes and excludes other types of disputes like civil or family matters.
2. The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was constituted by the Supreme Court of India to oversee the implementation of mediation and conciliation, and has developed an online mediation training web portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, and its subsequent amendments, have a broad scope. It applies to various types of disputes, including not only commercial but also civil and other types of disputes.  This wide applicability is a key feature of the Act's design to promote ADR mechanisms across different sectors.

Statement 2 is correct. The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC) was indeed established by the Supreme Court of India to promote and oversee the implementation of mediation and conciliation in the country.  Further, the MCPC, in collaboration with NALSA, has developed an online mediation training web portal to enhance the capacity of legal professionals and promote ADR mechanisms.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in India:**

1. The Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee (MCPC), constituted by the Supreme Court in 2005, plays a crucial role in the implementation of ADR mechanisms, and recently launched an online mediation training web portal.
2. The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, amended in 2015, 2019, and 2021, exclusively governs commercial arbitrations and doesn't encompass other types of disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The MCPC, established by the Supreme Court, is indeed instrumental in promoting ADR mechanisms in India.  The recent launch of the online mediation training portal further underscores its active role.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, applies to all kinds of arbitrations, not just commercial ones.  The amendments mentioned reflect its broader scope and continuous evolution to address various types of disputes.  The statement incorrectly limits the Act's application.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the role of the MCPC or incorrectly define the scope of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.


**2. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, allocating this share based solely on population data from the 2011 census.
2.  Grants-in-aid to states, as per Article 275, are discretionary and not based on any specific formula or criteria set by the Finance Commission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states,  it did *not* base this allocation solely on the 2011 census population data.  The allocation considered multiple factors, including income distance, area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Grants-in-aid are provided under Article 275, but they are not entirely discretionary.  The Finance Commission's recommendations significantly influence the allocation of these grants, suggesting a structured, albeit not rigidly formulaic, approach. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent both the criteria used by the Finance Commission in revenue sharing and the nature of grants-in-aid.


**3. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provision for granting Special Category Status is explicitly mentioned in Articles 370 and 371.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the complete abolishment of the SCS, ending all special funding patterns for states previously designated as SCS states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Constitution doesn't explicitly mention a provision for granting Special Category Status.  While various Articles (371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J) provide special provisions to certain states, they don't define or create the category of "Special Category Status" itself.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations did lead to the discontinuation of SCS as a formal designation. However, it did *not* end all special funding patterns for states that previously benefitted from SCS.  Some states continue to receive special funding based on other recommendations and considerations, such as those from the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in both statements regarding the constitutional basis of SCS and the impact of the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), was primarily a response to the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule currently applies to all the Northeastern states of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule, as per Article 244(2), resulted from the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The Nehru Committee focused on different aspects of constitutional development.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule does *not* apply to all Northeastern states. It applies to specific areas within four states: Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram.  Other Northeastern states have different administrative arrangements. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent both the committee responsible for the Sixth Schedule's creation and its geographical application.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), 2020:**

1.  The amended FCRA mandates that all NGOs receiving foreign funds must open a designated FCRA account in any branch of their choosing, regardless of location.
2. Post-2020 amendment, NGOs can utilize up to 50% of the received foreign contribution to meet administrative expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The amended FCRA mandates that NGOs must open a designated FCRA account, but it specifies that this account must be in a branch of the State Bank of India in New Delhi. The choice of branch is restricted.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2020 amendment to the FCRA *reduced* the permissible usage of foreign contribution for administrative expenses to a maximum of 20%, down from the previous 50%. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the stipulations of the FCRA regarding account location and administrative expense allocation.


**6. With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduces stringent penal provisions for any violation of its regulations, including hefty fines and imprisonment.
2. The Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) will have the authority to regulate matters such as charges for postal services, but not the sale of postage stamps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Post Office Act, 2023, notably *lacks* penal provisions.  There are no prescribed penalties for violations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DGPS's authority extends to regulating charges for postal services *and* the supply and sale of postage stamps, as explicitly stated in the Act. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the presence or absence of penal provisions and the extent of the DGPS's regulatory powers.


**7.  With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC's accreditation by the Global Alliance of National Human Rights Institutions (GANHRI) has been consistently maintained at 'A' status since its first accreditation in 1999.
2. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC's GANHRI accreditation has faced recent deferrals, indicating that its 'A' status has not been consistently maintained.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC is a *statutory*, not a constitutional, body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not through a constitutional provision.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent both the history of the NHRC's accreditation and its constitutional standing.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 under the Ministry of Panchayati Raj, focuses solely on the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for the next financial year.
2.  The campaign's thematic approach is entirely based on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) without any consideration for local needs or the Panchayat Development Index (PDI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is indeed concerned with PDP preparation, it is not limited to just the next financial year.  The campaign aims for continuous improvement and participation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The thematic approach of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan is *not* solely based on SDGs. It incorporates local needs and utilizes the PDI to identify developmental gaps. The PDI plays a crucial role in shaping the thematic focus. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope and approach of the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.


**9. With reference to the auditing of local bodies in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the second such center in India, aiming to promote global best practices in local governance auditing.
2. The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) exercises control and supervision over the audit of local bodies through the Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) in all states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The iCAL in Rajkot is the *first* such center in India, not the second.  There is no other similar center mentioned in the given context.

Statement 2 is incorrect, while the CAG does exercise control and supervision over local body audits through ELFAs/DLFAs, this mechanism is not present in *all* states. The statement presents an overgeneralization.  The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent both the number of iCAL centers in India and the CAG's reach in local body audits.



**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only for offenses against laws relating to matters where the Union's executive power extends.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to death sentences, regardless of whether the conviction was by a court-martial or a civilian court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute sentences in cases where the sentence is by a court-martial *or* for an offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  The statement incorrectly restricts the President's power to only one of these categories, omitting the court-martial provision.  The President's power is broader than what statement 1 suggests.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 clearly encompasses the President's power to deal with death sentences.  The source of the conviction—court-martial or civilian court—does not limit this power.  The Constitution grants this authority irrespective of the type of court that handed down the death penalty.


**2. With reference to curative petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition, and it is the final legal recourse available.
2.  To be successful, a curative petition must demonstrate a violation of principles of natural justice, or a judge's undisclosed conflict of interest, or any other procedural irregularity that significantly impacts the fairness of the trial.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  A curative petition is indeed the last resort available in the Indian judicial system after all other avenues, including a review petition (under Article 137), have been exhausted. It is considered the final constitutional remedy.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The grounds for a curative petition, as established in the case of *Rupa Ashok Hurra v. Ashok Hurra*,  include demonstrating a violation of principles of natural justice, a judge's failure to disclose a connection with the subject matter (implying bias), or an apprehension of bias that significantly affects the petitioner's case.  The statement accurately reflects these established grounds.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established as a state-sponsored initiative primarily funded by state budgets to expedite the disposal of rape and POCSO Act cases.
2. The Department of Justice, Ministry of Law and Justice, is responsible for the implementation of the FTSC scheme, which was launched in 2019 and extended to 2026.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally* sponsored scheme, not state-sponsored. Their funding comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, a central government initiative, not state budgets.  The statement misrepresents the funding source and the level of government responsible.

Statement 2 is correct. The Department of Justice under the Ministry of Law and Justice is responsible for implementing the FTSC scheme. The launch year (2019) and extension to 2026 are also accurately stated.


**4. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018 as 'Sabki Yojana Sabka Vikas,' aims to prepare Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) for 2025-26 by solely engaging elected representatives at all three tiers of Panchayats.
2.  The Abhiyan's thematic approach involves localizing Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) using a 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach,' and utilizes the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) to identify developmental gaps.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan does aim to prepare PDPs for 2025-26, it involves far more than just elected representatives.  The implementation explicitly mentions the active participation of government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders. The statement wrongly limits participation to elected officials.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Abhiyan's thematic approach is indeed based on localizing SDGs using the 'Whole of Government and Whole of Society' approach.  The use of the PDI to identify developmental gaps is also an accurate component of the Abhiyan's methodology.


**5. With reference to the Anti-Defection Law, consider the following statements:**

1. The Anti-Defection Law, introduced through the 52nd Amendment Act of 1985, disqualifies MLAs who vote against their party's direction in the House, even if the party subsequently condones the act.
2.  The law allows for the merger of a political party with another, provided that at least two-thirds of its legislators agree to the merger, and this merger does not lead to disqualification under the anti-defection law.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Anti-Defection Law does disqualify MLAs for voting against their party's direction, but it includes a crucial exception. If the party condones the act within 15 days, disqualification does not occur. The statement omits this important caveat.

Statement 2 is correct. The law explicitly permits the merger of political parties under specific conditions—a two-thirds majority of legislators agreeing to the merger.  Such a merger is considered an exception to the anti-defection provisions and does not lead to disqualification.


**6. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data while granting individuals the right to data portability, allowing them to transfer their data easily between different data fiduciaries.
2.  The Act designates certain data fiduciaries as Significant Data Fiduciaries (SDFs) based on factors such as the volume and sensitivity of data processed and potential risks to data principals' rights, including risks to national security and public order.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act aims to regulate the processing of digital personal data and protect individuals' rights, data portability is not explicitly mentioned as a core right granted by the Act. The statement introduces a feature not directly addressed in the Act's core provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does indeed identify and classify certain data fiduciaries as SDFs based on the criteria mentioned: volume and sensitivity of data, risks to data principals, and potential impact on national security, public order, etc.  The statement accurately reflects this aspect of the Act.


**7. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and mandates that all evidence presented in court must be in digital format, regardless of the original form.
2.  The Act introduces provisions for joint trials, allowing the trial of multiple accused persons simultaneously, even if some have absconded and arrest warrants are pending.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023,  replaces the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, and allows for digital evidence, but it doesn't mandate *all* evidence to be in digital format.  The statement incorrectly presents a sweeping requirement not present in the Act.  It allows for both digital and paper records as evidence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does introduce provisions for joint trials, enabling the simultaneous trial of multiple accused individuals, even if some are absconding, which is a significant procedural change.


**8. With reference to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, and introduces a provision for mandatory forensic investigation for all offenses, regardless of the severity of punishment.
2.  The Act mandates the release on bail of first-time offenders who have served one-third of their maximum sentence, except for offenses punishable by death or life imprisonment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, does replace the CrPC, 1973, and emphasizes forensic investigation, it does *not* make it mandatory for *all* offenses.  The mandatory provision is specifically for offenses punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the mandatory forensic investigation clause.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Act does indeed provide for the release on bail of first-time offenders who have served one-third of their maximum sentence.  The exception for offenses punishable by death or life imprisonment is also accurately stated.  There might be minor variations in specific conditions depending on judicial interpretations, but the core provision is correctly described.


**9.  With reference to the Mediation Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act defines mediation to include only pre-litigation mediation and excludes online or community mediation.
2. The Act establishes a Mediation Council of India (MCI) with a chairperson and several full-time and part-time members, including government officials, to oversee and regulate mediation practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mediation Act, 2023, provides a broad definition of mediation, explicitly encompassing pre-litigation mediation, online mediation, and community mediation. The statement incorrectly restricts the definition.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act does establish the MCI with a structure that includes a chairperson, full-time members with expertise in mediation, part-time members (including government officials), and ex-officio members.  The description accurately reflects the composition and purpose of the council.


**10. With reference to Article 22 of the Indian Constitution (Protection in case of arrest and detention), consider the following statements:**

1. Article 22 guarantees the right to be informed of the grounds of arrest and detention, and the right to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner, but only for persons detained under preventive detention laws.
2.  The failure to provide documents relied upon for preventive detention within a reasonable timeframe constitutes a violation of Article 22(5), which guarantees the right to make an effective representation against detention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 22's protections regarding informing of grounds of arrest and the right to legal counsel apply to *all* arrests and detentions, *except* those under preventive detention laws (Article 22(3)).  The statement incorrectly limits these protections to preventive detention cases only.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 22(5) grants the right to make an effective representation against detention.  The timely provision of relevant documents is crucial for exercising this right; failure to do so or significant delay would indeed be considered a violation of this article.


**11. With reference to personality rights in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Personality rights, encompassing the protection of a person's name, image, voice, etc., are explicitly defined and protected under a specific statute in India.
2.  Posthumous personality rights are protected through defamation suits under the Indian Penal Code and the Emblems and Names (Prevention of Improper Use) Act, 1950, which protects the unauthorized use of certain dignitaries' names and symbols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While personality rights are recognized and protected in India, they are not explicitly defined in a single, dedicated statute.  Their protection is derived from the right to privacy and, in certain aspects, the right to property. The statement incorrectly asserts the existence of a specific statute.

Statement 2 is correct.  Posthumous protection of personality rights is achieved through defamation suits under the IPC, which protects reputation even after death.  The Emblems and Names Act provides additional protection against the misuse of specific dignitaries' names and symbols.  The statement accurately outlines these legal avenues.


**12. With reference to the Right to Information Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Information Commission (CIC) and State Information Commissions (SICs) are appointed for a fixed term of 5 years or until they attain the age of 65 years, whichever is earlier.
2.  The RTI Act, 2005, exempts personal information from disclosure, with some limited exceptions, as amended by the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the term of Information Commissioners is limited, the exact duration isn't universally 5 years or until age 65.  The specific term and age limit might vary based on the rules and regulations governing their appointments at the central and state levels.  The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate timeframe.

Statement 2 is correct. The RTI Act does exempt personal information from disclosure, with certain exceptions.  The Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023, further strengthens these provisions for personal data protection, making it more difficult to disclose such information.


**13. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Aadhaar card, issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), serves as conclusive legal proof of an individual's date of birth and citizenship.
2.  UIDAI can deactivate or delete an Aadhaar number if it detects any irregularities or fraudulent activities associated with the Aadhaar enrollment or usage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Aadhaar is widely used to establish identity, the Supreme Court has clarified that it is not conclusive legal proof of date of birth.  Similarly, Aadhaar does not independently establish citizenship; other documents are required to prove citizenship.  The statement misrepresents Aadhaar's legal standing regarding date of birth and citizenship.

Statement 2 is correct. UIDAI does have the authority to deactivate or delete an Aadhaar number if it detects any irregularities, including fraudulent activities during enrollment or subsequent misuse of the Aadhaar number.  The statement accurately reflects UIDAI's power to manage the integrity of the Aadhaar database.


**14. With reference to the Common Service Centres (CSC) scheme, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a private sector company established to implement the CSC scheme, and it receives funding primarily from private investments.
2.  CSCs are front-end delivery points for government services, but they do not offer private sector or social sector services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSC SPV is *not* a private sector company; it's set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT under the Companies Act, 1956.  Its funding is primarily from government sources, not private investments. The statement incorrectly characterizes the SPV's nature and funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  CSCs are indeed front-end delivery points for government services (G2C), but they also provide services from the private sector (B2C) and social sector organizations.  The statement wrongly restricts the services offered by CSCs.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences only in cases where the death penalty has been awarded.
2.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, regardless of whether the sentence was imposed by a court-martial or a civil court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 does deal with death sentences, its scope is broader.  It encompasses pardons, reprieves, respites, remission, and commutation of sentences for various offenses, not limited to capital punishment.  The President's mercy power extends to cases where sentences are awarded by court-martials or civil courts for offenses against laws under the Union's executive power.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the authority to deal with sentences in cases arising from offenses against any law falling under the Union's executive power. This includes sentences from both court-martials (military courts) and civil courts. The power is not restricted to a specific type of court.  This broad scope reflects the President's role as the supreme executive authority of the Union.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Indian Supreme Court, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the Supreme Court has dismissed a review petition, and it is the final legal recourse available.
2.  The grounds for filing a curative petition include allegations of a violation of principles of natural justice or a judge's failure to disclose a conflict of interest, but not mere apprehension of bias.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is indeed the last resort after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.  It's designed as a safety valve to address exceptional circumstances where fundamental justice may have been overlooked in earlier proceedings.  No further legal recourse is available after a curative petition is decided.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While violations of natural justice and undisclosed conflicts of interest are valid grounds, mere apprehension of bias, without concrete evidence of actual bias, is generally insufficient to justify a curative petition. The Supreme Court has established a high threshold for the acceptance of curative petitions due to their extraordinary nature and to avoid frivolous litigation.  The petitioner needs to present compelling evidence to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established solely to address the backlog of cases under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  The funding for FTSCs is entirely provided by the state governments, with no contribution from the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While FTSCs significantly focus on POCSO Act cases, their mandate is broader. They're designed to expedite the disposal of *all* rape cases, in addition to those under the POCSO Act.  Their establishment reflects a concerted effort to address the pervasive issue of sexual violence and ensure timely justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. FTSCs are a centrally sponsored scheme, meaning the central government bears a significant portion of the expenditure.  The Nirbhaya Fund is the primary source of funding for this initiative, indicating a national commitment to strengthening the judicial system's response to sexual offenses. State governments also contribute to the implementation and infrastructure but not as the sole funder.



**4. With reference to the devolution of taxes between the Union and States in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission recommends the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, including corporation tax and central GST, but not personal income tax.
2.  Horizontal devolution refers to the distribution of funds among states based solely on population size, as determined by the most recent census.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Finance Commission's recommendations cover the distribution of taxes levied and collected by the Union, and this *does* include personal income tax, corporation tax, and central GST.  The Commission plays a crucial role in ensuring a fair and equitable distribution of resources between the Union and States, which is a vital aspect of India's fiscal federalism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Horizontal devolution is far more nuanced than just population size.  The 15th Finance Commission, for instance, considered multiple criteria, including income distance, area, population (but not solely the most recent census), demographic performance, forest cover, and tax efforts, to determine the horizontal allocation among states.  This multi-faceted approach reflects the complexities of regional disparities and developmental needs.


**5. With reference to Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The criteria for granting SCS are solely based on the state's geographical location and its contribution to national security.
2.  The granting of SCS is a permanent designation that cannot be revoked.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The criteria for granting SCS are broader than just geographical location and national security contributions. They consider socio-economic factors, infrastructure deficits, and developmental challenges faced by a state.  The aim is to provide additional central assistance to states that need it to bridge developmental gaps.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The designation of SCS is not permanent. While initially granted for a specific period, it can be reviewed and potentially renewed or even revoked depending on the state's progress and changing circumstances.  The decision to grant or revoke SCS rests with the central government, based on assessments of the state's needs and overall national priorities.


**6. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and explicitly recognized the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act is the Ministry of Home Affairs.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While the RTI Act, 2005, did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, it did *not* explicitly declare the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 19. The Supreme Court, in cases like *Raj Narayan v. State of UP*, interpreted Article 19 to encompass the right to information, but this interpretation predates and informs the RTI Act, not the other way around. The RTI Act codified and strengthened the right, but it didn't create it as a fundamental right.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The coordinating agency for the RTI Act is the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT), under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P), not the Ministry of Home Affairs.  The DoPT plays a crucial role in the implementation and oversight of the Act.


**7. With reference to the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPA has the power to impose penalties for misleading advertisements, including imprisonment for manufacturers and endorsers.
2. The CCPA's consumer mediation cells are exclusively located in the offices of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CCPA possesses significant powers to regulate misleading advertisements, including imposing substantial fines and even imprisonment for repeat offenses. This reflects its mandate to protect consumers from unfair trade practices and deceptive marketing.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CCPA does have consumer mediation cells attached to the NCDRC and its regional benches, these cells are not exclusively located there.  They're also established at the district and state commission levels to facilitate easier access to dispute resolution mechanisms for consumers across the country. The decentralized structure enhances the accessibility and effectiveness of the mediation process.


**8. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Ministry of Finance is responsible for regulating the receipt and utilization of foreign contributions by NGOs.
2.  Diversion of foreign funds for anti-national activities can lead to the denial or cancellation of FCRA registration for an NGO.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), not the Ministry of Finance, is responsible for regulating the receipt and utilization of foreign contributions by NGOs under the FCRA.  The MHA's role in this context is crucial to ensure that foreign funding doesn't compromise national security or public order.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FCRA explicitly provides for the denial or cancellation of registration for NGOs found to be diverting foreign funds for activities that are detrimental to national interest, including anti-national activities or inciting violence.  The government's strict oversight of foreign funding to NGOs is aimed at maintaining transparency and preventing misuse of such funds.


**9. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands is designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
2.  Foreigners require special permits to visit Protected or Restricted Areas, regardless of their nationality.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, designates the entire Union Territory of Andaman & Nicobar Islands as a Restricted Area.  This reflects the sensitive geographical location and strategic importance of these islands.  The designation is meant to regulate access for security and environmental protection reasons.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While special permits are generally required for foreigners to enter Protected or Restricted Areas, there's an exception for citizens of Bhutan.  This reflects the unique relationship between India and Bhutan.  Other foreigners need to demonstrate compelling reasons to be granted permission to visit these areas.


**10. With reference to the Indian Passport system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian government can issue passports only to citizens of India.
2.  There are only two types of passports issued in India: Ordinary and Diplomatic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although passports are primarily issued to Indian citizens, the government retains the power to issue passports to non-citizens in specific circumstances, usually when deemed to be in the public interest. This provision allows for flexibility in handling exceptional cases, such as granting travel documents to stateless persons or those seeking political asylum.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  There are three types of passports issued in India: Ordinary (blue), Diplomatic (white), and Official (maroon).  The different types reflect the varied needs and roles of individuals traveling on behalf of the government or in private capacities.  The classification of passports is based on the purpose and status of the holder.


**11. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSCs are primarily focused on providing government services to urban citizens.
2.  The CSC Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) is a government department under the Ministry of Rural Development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSCs are designed to deliver government and private sector services to *rural* citizens.  Their reach extends to remote and underserved areas, making them a vital instrument for bridging the digital divide.  They are crucial for enhancing access to services in areas lacking adequate infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSC SPV is not a government department.  It's a special purpose vehicle (SPV) set up under the Companies Act, 1956, and overseen by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not the Ministry of Rural Development.  The SPV structure allows for greater flexibility and efficiency in managing the implementation of the CSC scheme.


**12.  With reference to the Telecommunications Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act maintains the existing framework for spectrum allocation, primarily through administrative allocation.
2.  The Act explicitly regulates Over-the-Top (OTT) platforms under its provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, introduces a shift in spectrum allocation, moving towards a greater emphasis on auctions for spectrum allocation. While administrative allocation is retained for specific purposes like national security and defense, the overall approach is designed to promote greater transparency and efficiency in spectrum management.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Telecommunications Act, 2023, notably *does not* regulate OTT platforms. This omission reflects a deliberate decision to address OTT regulation separately, possibly through future legislation or regulatory frameworks.  The Act primarily focuses on the underlying telecommunications infrastructure and services.


**13. With reference to the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) is the sole designated agency responsible for handling grievances at the Union Government level.
2.  CPGRAMS is a platform exclusively for addressing grievances related to corruption within government agencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DARPG plays a significant role, it is not the *sole* agency handling grievances at the Union Government level.  The Directorate of Public Grievances, under the Cabinet Secretariat, also has a crucial role in this process.  This division of responsibilities ensures a more comprehensive and effective grievance redressal system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is a broader platform designed to address a wide range of citizen grievances, not just those related to corruption.  While corruption complaints are certainly handled through CPGRAMS, it covers various issues related to service delivery across different ministries and departments.  Its scope encompasses various citizen concerns.


**14. With reference to internet shutdowns in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court of India has upheld indefinite internet shutdowns as a valid exercise of governmental power under the Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services Rules, 2017.
2. The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, are notified under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Supreme Court, in *Anuradha Bhasin v. Union of India*, explicitly rejected the legality of indefinite internet shutdowns.  The Court emphasized that restrictions on internet access, as a form of freedom of speech and expression, must be temporary and proportionate to the threat.  Indefinite shutdowns were deemed disproportionate and thus unconstitutional.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Temporary Suspension of Telecom Services (Public Emergency or Public Safety) Rules, 2017, are indeed notified under the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885.  This Act provides the legal basis for the government to regulate telecommunications services, including the temporary suspension of such services in specific circumstances.  The 2017 Rules offer a framework for implementing these powers.


**15. With reference to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, consider the following statements:**

1. The IPC, 1860, does not explicitly define "organized crime" but includes provisions addressing individual offenses commonly associated with such criminal activities.
2.  The IPC, 1860, mandates the death penalty for murder committed by a group on grounds of caste or community, even if there is no intent to cause death.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IPC, 1860, does not have a singular, comprehensive definition of "organized crime." However, it contains provisions for various offenses frequently associated with organized crime, such as murder, extortion, kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy.  The absence of a specific definition doesn't negate the applicability of the IPC to such activities.  Individual offenses are addressed, allowing for prosecution based on the specific actions committed.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the IPC prescribes severe punishments for murder committed by a group based on caste or community, it does not automatically mandate the death penalty. The punishment is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of the case, including the intent and the level of culpability of the accused.  The presence of aggravating factors such as caste-based violence can increase the severity of the sentence, but the death penalty is not mandatory.


**16. With reference to the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act introduces provisions for mandatory forensic investigations for all offenses.
2.  The Act repeals the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, mandates forensic investigation only for specific offenses, primarily those punishable with imprisonment of seven years or more. This targeted approach ensures that resources are focused on serious crimes where forensic evidence is most crucial.  It is not a blanket mandate across all offenses.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023, replaces the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (CrPC).  This significant change reflects an effort to modernize and streamline the criminal justice process in India. The new Code aims to improve efficiency and provide a more effective framework for handling criminal cases.


**1. With reference to the President's power on mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 empowers the President to grant pardons only in cases where the sentence is awarded by a court-martial.
2.  The President's power to commute a death sentence applies only to offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 72 of the Indian Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit, or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offense.  This power extends beyond sentences awarded by court-martials; it includes sentences from ordinary courts as well. The scope is broader than just court-martial cases.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the President's power under Article 72 does indeed cover offenses against laws relating to matters under the Union's executive power, it's not limited to only those offenses. The power extends to all offenses, including those falling under state jurisdiction, where a death sentence is involved.  The provision explicitly mentions the power to commute death sentences. The limitation is the type of sentence (death), not the nature of the offense.


**2. With reference to Curative Petitions in the Supreme Court of India, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2.  The Supreme Court's curative jurisdiction is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court has dismissed their review petition (under Article 137), not a writ petition.  Writ petitions are a different form of legal recourse altogether. Curative petitions are specifically designed to address exceptional circumstances after all other avenues have been exhausted, including review petitions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The curative jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  It's derived from Article 142, which grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice. The curative petition evolved through judicial pronouncements and case law, not through a direct constitutional mandate.  The power stems from the inherent judicial authority to ensure justice in exceptional cases.


**3. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established under a state-sponsored scheme to expedite the disposal of cases under the POCSO Act.
2.  The funding for FTSCs is primarily sourced from the National Rural Health Mission.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are established under a centrally sponsored scheme, not a state-sponsored one.  The initiative is driven by the central government, not individual states, aiming for nationwide efficiency in handling specific types of cases. The scheme's implementation is a collaborative effort between the central government and states/UTs.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The funding for FTSCs comes from the Nirbhaya Fund, not the National Rural Health Mission. The Nirbhaya Fund is specifically dedicated to initiatives related to women's safety and security, aligning directly with the FTSCs' focus on rape cases and POCSO Act cases.  The NRHM focuses on health-related initiatives in rural areas.


**4. With reference to the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) 1973, consider the following statements:**

1. The CrPC 1973 mandates forensic investigation for all offenses, regardless of the prescribed punishment.
2.  The CrPC 1973 empowers a Magistrate to order the provision of voice samples only in cases involving murder.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CrPC 1973 mandates forensic investigation only for offenses punishable with at least seven years of imprisonment. Not all offenses require forensic investigation under this code; the threshold is based on the severity of the potential sentence.  This reflects a prioritization of resources and investigation efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CrPC 1973 empowers a Magistrate to order the provision of various specimens, including voice samples,  in a broader range of cases than just murder. The power to collect evidence extends to situations where such evidence could be relevant to the investigation, not limited to a specific offense. The Magistrate's power is determined by the relevance of the evidence to the case.


**5. With reference to the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act allows for the admissibility of only handwritten electronic records as evidence.
2. The Act prohibits oral evidence from being given electronically in court proceedings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam 2023 allows for the admissibility of both electronic and digital records as evidence, carrying the same legal weight as paper records.  The Act aims to modernize evidentiary procedures and accommodate the increasing reliance on digital formats.  Handwritten electronic records are only a subset of the broader category of admissible evidence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Act explicitly permits oral evidence to be given electronically. This provision is intended to improve accessibility and efficiency in court proceedings, especially in cases where witnesses may be geographically dispersed or have mobility challenges.  The electronic submission of oral evidence is a key feature of the updated legal framework.


**6.  With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act applies only to the processing of digital personal data within India.
2. The Act mandates the consent of the data principal for all forms of personal data processing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act's applicability extends beyond the processing of digital personal data solely within India. It also covers processing of personal data outside India if that processing is for offering goods or services in India. This reflects the global reach of digital interactions and the need for consistent data protection standards.  The geographical limitation is not absolute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act generally requires the consent of the data principal for processing personal data, there are exceptions. Consent isn't needed for certain "legitimate uses," such as providing government benefits or services, or in medical emergencies. The requirement for consent is not universal but rather carefully calibrated to balance individual rights with practical necessities.


**7. With reference to the powers of the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI has the power to directly impose fines on data principals for violating the Act.
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are heard by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPBI doesn't directly impose fines on data principals.  Its role is to monitor compliance, investigate complaints, and make recommendations or directives to data fiduciaries (those processing the data).  The imposition of penalties is a separate process, often involving other legal mechanisms. The board's power is primarily regulatory and investigatory, not directly punitive.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are heard by the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court. This reflects the specialized nature of data protection issues and the establishment of a dedicated appellate body to handle such disputes efficiently.  The Supreme Court's involvement would typically be at a later stage, through special leave petitions.


**8. With reference to the  Right to Information Act (RTI) 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act mandates the disclosure of all information held by public authorities, without any exceptions.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) is directly accountable to the Parliament of India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RTI Act does not mandate the disclosure of *all* information held by public authorities.  Section 8 of the Act specifies several categories of information that are exempt from disclosure, such as information concerning national security, strategic information, cabinet papers, etc.  The right to information is balanced with considerations of national interest and other legitimate concerns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CIC is not directly accountable to the Parliament.  While the Act establishes the CIC to oversee the implementation of the RTI Act, its independence is crucial. The CIC's members are appointed by the President, and their independence from political influence is designed to protect the integrity of the RTI process.  Parliamentary oversight is indirect, primarily through budgetary processes and legislative amendments.


**9. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar is considered legally valid proof of citizenship in India.
2. The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) can unilaterally deactivate any Aadhaar card.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Aadhaar is widely used for identity verification, it is not legally valid proof of citizenship in India.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes and documentation, not solely through the Aadhaar card. The Aadhaar card primarily serves as a unique identification number, not a definitive proof of citizenship.

Statement 2 is correct. The UIDAI does have the power to unilaterally deactivate an Aadhaar card under certain circumstances.  This power is primarily exercised in cases of suspected fraudulent activity, misuse of the Aadhaar system, or non-compliance with the Act's provisions. The authority is designed to maintain the integrity and security of the Aadhaar database.


**10. With reference to Indian Passports, consider the following statements:**

1. Possession of an Indian passport is mandatory for all Indian citizens traveling abroad.
2.  The Indian government can issue passports only to citizens of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While an Indian passport is the standard travel document for Indian citizens going abroad, it's not strictly mandatory in all situations. The government can grant exemptions for specific cases or categories of individuals, considering factors such as age, health, or other exceptional circumstances. The requirement is not absolute.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Indian government can issue passports to individuals who are not citizens of India under certain circumstances.  This power is typically exercised in cases of public interest, such as humanitarian aid or diplomatic purposes.  The issuance of passports is not limited solely to Indian citizens.  The government retains discretionary powers in this regard.


**11. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Constitution.
2. The NHRC has the power to issue binding orders on government bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NHRC is a statutory body, not a constitutional body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not directly through the Constitution. Its mandate and powers are derived from legislation, not from a specific constitutional provision.  The constitutional basis is indirect, through the fundamental rights protected in Part III.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC's orders are not legally binding on government bodies. While the Commission's recommendations carry significant weight and moral authority, they are not legally enforceable.  The NHRC relies on persuasion and moral suasion to influence government actions, not through coercive legal powers. Its power is primarily recommendatory and investigative.


**12. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on urban local body development planning.
2. The Panchayat Development Index (PDI) is not used in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, or People's Plan Campaign, involves preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs) at all three tiers of Panchayats.  It's not limited to urban local bodies; its primary focus is on rural development planning through participatory mechanisms.  The scope is broader than just urban areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PDI is explicitly used in the preparation of PDPs under the Jan Yojana Abhiyan.  The PDI serves as a tool for identifying thematic developmental gaps and guiding the planning process at the Panchayat level. The index plays a crucial role in the overall planning framework.  It informs the identification of priority areas for development.


**13. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) directly audits the accounts of all local bodies in India.
2. The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) is a UN agency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAG doesn't directly audit all local bodies' accounts.  While the CAG's mandate covers auditing of local bodies, the actual audits are often conducted through Examiner of Local Fund Accounts (ELFA) or Director of Local Fund Accounts (DLFA) at the state level, under the CAG's overall supervision.  The CAG's role is primarily supervisory and ensures consistency in auditing standards, not direct execution of every audit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL is not a UN agency. It's an initiative established within India, aiming to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies.  The center is domestically established, not an international organization.  Its significance lies in its potential to influence auditing practices globally, but it's not directly affiliated with the UN.


**14. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are established under the Cantonments Act, 2006.
2.  Cantonment Boards function independently of state governments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Cantonment Boards are established under the Cantonments Act, 2006.  This Act provides the legal framework for their establishment, functions, and powers.  The Act defines their jurisdiction and responsibilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Cantonment Boards have a degree of autonomy, they are not entirely independent of state governments.  Their functions and administrative matters are subject to certain regulations and oversight by the state governments.  The relationship between the boards and state governments is a complex one involving both autonomy and state supervision.  Complete independence is not the case.


**15. With reference to the Right to be Forgotten (RTBF), consider the following statements:**

1. The RTBF is an absolute right recognized under Indian law.
2. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 explicitly incorporates the RTBF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RTBF is not an absolute right under Indian law. While the Supreme Court has recognized aspects of it as part of the right to life under Article 21, it's not an unqualified right.  Balancing the RTBF with other rights and public interests is a key consideration.  Its application is subject to judicial interpretation and contextual factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 does not explicitly mention or incorporate the RTBF.  While the Act deals with data protection, the specific concept of the RTBF, as it exists in some other jurisdictions, is not explicitly defined or provided for within the Act.  The Act focuses on broader data protection principles.


**16. With reference to Inner Line Permits (ILP), consider the following statements:**

1. ILP is applicable to all states in North-Eastern India.
2.  Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) are eligible to obtain an ILP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ILP is not applicable to all states in North-Eastern India.  It's currently implemented in Arunachal Pradesh, Mizoram, Nagaland, and Manipur.  Other states in the region do not have the ILP system in place.  The system is not uniformly applied across the entire region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NRIs are not eligible to obtain a regular ILP.  They need to apply for a Protected/Restricted Area Permit, which has different requirements and restrictions.  The ILP system is primarily for Indian citizens residing within the country, not for those living abroad for extended periods.  The distinction reflects different immigration and access regulations.


**17. With reference to Common Service Centres (CSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSCs are primarily focused on providing services to urban populations.
2. CSC SPV is a private sector initiative to promote digital literacy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSCs are designed to deliver services to rural citizens in India.  While they may serve some urban populations, their primary focus and reach are in rural areas. The program aims to bridge the digital divide and bring government and private sector services to underserved communities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CSC SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) is set up by the Ministry of Electronics & IT, not a private sector initiative. It's a government-led entity overseeing the implementation of the CSC scheme.  The initiative is a government program, not a private undertaking.  The government’s role is central to the CSC framework.


**18. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI is released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
2.  The WPFI ranks countries based solely on the number of journalists killed each year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI is released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not UNESCO.  RSF is an independent NGO dedicated to defending and promoting press freedom globally.  The index is a product of RSF’s research and analysis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPFI considers a broader range of factors than just the number of journalists killed.  It assesses various aspects affecting press freedom, including legal frameworks, political pressure, violence against journalists, and the overall media environment.  The ranking incorporates a multi-faceted assessment of press freedom.


**1. With reference to Cantonment Boards in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for administering exclusively military areas, established through executive orders.
2. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the administration of Cantonment Boards, aligning with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Cantonments do house military troops, they also comprise civilian populations.  A military station, in contrast, is exclusively for military personnel. Cantonments were initially established by the East India Company and their administration falls under the Union Government.

Statement 2 is correct. The Cantonments Act, 2006, is the primary legislation governing the administration of Cantonment Boards.  Its alignment with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies, reflects the civic responsibilities these boards undertake, such as providing public health, water supply, and primary education.  The Station Commander acts as the ex-officio President of the Board, highlighting the military's administrative oversight, but doesn't negate the legal framework of the Cantonments Act, 2006.


**2. With reference to the Supreme Court's interpretation of fundamental rights concerning environmental issues, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supreme Court has ruled that the right to a pollution-free environment is explicitly mentioned under Article 21 (Right to Life) of the Constitution.
2.  In a recent judgment, the Supreme Court broadened the scope of Articles 14 (Right to Equality) and 21 to include the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court has consistently interpreted Article 21 broadly to encompass the right to a healthy environment, including the right to a pollution-free environment, it's not explicitly *mentioned* in the article's text.  The court has judicially evolved this right through various landmark judgments.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supreme Court, in the case of *M.K. Ranjitsinh and Others v. Union of India and Others*, explicitly linked Articles 14 and 21 to the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change. This ruling demonstrates the judiciary's proactive role in expanding the scope of fundamental rights to address contemporary environmental challenges.  The court's use of judicial review to interpret existing articles in light of new realities is a crucial aspect of India's constitutional framework.


**3. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Finance Commission's recommendations determine the vertical devolution of funds, which currently allocates 51% of the divisible pool to the states.
2. Horizontal devolution among states considers factors like population (2011 census) and income distance, with equal weightage given to all criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Finance Commission does indeed determine the vertical devolution of funds, the current allocation to states is 41%, not 51%, of the divisible pool. This percentage can change with each Finance Commission's recommendations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While population (2011 census) and income distance are factors considered in horizontal devolution, the 15th Finance Commission did *not* give equal weightage to all criteria.  Different weights were assigned to various factors, including area, demographic performance, forest and ecology, and tax and fiscal efforts.  The unequal weightage reflects the complex considerations involved in resource allocation among states.


**4. With reference to the Special Category Status (SCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The constitutional provision for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly mentioned in Article 370.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS, replacing it with a need-based special funding pattern.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. There is no explicit constitutional provision for granting Special Category Status. While various Articles (like those under Article 371) provide special provisions for certain states,  SCS was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.  Article 370, which dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, is distinct and was repealed.

Statement 2 is correct. The 14th Finance Commission recommended phasing out the SCS. While special funding continues for some states (particularly in the Northeast and Himalayan regions), it's now based on need and other criteria, as opposed to the earlier SCS framework. This change was intended to create a more equitable and transparent system of resource allocation.


**5. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule empowers the President to establish Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) and Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
2.  ADCs and ARCs have the power to legislate on matters such as land revenue collection but not on matters related to forest management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the *Governor*, not the President, to establish ADCs and ARCs in the specified states.  The Governor's role reflects the decentralization of power intended by the Schedule.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ADCs and ARCs possess significant legislative and executive powers, including the authority to make laws on forest management, agriculture, inheritance, marriage, social customs, land revenue collection, taxation, trade regulation, and mineral royalty collection.  These powers are intended to enable greater tribal self-governance.


**6. With reference to the procedure for the formation of new states in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Parliament can create a new state through a simple resolution passed by a majority vote in either house.
2. Before recommending a bill affecting a state’s boundaries, the President must consult the legislature of the affected state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The formation of new states requires a law passed by Parliament, not a simple resolution.  Article 3 explicitly mandates that such a law be introduced only on the President's recommendation.  A simple majority is sufficient for the passage of the bill, but the process is still a legislative one, not a mere resolution.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 3 mandates that the President must consult the legislature of the affected state before recommending a bill affecting its area, boundaries, or name.  This consultation is a crucial safeguard to ensure that the interests of the affected state are considered before any changes are made.


**7. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC Chairperson and members are appointed by the Lok Sabha Speaker for a term of five years.
2. The NHRC possesses the powers of a civil court, including the power to summon and examine witnesses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Chairperson and members of the NHRC are appointed by the President of India, not the Lok Sabha Speaker, based on the recommendations of a committee headed by the Prime Minister.  The term is three years or until the age of seventy, whichever is earlier.

Statement 2 is correct.  The NHRC is granted extensive powers under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, including the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  This includes summoning and examining witnesses, discovery and production of documents, and other powers necessary to conduct investigations effectively.


**8. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was enacted to ensure transparency and accountability in government.
2. The Supreme Court case, 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government,' established the right to information as a fundamental right under Article 32 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, indeed replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was considered inadequate in providing effective access to information.  The 2005 Act strengthened the provisions and broadened the scope of access to information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court case, 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government,' did significantly contribute to the recognition of the right to information, it did *not* establish it as a fundamental right under Article 32.  Article 32 pertains to the enforcement of fundamental rights, not the establishment of a new one.  The right to information is considered a fundamental right under Article 19 (freedom of speech and expression),  as interpreted by the courts.


**9. With reference to the Protected and Restricted Areas under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, consider the following statements:**

1.  Sikkim is entirely designated as a Protected Area under the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963.
2.  A foreigner, except a citizen of Bhutan, requires a special permit to enter a Protected or Restricted Area, irrespective of the purpose of their visit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sikkim is *partially* designated as a Protected Area and partially as a Restricted Area.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, does not designate the entire state as one or the other.  The division reflects the varied geographical and security considerations within the state.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While a special permit is generally required for foreigners (except Bhutanese citizens) to enter Protected or Restricted Areas, the requirement is subject to exceptions.  If there are extraordinary reasons justifying the visit, the government can grant permission without the need for a special permit.  This exception demonstrates that the regulations are not absolute.



**1. With reference to India's fiscal federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission recommended a 41% share of the divisible pool for states, marking a significant increase from the previous commission's allocation.
2.  Horizontal devolution, as determined by the 15th Finance Commission, prioritized Income Distance as the most heavily weighted criterion, followed by Area and Population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 15th Finance Commission did recommend a 41% share of the divisible pool for states; however,  the statement implies this was a *significant increase*.  While it might be compared to previous commissions, the statement lacks the necessary context to definitively call it a "significant increase."  The percentage itself is a factual point, but the assessment of its significance is subjective and requires additional data for verification.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Income Distance was a significant factor in the 15th Finance Commission's horizontal devolution formula, it was not the *most* heavily weighted criterion.  The most heavily weighted criterion was Income Distance (45%), followed by Area (15%), Population (15%), Demographic performance (12.5%), Forest and Ecology (10%), and Tax and fiscal efforts (2.5%). The statement incorrectly implies a different ordering of these criteria.  Therefore, only the fact about the weight of Income Distance is correct, and the rest is incorrect.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category Status (SCS) in India:**

1.  The constitutional basis for granting Special Category Status to states is explicitly defined in Articles 371 to 371-J.
2.  Following the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations, the system of granting Special Category Status was abolished, and the funding pattern for Northeastern and Himalayan states shifted to a different basis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* explicitly provide for Special Category Status (SCS).  While Articles 371 to 371-J offer special provisions to certain states, these are distinct from the concept of SCS, which was a policy decision, not a constitutional mandate.  The statement incorrectly equates the special provisions under these articles with the constitutional basis for SCS.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of the SCS.  The subsequent funding pattern for states like those in the Northeast and Himalayas was based on different criteria, as stated in the passage,  often determined by Sub-Groups of Chief Ministers and not linked to the former SCS designation.  This accurately reflects the shift in the approach to special funding for these regions.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule, enacted under Article 244(2), allows for the establishment of Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) but not Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs).
2.  ADCs established under the Sixth Schedule possess extensive powers, including legislative, executive, and judicial authority, over matters such as land revenue collection and forest management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), empowers the Governor to create both Autonomous District Councils (ADCs) *and* Autonomous Regional Councils (ARCs). The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the Schedule's provisions to only ADCs.

Statement 2 is correct.  ADCs under the Sixth Schedule are granted significant autonomy. They have the power to make laws on specified subjects, including forest management, land revenue collection, and regulation of trade. They also possess executive and judicial powers within their jurisdiction.  The statement accurately describes the extensive powers vested in these councils.


**4.  With reference to the powers of the Union and State Governments concerning borrowing, consider the following statements:**

1.  Under Article 293, State governments can borrow money both within and outside India.
2.  If a state government is indebted to the Union government, it requires the Union's prior consent before undertaking any further borrowing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Article 293 explicitly restricts state governments' borrowing to *within* India. They are not permitted to borrow from foreign sources. The statement incorrectly expands the scope of this article to include foreign borrowing.

Statement 2 is correct.  Article 292, while granting the Union government the power to borrow both domestically and internationally, implicitly establishes a restriction on states.  If a state owes money to the Union, it cannot take on further debt without the Union's prior approval. This prevents states from accumulating excessive debt and ensures fiscal responsibility within the federal framework.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the status of state finances in India:**

1.  States in India currently generate sufficient revenue from their own sources to cover at least 75% of their revenue expenditure.
2.  As of March 2023, the debt-to-GDP ratio for states in India exceeded 30%.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text indicates that states only cover 58% of their revenue expenditure through their own revenue sources. The statement significantly overestimates this figure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The debt-to-GDP ratio for states in India, as of March 2023, was 27.5%, not exceeding 30% as the statement claims.  While the statement is close to the actual figure, the difference makes it factually incorrect in the context of a precise numerical value.


**1. With reference to Protected and Restricted Areas in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim are entirely designated as Protected Areas under the Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958.
2.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, mandates that all foreigners, irrespective of nationality, require special permits to enter Restricted Areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Arunachal Pradesh is entirely a Protected Area, Sikkim is only partially designated as such; a portion falls under Restricted Areas.  The Foreigners (Protected Areas) Order, 1958, governs Protected Areas, while the Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, governs Restricted Areas.  The two orders operate separately and define different categories of access restrictions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Foreigners (Restricted Areas) Order, 1963, does stipulate special permit requirements for foreigners entering Restricted Areas. However, it explicitly exempts Bhutanese citizens from this requirement.  The statement incorrectly presents this as a universal rule for all foreigners. The key distinction lies in the specific legal frameworks and the exceptions they contain.  Understanding the nuances of these regulations is crucial for comprehending India's border management and foreign access policies.


**2. With reference to India's Fiscal Federalism, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 15th Finance Commission's devolution formula allocates 41% of the divisible pool to states, primarily based on population size and geographical area.
2.  Article 293 of the Indian Constitution empowers state governments to borrow money both within and outside India, subject to the approval of the Union Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 15th Finance Commission did allocate 41% of the divisible pool to states, its formula isn't solely based on population and area.  Several other factors, including income distance, demographic performance, forest cover, and tax efforts, are weighted into the distribution. The statement oversimplifies a complex formula, neglecting crucial elements that significantly impact the allocation process.  A comprehensive understanding of the 15th Finance Commission's recommendations requires an awareness of the multiple criteria and their relative weights.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Article 293 of the Indian Constitution restricts state governments from borrowing outside India. They can only borrow within the country.  The statement wrongly attributes unrestricted borrowing powers to states, both domestically and internationally. This oversight reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of India's constitutional framework governing state finances.  The limitations on state borrowing are designed to maintain fiscal stability and prevent unsustainable debt accumulation.


**3. With reference to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CBI Director's appointment is solely determined by the Prime Minister of India, reflecting the executive branch's dominance over investigative agencies.
2. The CBI is a constitutional body established under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, ensuring its independence and accountability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Prime Minister plays a significant role in the selection process of the CBI Director, it's not a solely executive decision.  A panel comprising the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Chief Justice of India collectively selects the Director.  This collaborative approach aims to ensure a degree of impartiality and prevent undue political influence. The statement ignores the crucial role of other stakeholders in the appointment process, misrepresenting the reality of power dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CBI is not a constitutional body; it's a statutory body established under the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946. Article 32 deals with the right to constitutional remedies, not the establishment of investigative agencies.  Confusing the CBI's legal basis with constitutional provisions undermines an understanding of its legal standing and accountability mechanisms. The distinction between statutory and constitutional bodies is fundamental to understanding the Indian governance structure.


**4. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, expanding the scope of citizen access to information.
2.  The RTI Act guarantees access to all information held by any individual, whether a public authority or private citizen, to ensure complete transparency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, significantly broadening the scope of information access for citizens and strengthening transparency mechanisms.  The earlier act was considered inadequate, and the 2005 act was a major reform.  Understanding this timeline is important in analyzing the evolution of India's transparency and accountability framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RTI Act's scope is limited to information held by public authorities. It does not extend to information held by private individuals.  The statement overstates the reach of the RTI Act, potentially leading to misconceptions about its applicability and limitations.  Distinguishing between public and private information is crucial in applying the RTI Act correctly.  The statement misrepresents a key limitation of the act.


**5. With reference to the President's powers regarding mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President of India can grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute death sentences only for offenses under the Indian Penal Code (IPC).
2.  Article 72 of the Constitution exclusively grants the President the power to commute death sentences, while pardons for other offenses fall under the purview of state governors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or commute sentences extends beyond offenses solely under the IPC. It encompasses offenses under any law to which the executive power of the Union extends, including those dealt with by court-martial. The statement incorrectly restricts the President's powers to a specific set of laws, demonstrating a lack of understanding of the breadth of Article 72.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Article 72 grants the President power over pardons, reprieves, respites, and the commutation of sentences, including death sentences.  The statement wrongly assigns the commutation of death sentences exclusively to the President and other pardons to state governors. This shows a misunderstanding of the constitutional distribution of executive clemency powers.  Both the President and Governors have distinct but overlapping powers in this regard.


**6. With reference to the Inner Line Permit (ILP) system, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ILP system was introduced in the 19th century primarily to facilitate trade and commerce between India and neighboring countries.
2.  Currently, only citizens of India residing in the states where ILP is implemented are eligible to obtain an ILP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ILP system, originating from the Bengal Eastern Frontier Regulations of 1873, wasn't primarily designed to promote trade. Its main purpose was to regulate the movement of people into specific areas, largely to protect the tribal populations and their cultures.  The statement misrepresents the historical context and the original intent behind the implementation of the ILP system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Indian citizens are eligible for ILPs, certain categories of Indian citizens are not. NRIs, PIO card holders, and OCI holders are not eligible for ILPs and must apply for Protected/Restricted Area Permits.  This demonstrates a limited understanding of the eligibility criteria for ILPs.  The statement overlooks important exceptions within the system, leading to an incomplete picture.


**1. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and significantly broadened the scope of information accessible to the public.
2.  The Central Information Commission (CIC) has the power to impose penalties on Public Authorities for non-compliance with RTI requests, but it lacks the authority to initiate criminal proceedings.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RTI Act, 2005, superseded the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, which was considered inadequate in its scope and implementation. The 2005 Act significantly expanded the categories of information accessible to citizens and strengthened the mechanisms for enforcement.  It established a more robust framework for information access, including the creation of Central and State Information Commissions with greater powers.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The CIC and State Information Commissions (SICs) have the power to impose penalties on Public Authorities for various violations, including non-compliance with RTI requests, providing incomplete or incorrect information, and unreasonably delaying responses.  However, their powers are primarily administrative and quasi-judicial; they cannot directly initiate criminal proceedings against erring officials.  Criminal prosecution would fall under the purview of other legal mechanisms.  The emphasis here is on the administrative penalties the CIC can levy, a key aspect of the RTI Act's enforcement mechanism.


**2. With reference to the Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The DPDP Act establishes a Data Protection Board of India (DPBI) to oversee the implementation of the Act and address grievances related to data protection.
2.  The Act grants data principals the right to data portability, allowing them to transfer their personal data easily between different data fiduciaries.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The DPDP Act, 2023, establishes the DPBI as an independent body responsible for regulating the processing of digital personal data.  The DPBI is tasked with monitoring compliance, imposing penalties, directing data fiduciaries to take remedial actions in case of data breaches, and hearing grievances from data principals.  Its creation is a central feature of the Act's enforcement mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the DPDP Act grants data principals several rights, including the right to access, correction, and erasure of their data, it does *not* explicitly include the right to data portability.  Data portability, the ability to easily transfer one's data from one service provider to another, is a concept gaining traction in data protection laws globally, but it's not a feature of the current Indian DPDP Act.  The absence of this specific right is a key difference and represents a potential area for future amendments or clarifications.


**3.  With reference to the Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023 (Indian Criminal Justice Code), consider the following statements:**

1. The Code introduces provisions for the release of first-time offenders on bail after they have completed one-third of their maximum sentence.
2. The Code mandates forensic investigation for all offences, regardless of the severity of the punishment.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita, 2023, aims to streamline and improve the criminal justice system.  One significant aspect is the provision for the release on bail of first-time offenders who have served one-third of their maximum sentence. This is intended to reduce overcrowding in prisons and provide a pathway for rehabilitation.  Exceptions exist, of course, for serious offences such as those punishable by death or life imprisonment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Bharatiya Nyay Sanhita does *not* mandate forensic investigation for all offences.  While it emphasizes the importance of forensic science in criminal investigations, mandatory forensic investigation is typically limited to serious offences or those where such evidence is crucial for establishing guilt or innocence.  The Code likely provides for discretionary use of forensic tools based on the nature of the crime and the available resources.  Making it mandatory for all cases would be impractical and resource-intensive.


**4. With reference to the powers of the President of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  Article 72 of the Constitution empowers the President to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment only in cases where the sentence has been awarded by a court-martial.
2.  The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment extends to all offences against laws relating to matters to which the executive power of the Union extends.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Article 72 does allow the President to grant pardons, etc. in cases of court-martial sentences, it is not limited to such cases. The President’s power extends to a broader range of scenarios.

Statement 2 is correct. Article 72 explicitly grants the President the power to pardon, reprieve, respite, remit, or commute the punishment of any person convicted of any offense against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends.  This power is a significant aspect of the executive's role in the justice system and is often exercised in cases involving capital punishment or serious offences against the Union. The scope of this power is extensive, covering a vast array of offences falling under the Union's jurisdiction.


**5. With reference to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The NHRC is a constitutional body established under Part III of the Constitution of India, dealing with Fundamental Rights.
2. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations only on the basis of complaints received from individuals or organizations.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NHRC is a *statutory* body, not a constitutional body. It was established under the Protection of Human Rights Act, 1993, not directly through the Constitution itself. While its mandate is closely related to the fundamental rights guaranteed by Part III of the Constitution, it is not a constitutional body in the same way as, for example, the Election Commission.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NHRC can investigate human rights violations *suo moto* (on its own initiative) in addition to acting on complaints received.  This power allows the Commission to proactively address critical human rights issues even without waiting for formal complaints. The Commission has broad powers to investigate and make recommendations, and its suo moto power is an important aspect of its effectiveness.


**6. With reference to the Union Public Service Commission (UPSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPSC is responsible for conducting examinations for recruitment to all posts under the Union government, including those in the Indian Armed Forces.
2. The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President of India for a fixed term, and they can be removed only through impeachment by Parliament.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UPSC conducts examinations for most posts under the Union government, it does *not* conduct recruitment examinations for the Indian Armed Forces.  Recruitment to the Armed Forces follows a separate and distinct process.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chairman and members of the UPSC are appointed by the President, but they can be removed *before* the completion of their term under certain conditions.  While impeachment is a possibility for removal, it's not the only method.  The President can remove them on grounds of proven misbehavior or incapacity, following due process as prescribed by law.  The process is not necessarily equivalent to parliamentary impeachment.


**7. With reference to the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860, consider the following statements:**

1. The IPC, 1860, defines offences against the State, including those relating to waging war against the government and sedition.
2. The IPC, 1860, has not undergone any amendments since its enactment and remains largely unchanged in its original form.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IPC, 1860, contains provisions defining offences against the State, including those related to waging war against the government, sedition, and other acts aimed at undermining the authority of the State.  These provisions have been a subject of debate and legal challenges over the years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPC, 1860, has undergone numerous amendments since its enactment.  These amendments have reflected changing social norms, legal interpretations, and the need to address new forms of crime.  The Code has been modified to incorporate provisions relating to new offences and technologies, and to clarify existing provisions.  It is not static; it evolves to meet the changing needs of society and the criminal justice system.


**8. With reference to the Aadhaar card, consider the following statements:**

1. The Aadhaar card, issued by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI), serves as definitive proof of citizenship for all residents of India.
2. The 12-digit unique identification number in the Aadhaar card is linked to an individual's biometric data, ensuring uniqueness and preventing duplicate numbers.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Aadhaar card is a unique identification number, but it does *not* serve as definitive proof of citizenship.  Citizenship is determined through separate legal processes and documentation.  While the Aadhaar card can be used to establish identity for various purposes, it doesn't confer citizenship status.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Aadhaar card's 12-digit unique identification number is indeed linked to an individual's biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan). This linkage is intended to ensure that each individual has only one Aadhaar number and to prevent the creation of duplicate identities.  The biometric data is a crucial element in maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of the Aadhaar system.


**9. With reference to the Prevention of Black Marketing and Maintenance of Supplies of Essential Commodities Act (PBMSECA), 1980, consider the following statements:**

1. PBMSECA, 1980, is a preventive detention law that allows for the detention of individuals without trial for activities related to black marketing of essential commodities.
2. The Act empowers the government to regulate the production, distribution, and pricing of essential commodities to prevent hoarding and profiteering.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. PBMSECA, 1980, is indeed a preventive detention law. This means it allows for the detention of individuals without a formal trial if there is reason to believe they are involved in activities that threaten the availability of essential commodities.  The preventive detention aspect is a controversial feature of the Act.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Act aims to regulate the supply and distribution of essential commodities to prevent hoarding, black marketing, and profiteering.  The government has powers to control production, distribution channels, and pricing to ensure the availability of these commodities at fair prices to consumers.  This regulatory power is a key component of the Act's objective.  The Act is often invoked during times of scarcity or economic crisis.


**10. With reference to the  Curative Petition, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition is a remedy available to a litigant whose review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court of India.
2. A curative petition can be filed only on the grounds of violation of principles of natural justice or the judge's failure to disclose a conflict of interest.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant whose review petition (filed under Article 137 of the Constitution) has been dismissed by the Supreme Court. It's an extraordinary remedy, used only in exceptional circumstances when all other legal avenues have been exhausted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the grounds mentioned (violation of principles of natural justice and non-disclosure of conflict of interest) are often cited in curative petitions, they are not the *only* grounds.  Other exceptional circumstances that demonstrate a gross miscarriage of justice or a clear error of law may also justify filing a curative petition.  The Supreme Court exercises its discretion in determining the admissibility of curative petitions based on the specific facts and circumstances of each case.  The scope of grounds is broader than just those stated.


**1. With reference to the Jan Yojana Abhiyan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan, launched in 2018, aims to solely accelerate the participation of elected representatives in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).
2.  The campaign utilizes a thematic approach based on the localization of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), incorporating a ‘Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach.’

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (JYA) does aim to accelerate people's participation in PDP preparation, it's not limited to elected representatives.  The campaign actively involves elected representatives, government frontline workers, Community-Based Organizations (CBOs) like Self Help Groups (SHGs), and other stakeholders at all three tiers of Panchayats. The focus is on broad-based participation to ensure inclusivity and ownership of the development plans.

Statement 2 is correct.  The JYA employs a thematic approach directly linked to the localization of SDGs. This "Whole of Government and Whole of Society approach" ensures that various government agencies and societal actors collaborate to achieve development goals at the local level.  This holistic approach is crucial for effective implementation and achieving sustainable development outcomes.  The use of the Panchayat Development Index (PDI) further strengthens this approach by providing a framework for assessing development progress.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL):**

1.  iCAL, inaugurated in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the second such center in India aimed at setting global standards for auditing local governance bodies.
2.  iCAL primarily functions as a knowledge center and think tank, focusing solely on the development of auditing methodologies without direct involvement in capacity building initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is explicitly stated to be the *first* such center in India, aiming to establish global standards for auditing local governance bodies. The claim of a second center is factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While iCAL does function as a knowledge center and think tank addressing governance issues at the grassroots, its role extends significantly beyond just developing auditing methodologies.  It's also a collaborative platform for policymakers and auditors and serves as a center of excellence for capacity building of auditors.  This capacity building is essential for improving financial performance assessment and service delivery at the local level.


**3. With reference to the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005, consider the following statements:**

1. The RTI Act, 2005, replaced the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, and its coordinating agency is the Ministry of Home Affairs.
2. The Supreme Court case of 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government' established RTI as a fundamental right under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the RTI Act, 2005 did indeed replace the Freedom of Information Act, 2002, the coordinating agency is the Department of Personnel and Training under the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions (MoPPG&P), not the Ministry of Home Affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court case of 'Raj Narayan v/s Uttar Pradesh Government' did contribute to the recognition of the importance of access to information, but it did not explicitly establish RTI as a fundamental right under Article 21.  The RTI is a statutory right, not a fundamental right explicitly guaranteed under the Constitution.  While the right to information is connected to fundamental rights like freedom of speech and expression (Article 19), it's not directly derived from Article 21.


**4. With reference to the Public Examinations (Prevention of Unfair Means) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules mandate the immediate arrest and prosecution of any individual found to be involved in unfair means during public examinations, regardless of the severity of the offense.
2.  The rules stipulate the constitution of a committee by the public examination authority if there is involvement of the management or board of directors of a service provider in facilitating unfair means.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The rules do not mandate immediate arrest and prosecution for every instance of unfair means.  The rules empower the venue-in-charge to take appropriate action, *including* filing an FIR, if a prima facie case of unfair means or offense is reported. The decision to file an FIR and pursue prosecution depends on the assessment of the specific situation and the severity of the offense.

Statement 2 is correct. The rules clearly state that a committee will be constituted by the public examination authority if the management or board of directors of the service provider is involved in facilitating unfair means. This highlights the seriousness of such involvement and the need for a thorough investigation.


**5.  Consider the following statements regarding the Grievance Redressal Mechanism (GRM):**

1.  The Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) and the Central Vigilance Commission (CVC) are the two designated nodal agencies in the Union Government handling grievances.
2.  CPGRAMS is a 24x7 online platform connecting citizens with all Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and States, but excludes local bodies from its grievance redressal system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While DARPG (under MoPPG&P) is a designated nodal agency, the CVC is not.  The Directorate of Public Grievances, Cabinet Secretariat, is the other designated agency. The CVC focuses on anti-corruption measures, while DARPG and the Directorate of Public Grievances handle a broader range of citizen grievances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. CPGRAMS is indeed a 24x7 online platform connecting citizens with Ministries/Departments of the Government of India and States.  However, the statement incorrectly claims it excludes local bodies.  While the primary focus might be on central and state-level grievances, the system's architecture and potential for integration with local bodies cannot be definitively ruled out without further information. The statement presents an oversimplification.


**6. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments, NGOs are required to submit Aadhaar details of only the chairperson of the NGO for registration under the FCRA.
2.  The use of foreign funds is unrestricted, with NGOs allowed to utilize the entire foreign contribution received for any purpose they deem fit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate Aadhaar submission for *every* office-bearer of the NGO, not just the chairperson. This stringent requirement aims to enhance transparency and accountability in the handling of foreign funds.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2020 amendments significantly restricted the use of foreign funds.  A maximum of 20% (previously 50%) of the foreign contribution can be used for administrative expenses. The remaining funds must be used for the specific purpose for which they were received. This restriction aims to prevent misuse of funds and ensure they are utilized for the intended objectives.


**7.  With reference to the Post Office Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Director General of Postal Services (DGPS) the power to regulate matters such as charges for services and the sale of postage stamps, but not the power to intercept postal articles.
2. The Act introduces stringent penal provisions for various offenses, including misuse of postal services and unauthorized access to postal articles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Act does grant the DGPS the power to make regulations on matters such as charges for services and the supply and sale of postage stamps.  Importantly, it also grants the government the power to intercept postal articles under specific circumstances, such as for national security or public order.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act does *not* prescribe penal provisions.  This is a significant aspect differentiating it from previous legislation.  While the government retains powers to intercept mail under specific conditions, the lack of explicit penal provisions in the 2023 Act is a notable feature.


**8. Consider the following statements about Aadhaar:**

1. Aadhaar is a proof of citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared Aadhaar metadata could be stored indefinitely.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar is a proof of address and identity for residents of India, but it is *not* a proof of citizenship or domicile.  Citizenship and domicile are determined through separate legal processes and documentation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment explicitly stated that Aadhaar metadata cannot be stored for more than six months. This ruling emphasizes the importance of protecting the privacy of individuals' data and limiting the retention period of sensitive information.  The court's decision aimed to balance the benefits of Aadhaar with the need to safeguard fundamental rights.


**9. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes funded solely by the central government and implemented through state governments.
2. The current framework of CSSs is based on a report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, submitted in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CSSs are jointly funded by the central and state governments.  The central government provides a significant portion of the funding, but states also contribute, reflecting the shared responsibility in implementing these schemes.  The implementation happens through state governments, but it's a collaborative effort with central oversight.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework of CSSs is indeed based on the report by the Sub-Group of Chief Ministers on Rationalisation of CSSs, submitted in 2015. This report played a crucial role in shaping the structure and approach to centrally sponsored schemes.


**10. With reference to the Data Protection Board of India (DPBI), consider the following statements:**

1. The DPBI has the power to impose penalties but cannot direct data fiduciaries to take measures in the event of a data breach.  
2. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions are heard by the Supreme Court of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The DPBI does have the power to impose penalties *and* to direct data fiduciaries to take necessary measures in the event of a data breach. This is a crucial aspect of its role in ensuring data protection and accountability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Appeals against the DPBI's decisions lie with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT), not the Supreme Court of India.  This reflects the specialized nature of data protection issues and the expertise of TDSAT in resolving such disputes.


**1. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL is a collaborative platform exclusively for policymakers, designed to enhance the efficiency of local governance audits.
2.  iCAL's primary objective is to establish global benchmarks for auditing local governance bodies and strengthen the independence of local government auditors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because iCAL is a collaborative platform designed for both policymakers *and* auditors. Its purpose is not solely focused on policymakers but also includes capacity building for auditors.  The text explicitly states that it serves as a "centre of excellence for capacity building of auditors".  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies iCAL's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that iCAL aims to "set global standards for auditing local governance bodies" and that it "enhances independence of local government auditors".  These are the core aims of the initiative as described in the provided text.  The focus on global standards and auditor independence aligns directly with the statement's description.  Option (b) accurately reflects this core function.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992:**

1. These amendments introduced provisions for online audits of panchayat accounts, ensuring accountability in fund utilization.
2. The amendments primarily focus on establishing a framework for local self-governance, with provisions for the audit of local bodies delegated to the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Ministry of Panchayati Raj developed the AuditOnline application in 2020 to conduct online audits, this application is a *consequence* of the 73rd and 74th amendments, not a direct provision *within* them.  The amendments laid the groundwork for local self-governance, but the specific technological implementation of online audits came later.

Statement 2 is correct. The 73rd and 74th Constitutional Amendment Acts of 1992 fundamentally deal with establishing a three-tier panchayati raj system and urban local bodies respectively.  The audit mechanism, though indirectly impacted by these amendments, is not a primary focus in the amendments themselves.  The CAG's role in auditing local bodies stems from the CAG's (Duties, Powers and Conditions of Service) Act, 1971, and  is further elaborated upon by the 73rd and 74th amendments.  Therefore, the statement correctly identifies the amendments' core purpose regarding local self-governance and the subsequent involvement of the CAG.


**3. With reference to the Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSSs), consider the following statements:**

1. CSSs are schemes exclusively funded by the central government and implemented by state governments in sectors listed under the Union List of the Constitution.
2.  The current framework for CSSs is based on the recommendations of a 2015 report by a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers focused on rationalizing CSSs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSSs are *jointly* funded by the central and state governments, not solely by the central government.  The text clearly states that they are "funded jointly by centre and state".  The statement also incorrectly restricts the sectors to the Union List; CSSs operate in sectors falling under both the State and Concurrent Lists.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions that the "current framework of CSSs is based on report by Sub-Group of Chief Minsters on Rationalisation of CSSs (2015)". This directly supports the statement's claim regarding the origin of the current CSS framework.  The statement accurately reflects the source of the current CSS structure.


**4. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1. Aadhaar serves as definitive proof of both citizenship and domicile for residents of India.
2. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment declared the Aadhaar Act, 2016, unconstitutional, citing violations of fundamental rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Aadhaar is a proof of address and identity, but it is *not* proof of citizenship or domicile. The text explicitly clarifies this point.  The statement misrepresents the scope and legal standing of Aadhaar.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment *upheld* the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act, 2016, not declared it unconstitutional.  While the court did impose limitations on Aadhaar's use and data handling, it did not invalidate the Act itself. The statement directly contradicts the findings of the Supreme Court judgment as described in the text.


**5. With reference to the Foreign Contribution (Regulation) Act (FCRA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Post-2020 amendments to the FCRA mandate that all NGOs must obtain prior permission to receive foreign funds, regardless of their registration status.
2.  NGOs receiving foreign funds under the FCRA are permitted to utilize up to 50% of the funds for administrative expenses.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While post-2020 amendments to the FCRA do require prior permission and Aadhaar submission from office-bearers, it's not true that *all* NGOs need permission regardless of registration. The registration process itself is crucial for receiving foreign funds legally.  The statement oversimplifies the conditions for receiving foreign funds under the FCRA.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Post-2020 amendments have reduced the permissible limit for administrative expenses to 20%, not 50%.  The statement misrepresents a key provision of the amended FCRA.  The actual limit is significantly lower than what the statement claims.


**6.  Consider the following statements concerning the Special Category Status (SCS):**

1. The Constitution of India explicitly provides for the categorization of states as SCS states.
2.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the discontinuation of SCS grants, although special funding for certain states continues based on other criteria.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain any provision for classifying states as SCS states.  The SCS is a classification granted by the central government based on various factors, not a constitutional provision. The statement wrongly attributes a constitutional basis to the SCS designation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly indicates that the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations resulted in the end of the SCS system, and current special funding is based on different recommendations, not on the former SCS status.  The statement accurately reflects the evolution of special funding for certain states.


**7. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule was incorporated into the Constitution based on the recommendations of the Nehru Committee.
2. The Sixth Schedule aims to provide a framework for the administration of tribal areas in certain states, granting them a degree of autonomy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule was a result of the recommendations of the Bardoloi Committee, not the Nehru Committee.  The statement mistakenly attributes the origin of the Sixth Schedule to the wrong committee.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sixth Schedule, under Article 244(2), is designed to administer the tribal areas in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, providing them with a significant degree of self-governance.  The statement accurately captures the purpose and function of the Sixth Schedule.


**8. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI 2024 was released by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
2.  The index ranks countries based on a single indicator: the level of press freedom violations reported.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI 2024 is released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not UNESCO. The statement incorrectly identifies the organization responsible for publishing the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The WPFI uses multiple indicators (political, economic, legislative, social, and security) to assess press freedom, not just the number of reported violations. The statement oversimplifies the complex methodology used in creating the index.  The index is based on a multifaceted assessment of press freedom conditions, not a single metric.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding Special Category States (SCS):**

1.  The Constitution explicitly defines the criteria for categorizing a state as an SCS, outlining specific provisions for such states.
2.  The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the sole determinant of central grants to SCS states until the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Indian Constitution does *not* contain any explicit provision for categorizing a state as a Special Category State (SCS).  While numerous special provisions exist under Articles 371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J, offering a wide range of benefits to several states, there's no formal constitutional definition or criteria for SCS status.  The designation was largely a political decision based on factors like geographical location, economic backwardness, and strategic importance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was historically used for determining central grants to SCS states, it wasn't the *sole* determinant.  Other factors and considerations also influenced the allocation of funds. Moreover, the 14th Finance Commission's recommendations led to the phasing out of the SCS category itself, ending the application of the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula in that context.  Current special funding for Northeastern and Himalayan states is based on different recommendations, not their previous SCS status.  The assertion of sole determination is therefore factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to Special Financial Packages for States, consider the following statements:**

1.  Special financial packages are exclusively granted to states based on a demonstrable need assessed through rigorous objective criteria.
2.  The provision of special packages falls under Article 282 of the Constitution, which deals with discretionary grants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Special financial packages are *not* exclusively granted based on objectively assessed needs.  While need may be a factor, the granting of such packages is largely discretionary, meaning it's based on political and other considerations beyond a strict, quantifiable assessment of necessity.  There's no fixed set of criteria that automatically triggers the allocation of a special package.

Statement 2 is correct.  Special packages are indeed provided under Article 282 of the Constitution, which empowers the Centre and states to make grants for any public purpose, even if it falls outside their respective legislative competence. This article allows for flexibility in financial assistance, making it the constitutional basis for discretionary grants like special packages.


**3. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Sixth Schedule's provisions apply uniformly to all states in Northeast India, irrespective of their unique circumstances.
2.  The inclusion of new areas under the Sixth Schedule requires a constitutional amendment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Sixth Schedule's provisions do *not* apply uniformly across all Northeastern states. It's specifically designed to address the distinct administrative needs of certain tribal areas within specific states.  The application is selective, not universal across the Northeast. The Schedule's structure and implementation vary depending on the specific state and the unique characteristics of the areas covered under it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While amending the Sixth Schedule would require a constitutional amendment process, the *inclusion* of new areas under the existing schedule may *not* always necessitate a full-fledged constitutional amendment.  The process might involve other legislative or administrative actions depending on the specific nature of the proposed inclusion.  The statement oversimplifies a complex procedure.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Jan Yojana Abhiyan (People's Plan Campaign):**

1.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan focuses solely on Gram Panchayats, excluding the participation of Block and District Panchayats.
2.  The campaign's thematic approach involves the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Jan Yojana Abhiyan explicitly involves *all three tiers* of Panchayats – Gram, Block, and District – in the preparation of Panchayat Development Plans (PDPs).  The campaign aims for a comprehensive approach to planning, not limiting itself to the Gram Panchayat level.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Jan Yojana Abhiyan adopts a thematic approach that directly incorporates the localization of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This means tailoring the SDGs to suit the specific context and needs of the local areas and communities involved in the planning process.  The campaign emphasizes a "Whole of Government and Whole of Society" approach to achieve this.


**5. With reference to the auditing of local bodies, consider the following statements:**

1.  The International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL) in Rajkot, Gujarat, is the first such institution globally.
2.  The primary focus of iCAL is to develop standardized auditing practices exclusively for Indian local bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  iCAL is the first such center in *India*, not globally. Many other international organizations and institutions already focus on auditing and governance issues at the local level. While iCAL is a significant development for India, it's not a pioneering initiative in the global context.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While iCAL aims to set standards for auditing local governance bodies, its focus is not *exclusively* on Indian local bodies. The center's goal is to contribute to the development of global best practices and standards in this area, thereby influencing auditing practices beyond India's borders.  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of iCAL's objectives.


**6. With reference to Aadhaar, consider the following statements:**

1.  Aadhaar's random number generation system incorporates demographic details like caste, religion, and income for improved data accuracy.
2.  The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment mandated Aadhaar's use for all private transactions, including opening bank accounts and mobile connections.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Aadhaar's random number generation system is explicitly designed *not* to include demographic details such as caste, religion, and income.  This is a key feature of the system to protect individual privacy and prevent potential discrimination. The system's uniqueness comes from its biometric linking, not from demographic data inclusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's 2018 judgment affirmed the constitutionality of the Aadhaar Act but did *not* mandate its use for all private transactions.  While Aadhaar is required for accessing certain government welfare schemes, the Court explicitly stated that it cannot be forced for activities like opening bank accounts or obtaining mobile and internet connections.  The statement misrepresents the Court's decision.


**7. With reference to Centrally Sponsored Schemes (CSS), consider the following statements:**

1.  CSS are exclusively implemented by the central government, with states playing only a passive role.
2.  The current framework of CSS is based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers formed in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  CSS are *jointly* funded and implemented by the central and state governments.  States play an active role in implementing these schemes within their respective jurisdictions. The central government provides the financial support and guidelines, but states are responsible for the on-ground execution and management of the schemes. The statement incorrectly portrays a unilateral central government role.

Statement 2 is correct. The current framework governing CSS is indeed based on the recommendations of a Sub-Group of Chief Ministers which was established in 2015 to rationalize these schemes. This Sub-Group's report significantly shaped the current structure and operational guidelines of CSS.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the President's power on mercy petitions:**

1.  The President's power under Article 72 extends to all sentences, regardless of the nature of the crime or the court that imposed the sentence.
2.  The President's decision on a mercy petition is not subject to judicial review.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The President's power under Article 72 is *not* unlimited.  It specifically applies to pardons, reprieves, respites, remissions, and commutations of sentences in certain cases: those by court-martial, for offenses under Union laws, and death sentences.  The President's power does not extend to all sentences in all circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's decision on a mercy petition carries significant weight, it is *not* entirely immune to judicial review.  The courts can intervene if there are significant procedural irregularities or if the decision is demonstrably arbitrary or mala fide.  The statement wrongly suggests absolute immunity from judicial scrutiny.


**9. With reference to Curative Petitions, consider the following statements:**

1.  A curative petition can be filed only after a review petition has been rejected by the Supreme Court.
2.  The power of the Supreme Court to hear curative petitions is explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. A curative petition is the last resort available to a litigant after the Supreme Court rejects a review petition.  It is a mechanism to address exceptional situations where there are serious errors or irregularities that were overlooked in the earlier stages of the judicial process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Supreme Court's power to hear curative petitions stems from its inherent power under Article 142 (to do complete justice), the concept of curative petitions itself is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution.  The power is derived from the Court's inherent jurisdiction to ensure the proper administration of justice.  The statement misrepresents the constitutional basis of the Court's power.


**10. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1.  FTSCs were established as a State-sponsored scheme to expedite the disposal of cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act.
2.  FTSCs are exclusively funded by the State governments.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *Centrally sponsored* scheme, not a State-sponsored one.  While states are involved in their implementation, the primary funding and policy direction come from the central government.  The statement incorrectly attributes the sponsorship to the states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  FTSCs are primarily funded from the Nirbhaya Fund, which is a *Central* fund.  While states may contribute to their operational costs, the major source of funding is the central government's Nirbhaya Fund. The statement incorrectly attributes the funding solely to the state governments.


**11. With reference to Parliamentary Committees, consider the following statements:**

1. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) was first constituted in 1950.
2. The Estimates Committee examines the government's expenditure to ensure efficiency and value for money.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PAC was first established in 1921, not 1950.  Its origins predate Indian independence.  The statement provides an incorrect date for the PAC's establishment.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Estimates Committee's primary function is to scrutinize the government's budget and expenditure, suggesting ways to improve efficiency and ensure that public funds are utilized effectively and economically.  This is a core part of the Committee's mandate.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding the Parliamentary Committee on Official Languages (PCOL):**

1. PCOL was constituted in 1963 under the Official Languages Act, 1963.
2. PCOL's membership comprises only Members of Parliament from the Lok Sabha.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  PCOL was constituted in 1976, not 1963. The Official Languages Act, 1963, envisaged its formation 10 years after the Act's commencement, leading to its creation in 1976. The statement gives an inaccurate year for its establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. PCOL's membership includes Members of Parliament from both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha. The statement falsely restricts its membership solely to Lok Sabha members.


**13. With reference to the Assam Accord, 1985, consider the following statements:**

1. The Assam Accord granted citizenship to all those who had migrated to Assam from Bangladesh before 1971.
2. The Assam Accord provided a framework for the detection and deportation of illegal immigrants from Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Assam Accord did *not* grant citizenship to all migrants from Bangladesh before 1971. It conferred citizenship to those who had migrated from East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) to Assam between January 1, 1966, and March 24, 1971, upon completion of ten years from the date of detection as a foreigner.  The statement misrepresents the Accord's provisions regarding citizenship.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Assam Accord established a mechanism for the detection and deportation of illegal immigrants who entered Assam after March 24, 1971.  This was a crucial aspect of the Accord, aimed at addressing the issue of illegal immigration.


**14. With reference to the Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The rules allow for the application of citizenship by naturalization only to individuals of Indian origin.
2.  The rules mandate the submission of applications for citizenship through a specific online portal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Citizenship (Amendment) Rules, 2024, broaden the eligibility for citizenship by registration/naturalization beyond just individuals of Indian origin.  It includes various categories, such as those married to Indian citizens, minor children of Indian citizens, those whose parents are registered Indian citizens, and those who were citizens of independent India, etc. The statement incorrectly limits the eligibility criteria.

Statement 2 is correct.  The rules specify that applications for citizenship under Section 6B of the Citizenship Act, 1955, are to be submitted electronically to an Empowered Committee through a District Level Committee.  The statement accurately reflects the process for application submission.


**15.  Consider the following statements regarding Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cards:**

1. The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, expanded the grounds for cancellation of OCI registration.
2. Recent amendments have reclassified existing OCI cardholders as foreigners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Citizenship Amendment Act, 2019, indeed increased the number of grounds under which the central government can cancel OCI registration.  The Act provides five grounds for cancellation, expanding the government's power to revoke OCI status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  No recent amendments have reclassified existing OCI cardholders as foreigners.  Official statements from the Ministry of External Affairs have explicitly clarified that the existing OCI rules remain unchanged.  The statement is factually inaccurate and misleading.


**16. With reference to Gram Nyayalayas, consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas operate under the jurisdiction of the village head (Sarpanch).
2. Gram Nyayalayas are bound by the rules of evidence as laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* under the jurisdiction of the village head (Sarpanch). They operate independently as courts, with a Nyayadhikari appointed by the state government in consultation with the High Court. The statement incorrectly positions the village head as having authority over the courts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Gram Nyayalayas are *not* strictly bound by the rules of evidence under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  They are guided by the principles of natural justice and aim for a more informal and conciliatory approach to dispute resolution.  The statement misrepresents the legal framework governing these courts.


**17.  Consider the following statements regarding Contempt of Court:**

1.  Civil contempt involves willful disobedience of court orders, while criminal contempt involves actions that scandalize or lower the authority of a court.
2.  The power of High Courts to punish for contempt is derived from Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Civil contempt refers to the willful disobedience of court orders, decrees, or processes, while criminal contempt encompasses actions that scandalize, lower the authority of, or interfere with the administration of justice.  The statement correctly differentiates between the two types of contempt.

Statement 2 is correct. Articles 129 and 215 of the Constitution grant the Supreme Court and High Courts, respectively, the power to punish for contempt of court.  These articles provide the constitutional basis for the courts' inherent power to maintain their authority and ensure the proper administration of justice.


**18. With reference to the Right to Information Act (RTI), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RTI Act mandates that all information held by public authorities must be disclosed without exception.
2.  The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, enhanced the powers of Information Commissioners at the central and state levels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The RTI Act does *not* mandate the disclosure of *all* information held by public authorities without exception.  Certain categories of information are exempted from disclosure under Section 8 of the Act, including matters concerning national security,  and personal information.  The statement incorrectly presents an absolute right to information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The RTI (Amendment) Act, 2019, actually *reduced* the independence of Information Commissioners at the central and state levels.  It gave the central government more power to determine the terms and conditions of their employment, including salaries and allowances.  The statement wrongly claims an enhancement of their powers.




**1. Consider the following statements:**

1. Gram Nyayalayas, established under the Gram Nyayalayas Act, 2008, are exempted from the purview of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, but are bound by principles of natural justice.
2. The appointment of the Nyayadhikari for each Gram Nyayalaya is solely the prerogative of the state government, without any consultation with the High Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Gram Nyayalayas are indeed not bound by the strict rules of evidence laid down in the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  They operate under the principles of natural justice, ensuring fairness and impartiality in proceedings. This allows for a more flexible and accessible approach to dispute resolution at the village level.  The emphasis is on conciliation and speedy resolution of petty disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act explicitly states that the state government appoints the Nyayadhikari *in consultation with the High Court*. This collaborative approach ensures that the appointed individuals possess the necessary judicial expertise and uphold the standards of the judicial system. The High Court's involvement safeguards against potential biases and ensures the integrity of the Gram Nyayalaya's judicial processes.  The oversight by the High Court is a crucial element in maintaining the credibility and efficacy of the Gram Nyayalaya system.


**2. With reference to Contempt of Court, consider the following statements:**

1.  Civil contempt encompasses only the willful disobedience of court orders related to financial matters or property disputes.
2. Criminal contempt solely pertains to actions that directly obstruct the physical functioning of a court, such as occupying court premises illegally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Civil contempt is far broader than just financial or property disputes. It includes the willful disobedience of *any* judgment, decree, direction, order, writ, or process of a court, or a willful breach of an undertaking given to a court. This encompasses a wide range of actions and is not limited to financial or property matters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Criminal contempt includes actions that scandalize or lower the authority of any court, prejudice or interfere with the due course of any judicial proceeding, or interfere with or obstruct the administration of justice.  This is not limited to physical obstruction of court functioning but also encompasses actions that undermine the court's authority or integrity through publications or other means.


**3. With reference to Special Category States (SCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The constitutional basis for designating a state as an SCS is explicitly defined under Article 370 of the Indian Constitution.
2. The Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was the sole determinant for the allocation of funds to SCS, irrespective of other factors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Constitution does *not* contain any provision explicitly categorizing states as Special Category States.  While several articles (371, 371-A to 371-H, and 371-J) provide special provisions for certain states,  there's no single article defining the SCS designation. The categorization historically arose based on various factors like geographical location, economic backwardness, and strategic importance.  Article 370 specifically dealt with the special status of Jammu and Kashmir, which is distinct from the broader concept of SCS.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Gadgil-Mukherjee formula was a significant factor in determining central grants to SCS, it wasn't the *sole* determinant. Other factors, such as the state's specific needs and developmental priorities, also played a role in the allocation of funds.  The formula itself was subject to revisions and modifications over time, reflecting the evolving needs of the states concerned.  The 14th Finance Commission's recommendations effectively ended the SCS categorization and the associated funding pattern.


**4. With reference to the Sixth Schedule of the Indian Constitution, consider the following statements:**

1. The Sixth Schedule's provisions apply uniformly across all states in Northeast India, irrespective of their unique socio-political contexts.
2. The Bardoloi Committee's recommendations directly led to the inclusion of the Sixth Schedule in the Constitution, without any subsequent amendments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Sixth Schedule, while primarily applied in certain states of Northeast India, does not apply uniformly across all of them.  Its provisions are tailored to specific tribal areas within those states, reflecting the unique characteristics and needs of different communities.  The implementation and interpretation of the Sixth Schedule's provisions vary depending on the specific context of each region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Bardoloi Committee's recommendations were instrumental in the framing of the Sixth Schedule, it wasn't directly incorporated without subsequent modifications.  The Schedule has undergone amendments and interpretations over time to address evolving circumstances and challenges. The initial recommendations provided the foundation, but the final form of the Sixth Schedule reflects a process of refinement and adaptation to the realities on the ground.


**5. With reference to the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), 2019, consider the following statements:**

1. The CAA, 2019, amended the Citizenship Act of 1955 to grant citizenship to all refugees irrespective of their religious background.
2. The CAA, 2019, introduced a new category of citizenship specifically for individuals who have been residing in India for at least five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, does *not* grant citizenship to all refugees irrespective of religious background.  It specifically grants a pathway to Indian citizenship for religious minorities (Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian) who have fled persecution from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Afghanistan.  This is a religiously specific provision, and it does not encompass all refugees.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CAA, 2019, does not introduce a new category of citizenship.  It amends the existing provisions of the Citizenship Act of 1955, providing a special route to citizenship for the specified religious minorities who meet the eligibility criteria, including a residency requirement.  The Act does not create a wholly new citizenship category.


**6. With reference to the powers of the President of India regarding mercy petitions, consider the following statements:**

1. The President's power to grant pardon extends only to offenses committed against laws related to national security.
2. The President's decision on a mercy petition is not subject to judicial review by any court.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The President's power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites, or remissions of punishment, or to commute sentences, extends to a wider range of offenses than just those related to national security.  Article 72 empowers the President to act on sentences awarded by court-martial, or for offenses against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the Union extends, or in cases of death sentences.  The scope is not limited to national security offenses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the President's decision on a mercy petition carries significant weight, it is not entirely immune from judicial review.  The courts have, in certain instances, exercised their power of judicial review to examine the procedural aspects of the process or to address claims of violation of fundamental rights.  The President's decision is not absolute and can be subject to judicial scrutiny under specific circumstances.


**7. With reference to the Curative Petition, consider the following statements:**

1. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a writ petition by the Supreme Court.
2. The Supreme Court's power to entertain a curative petition stems directly from its inherent powers under Article 141 of the Constitution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A curative petition can be filed only after the dismissal of a review petition, not a writ petition, by the Supreme Court.  The review petition is a mechanism to reconsider a judgment already passed by the court.  A curative petition is a last resort, available only when all other avenues of appeal have been exhausted.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Supreme Court's power to entertain a curative petition is derived from Article 142, not Article 141, of the Constitution. Article 142 grants the Supreme Court the power to do complete justice, which includes the power to devise remedies not specifically provided for in other provisions of the Constitution.  The curative petition is a unique remedy that evolved through judicial interpretation to ensure that justice is done in exceptional cases.


**8. With reference to Fast-Track Special Courts (FTSCs), consider the following statements:**

1. FTSCs are exclusively funded by the state governments, with no central government contribution.
2. FTSCs primarily handle cases related to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act and cases involving offenses under the Indian Penal Code related to theft.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FTSCs are a *centrally sponsored scheme*, with the central government bearing the expenditure from the Nirbhaya Fund.  While state governments play a role in their implementation, the primary funding source is the central government.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While FTSCs primarily handle cases related to the POCSO Act and rape cases, they do not primarily handle theft cases under the Indian Penal Code.  Their focus is on expeditious disposal of cases involving serious sexual offenses against women and children.  The jurisdiction is specifically targeted at heinous crimes of sexual nature and not general crimes.


**9. With reference to Cantonment Boards, consider the following statements:**

1. Cantonment Boards are primarily responsible for the administration of military installations only.
2. The Cantonments Act, 2006, governs the functioning of Cantonment Boards, independent of the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Cantonment Boards administer areas that include both military and civilian populations. While the primary purpose of a cantonment is to house military troops, the administration extends to civic functions for both the military and civilian residents within the cantonment area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Cantonments Act, 2006, operates in accordance with the 74th Constitutional Amendment Act, which deals with urban local bodies. The Act aligns the administration of cantonments with the principles of local self-governance enshrined in the 74th Amendment.  The Act doesn't function in isolation but within the broader constitutional framework of local self-governance.


**10. With reference to the International Centre for Audit of Local Governance (iCAL), consider the following statements:**

1. iCAL's primary objective is to standardize auditing practices for local governance bodies across all states in India, ensuring uniformity.
2. iCAL functions independently of the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) and other existing audit mechanisms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While iCAL aims to set global standards for auditing local governance bodies, it doesn't necessarily enforce uniformity across all states.  The specific auditing practices may adapt to the unique needs and contexts of different states.  The goal is to improve the quality of audits, not to impose a rigid, uniform system across the nation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. iCAL works in conjunction with existing audit mechanisms, including those under the CAG. It acts as a center of excellence for capacity building and knowledge sharing, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of local government audits.  It does not function in isolation but seeks to complement and strengthen the existing frameworks.  The collaborative approach is crucial for successful implementation.
