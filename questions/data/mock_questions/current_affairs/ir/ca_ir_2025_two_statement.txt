(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GlobE focuses on anti-corruption efforts, it is not strictly a UN initiative. It's a network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities from various countries collaborating to enhance global cooperation in fighting corruption. The network works to improve information sharing, coordination, and capacity building.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the steering committee of the GlobE network was indeed announced in 2023. This highlights India's commitment to international anti-corruption efforts and its growing role in global governance.  India's participation in GlobE enhances international cooperation in combating corruption and promoting good governance.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses on diversifying critical supply chains to reduce reliance on single sources.
2.  The Crisis Response Network under IPEF aims to enhance the resilience of supply chains against geopolitical risks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement indeed aims to strengthen critical supply chains, encompassing both diversification efforts (statement 1) and resilience-building against disruptions (statement 2).  The Council focuses on practical measures to enhance the reliability and security of supply chains, while the Crisis Response Network provides a mechanism for collaborative action during emergencies.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both aspects are integral to the agreement's goals. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements accurately reflect the framework's objectives.  The IPEF's focus on supply chain resilience is a key element in its broader strategy of promoting economic security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing energy security cooperation between India, Middle Eastern countries, and European nations.
2.  One of the key objectives of IMEC is to improve connectivity and reduce transportation costs for goods and services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** While energy security is a relevant aspect of broader regional cooperation, the IMEC's primary focus is on improving connectivity and trade facilitation.  Statement 2 accurately reflects this core objective. The corridor aims to streamline transportation routes and reduce costs, thus boosting economic activity among participating nations. Statement 1 is an oversimplification; while energy is a component of trade, it's not the defining characteristic of the IMEC.  The corridor's scope is wider, encompassing various sectors and promoting overall economic integration. Therefore, option (b) is the most accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the IMEC's primary goal or fail to acknowledge the importance of improved connectivity.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's primary focus is on countering terrorism and promoting regional security, with economic cooperation as a secondary objective.
2.  The SCO's decision-making process requires consensus among all member states, leading to potential delays in implementing initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The SCO's mandate encompasses both security and economic cooperation. While counter-terrorism and regional security are prominent priorities (statement 1), the organization also actively promotes economic ties and development among its member states. The consensus-based decision-making mechanism (statement 2) is a characteristic of the SCO, which can sometimes lead to slower progress on certain initiatives compared to organizations with less stringent decision-making processes. Therefore, both statements are accurate reflections of the SCO's nature and function.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to account for both the security and economic dimensions of the SCO or the impact of its consensus-based decision-making.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 operates on a rotating presidency system, with each member state holding the presidency for a year and setting the agenda for that year.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative aimed at providing financial assistance to developing countries for infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The G7 indeed utilizes a rotating presidency system (statement 1), ensuring that each member state has the opportunity to shape the organization's agenda during its term.  The PGII (statement 2) is a significant G7 initiative designed to mobilize financial resources and support infrastructure development in developing countries. This initiative is a crucial aspect of the G7's efforts to promote global development and economic cooperation.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't fully capture the functional aspects of the G7, particularly its rotating presidency and the role of the PGII. The accuracy of both statements makes (c) the correct answer.


**5. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA's primary objective is to eliminate all tariffs on goods traded between ASEAN member states and India.
2.  India currently enjoys a significant trade surplus with the ASEAN region under the AITIGA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** AITIGA aims to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, trade barriers between India and ASEAN.  The agreement involves a phased approach to tariff reduction, and some tariffs remain.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Furthermore, India currently experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus. This makes statement 2 also incorrect.  The correct option is (d) because both statements misrepresent key aspects of AITIGA.  Understanding the nuances of the agreement's tariff reduction strategy and India's trade balance with ASEAN is crucial.


**6.  Consider the following statements regarding the SAARC Currency Swap Framework:**

1.  The SAARC Currency Swap Framework aims to facilitate cross-border transactions and reduce reliance on third-party currencies.
2.  Participation in the SAARC Currency Swap Framework is mandatory for all SAARC member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The SAARC Currency Swap Framework primarily aims to ease regional trade and financial transactions by reducing dependence on external currencies (statement 1).  However, participation is not mandatory for all SAARC members; it's based on voluntary participation and bilateral agreements.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.  Option (a) is correct because it accurately reflects the framework's core objective while acknowledging the non-mandatory nature of participation.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of either the framework's objective or the participation requirements.


**7. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s programs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear technologies to enhance agricultural productivity and improve crop yields.
2.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively focuses on tracking the illicit trafficking of nuclear weapons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The IAEA's Atoms4Food program indeed employs nuclear techniques to improve food security and agricultural practices (statement 1). This involves various applications, including pest control, crop improvement, and soil management. However, the ITDB monitors illicit trafficking of all nuclear materials, not just weapons (statement 2). It covers a broader range of nuclear materials and related activities.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct. Option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the scope of the Atoms4Food program or the ITDB's focus.


**8. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)'s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI assesses countries' cybersecurity capabilities based on a comprehensive framework encompassing various aspects of cybersecurity.
2.  A higher GCI score indicates a lower level of cybersecurity preparedness and resilience.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The ITU's GCI provides a comprehensive assessment of nations' cybersecurity postures, considering multiple factors (statement 1).  A higher GCI score signifies better cybersecurity preparedness and resilience, not a lower level (statement 2).  The index aims to benchmark countries' progress in building robust cybersecurity ecosystems.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misinterpret the meaning and purpose of the GCI scoring system.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF):**

1. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on combating piracy and maritime terrorism in the Indian Ocean region.
2. India's participation in the CMF is limited to providing logistical support and intelligence sharing, without direct involvement in combat operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The CMF is indeed a multinational naval partnership focused on maritime security, including counter-piracy and counter-terrorism operations (statement 1). While India provides intelligence and logistical support, its participation also includes direct operational involvement in CMF missions, such as Operation Crimson Barracuda (statement 2 is incorrect). India's active role goes beyond mere support, demonstrating a commitment to regional maritime security.  Therefore, option (a) is the most accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mischaracterization of India's role within the CMF.


**10. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, allowing them to arrest individuals without warrants and conduct searches without prior notice.
2.  AFSPA's application is permanent and cannot be revoked or modified even after significant improvements in the security situation in a given region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, including the authority to arrest and search without warrants (statement 1). However, AFSPA is not permanent; its application can be reviewed and modified, or even revoked, depending on the security situation in the designated area (statement 2 is incorrect).  The government can and has, in the past, extended or reduced the areas under AFSPA's jurisdiction. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the right answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misrepresentation of AFSPA's application and legal framework.


**11. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons by all states.
2. India is not a signatory to the CWC due to concerns about its impact on its domestic chemical industry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The CWC indeed prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons by all states (statement 1).  India is a signatory and party to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 (statement 2 is incorrect).  This demonstrates India's commitment to the treaty's objectives. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent India's stance on the CWC.


**12. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's MER assesses a country's effectiveness in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2.  A positive MER rating guarantees a country's immunity from international sanctions related to financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The FATF's MER does evaluate a country's efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing (statement 1).  However, a positive MER rating does not guarantee immunity from international sanctions.  Other factors and ongoing compliance are considered (statement 2 is incorrect). A positive MER is a step toward demonstrating commitment but not a complete shield against potential sanctions.  Thus, only statement 1 is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misinterpretation of the MER's significance and implications.


**13. With reference to the India-China border dispute, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated boundary agreed upon by both India and China.
2.  The Galwan Valley incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash between India and China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The LAC is not a formally demarcated boundary; it's an agreed-upon line of control, but not a formally defined border (statement 1 is incorrect).  The Galwan Valley clash of 2020 was indeed the deadliest incident since the 1962 war (statement 2 is correct).  This highlights the ongoing tensions and unresolved border disputes between the two countries. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent either the nature of the LAC or the significance of the Galwan Valley incident.


**14. Consider the following statements regarding India-Bangladesh relations:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh have established a comprehensive framework for cross-border electricity trade, ensuring seamless energy exchange.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia (statement 1 is correct). However, while India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, it's not necessarily the *largest* in Asia.  The framework for cross-border electricity trade between India and Bangladesh is developing but is not yet fully comprehensive, ensuring seamless energy exchange (statement 2 is incorrect).  Several projects are underway, but the system is not yet fully operational. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to mischaracterizations of either the trade relationship or the status of cross-border energy trade.


**15. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) allows for reciprocal access to military bases and logistical facilities between India and the US.
2.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been applied to India despite its defense purchases from Russia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** LEMOA does facilitate reciprocal access to military bases and logistical support between India and the US (statement 1 is correct). However, the US has warned India about potential CAATSA sanctions regarding defense purchases from Russia (statement 2 is incorrect). While an amendment was passed to exempt India in 2018, the threat remains.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to misinterpretations of either LEMOA or the implications of CAATSA for India.


**16. Consider the following statements regarding the  'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act':**

1. This US Act mandates that any resolution to the Tibet-China dispute must adhere to international law, including the UN Charter.
2. This Act imposes direct sanctions on China for its policies in Tibet.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The US Act,  'Promoting a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act', indeed emphasizes adherence to international law, including the UN Charter, in resolving the Tibet-China dispute (statement 1 is correct).  However, the Act does not directly impose sanctions on China; it focuses on promoting a legally sound resolution (statement 2 is incorrect).  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to misinterpretations of the Act's provisions and objectives.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybersecurity threats.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key Indian institutions involved in combating money laundering, established in 2004 and 1956 respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While cybersecurity is a growing concern related to financial crime, it's not explicitly a primary focus of the standard MER process.  The scope of the MER is primarily focused on traditional financial crimes and their related threats.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to combat money laundering and related crimes.  The ED, established in 1956, enforces economic laws and regulations, including those related to money laundering and foreign exchange violations.  Both are vital components of India's anti-money laundering framework.  The dates of establishment are accurate.


**2. With reference to the UNODC reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with the highest prevalence in the "Golden Triangle" region.
2.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, along with the Annual Report on World Drug Day, highlights the significant challenges posed by illicit drug trafficking and wildlife crime, particularly in regions like the "Death Crescent".

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally. The ranking of other drugs (opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy) is also generally accurate. While the report emphasizes multiple regions affected, the "Golden Triangle" (now often referred to as the "Death Triangle") remains a significant area for illicit drug production and trafficking.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The UNODC publishes both a World Drug Day report and a separate World Wildlife Crime Report.  These reports often highlight interconnectedness of transnational organized crime, including the links between drug trafficking and wildlife crime. The "Death Crescent" (formerly known as the "Golden Crescent") is a region highlighted for its involvement in the opium trade and related criminal activities.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect aspects of the UNODC's work.


**3. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INCB is a quasi-judicial body established under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term (2025-2030) signifies India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Serving on the INCB represents a significant role in shaping global drug control policies and monitoring compliance.  The specific dates mentioned are accurate.


**4. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative focuses solely on engaging youth in criminal justice reform through rehabilitation programs, while excluding crime prevention efforts.
2. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a key mechanism to tackle transnational organized crime, and India is a signatory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GenJust initiative does involve engaging youth in criminal justice, it's broader than just rehabilitation programs.  It aims to engage youth in both crime prevention and criminal justice, working towards a comprehensive approach.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNTOC, or Palermo Convention, is a significant international treaty designed to combat transnational organized crime.  It provides a framework for international cooperation and establishes mechanisms to address various forms of organized crime. India is indeed a signatory to the convention.


**5.  With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  GlobE's activities extend beyond information sharing.  It also involves capacity-building initiatives, training programs, and the development of best practices to enhance the effectiveness of anti-corruption law enforcement globally.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's participation in the GlobE steering committee demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.  Membership in such a committee provides a platform to influence global anti-corruption strategies and enhance international cooperation.


**6. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses solely on addressing supply chain disruptions caused by natural disasters, excluding other factors such as geopolitical instability.
2.  The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement established three bodies: the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board to enhance resilience and labor standards in regional supply chains.

While bilateral collaborations are expected to play a role, the initiative intends to leverage a multi-stakeholder approach, including multilateral development banks, private sector investments, and philanthropic contributions.  The statement's assertion about minimizing bureaucratic delays through direct bilateral oversight also oversimplifies the complexities of international development projects. Bureaucratic hurdles are a common challenge in such ventures, regardless of the funding model.  The PGII's success will depend on effectively coordinating diverse funding sources and navigating the inherent complexities of international collaborations.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the G7's initiatives:**

1. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is solely funded by the G7 nations, ensuring direct control over project implementation and minimizing the influence of external actors.
2. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) primarily focuses on promoting sustainable fishing practices and combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the G7 leads the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, it doesn't solely fund it. The initiative aims to *facilitate* access to external investment, suggesting a collaborative approach involving various funding sources, including private sector investments and other international organizations.  The assertion that G7 funding ensures direct control and minimizes external influence ignores the complexities of international development collaborations, where multiple stakeholders often play a role.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The G7 FSOI's scope is broader than solely focusing on sustainable fishing practices. Although combating IUU fishing is a crucial component, the initiative likely encompasses a wider range of ocean-related issues such as marine pollution, ocean conservation, and sustainable maritime transport.  To limit the initiative's focus to just sustainable fishing practices is a significant oversimplification of its likely comprehensive objectives. The FSOI's effectiveness will depend on engaging diverse stakeholders and addressing the multifaceted challenges facing the world's oceans.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF Supply Chain Council's primary mandate is to negotiate and finalize bilateral trade agreements between participating nations, aiming to reduce trade barriers and enhance market access.
2. The Crisis Response Network, established under the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement, focuses solely on developing disaster preparedness plans for individual participating nations, ensuring national-level resilience to supply chain disruptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IPEF Supply Chain Council's role is not primarily focused on negotiating bilateral trade agreements. While enhancing supply chain resilience might indirectly lead to improved trade, its core mandate is to *strengthen* critical supply chains through collaboration and coordination among participating nations.  Negotiating formal trade agreements is a separate process, typically handled through other channels.  The statement incorrectly conflates the Council's role with that of a traditional trade negotiation body.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF Crisis Response Network is not limited to national-level disaster preparedness.  Its focus is on *collective* emergency responses to supply chain disruptions. This implies collaborative efforts among participating nations to address crises affecting regional supply chains, rather than solely focusing on individual national plans.  The statement's limitation to national-level resilience overlooks the collaborative and regional aspects of the Network's mandate. The success of the network hinges on the ability of participating nations to cooperate and coordinate their responses to regional supply chain disruptions.


**4. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on developing new seaports and expanding existing port infrastructure along the proposed corridor to facilitate increased maritime trade.
2.  The IMEC's development is solely driven by government initiatives, with minimal involvement from the private sector or international organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While improved port infrastructure is likely a component of the IMEC, to say it is the *primary* focus is an oversimplification. The IMEC is envisioned as a comprehensive corridor encompassing various modes of transport and encompassing multiple economic activities beyond just maritime trade.  The statement inaccurately limits the scope of the IMEC to solely port development.  The corridor's success will depend on a holistic approach to infrastructure development and efficient connectivity across different modes of transport.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMEC's development is unlikely to be solely government-driven.  Such large-scale infrastructure projects typically involve significant private sector participation and often require collaboration with international organizations for funding and expertise. The statement's assertion of minimal private sector or international organization involvement is unrealistic for a project of this scale and complexity.  The IMEC's success will likely depend on effective public-private partnerships and engaging international stakeholders to leverage funding, expertise, and technology.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's cooperation program to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism focuses exclusively on military and security cooperation among member states, prioritizing joint military exercises and intelligence sharing.
2. Belarus's accession to the SCO significantly expands the organization's geographical reach into Eastern Europe, but has little impact on its economic or energy cooperation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While security cooperation is a significant aspect of the SCO's mandate, the program to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism is unlikely to be limited to military and security cooperation alone.  It likely incorporates multiple strategies, including diplomatic efforts, economic measures, and information sharing, alongside joint military exercises and intelligence sharing. The statement oversimplifies the multi-faceted nature of the SCO's counter-terrorism strategy.  Effectiveness requires a coordinated approach encompassing various domains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belarus's accession to the SCO does indeed expand its geographical reach, but to suggest it has little impact on economic or energy cooperation initiatives is inaccurate.  Belarus's inclusion brings new economic and energy dimensions to the SCO, potentially influencing trade routes, energy partnerships, and investment opportunities.  The statement underestimates the potential economic and energy implications of Belarus's membership. The expansion of the SCO's membership often leads to broader economic and energy cooperation opportunities among member states.


**1. With reference to the geographical features of Estonia, consider the following statements:**

1. Estonia shares land boundaries with four countries: Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Belarus.
2.  Estonia's maritime boundaries include the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga, and it is located in northeastern Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Estonia's land neighbours are indeed Russia to the east, Latvia to the north, Lithuania to the south, and Belarus to the southeast.  This forms a crucial geopolitical aspect of Estonia's position in Northern Europe.

Statement 2 is also correct.  Estonia is situated in northeastern Europe, and its maritime borders encompass the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga.  The Baltic Sea's strategic importance for trade and maritime security is well-established, making this a key geographical detail. The inclusion of the Gulf of Riga further specifies Estonia's maritime access.  Therefore, both statements accurately reflect Estonia's geographical characteristics.

2.  India's access to Sittwe Port enhances trade and transit opportunities for its northeastern region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that Sittwe Port is a *deep-water* port, not a shallow-water port. This is a significant distinction, as deep-water ports can accommodate larger vessels and handle greater cargo volumes.  The mischaracterization of the port's depth is a crucial error.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that Sittwe Port's operationalization by India will significantly improve trade and transit for India's northeastern states, providing a much-needed alternative route.  This is a vital aspect of India's strategic engagement in the region.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the significance of Sittwe Port.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Saint Martin’s Island is indeed in the Bay of Bengal, the text specifies it's located in the *northeastern* part, not southwestern. Furthermore, while there was a past agreement regarding sovereignty, the statement implies an ongoing dispute, which is not explicitly stated in the text.  The imprecise location and the inaccurate portrayal of the sovereignty status render this statement flawed.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage directly mentions reports claiming US intentions to establish a military base on the island. This reflects geopolitical dynamics and strategic considerations regarding the island's location. Therefore, only statement 2 aligns with the information provided.


**4. With reference to Guam Island, consider the following statements:**

1. Guam Island is the largest island in the Mariana Islands chain situated in the North Atlantic Ocean.
2.  The visit of INS Shivalik to Guam signifies India's growing naval presence in the Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Guam is indeed the largest and southernmost island in the Mariana Islands chain, the text specifies that it's situated in the *North Pacific Ocean*, not the North Atlantic Ocean.  This geographical error is significant.

Statement 2 is correct. INS Shivalik's visit to Guam underscores India's expanding naval reach and engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.  This demonstrates India's growing strategic presence and its participation in regional maritime security. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the significance of the event.


**5. With reference to the Seine River, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the Seine River is France's *second* longest river (after the Loire), not the longest.  It also clarifies that the river flows in a *northwesterly*, not southeasterly direction. These discrepancies significantly alter the statement's accuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Paris mayor performed a pre-Olympics swim in the Seine to demonstrate its cleanliness for the 2024 Games. This highlights environmental concerns and preparations for the event. Therefore, only statement 2 reflects the accurate information provided.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately places Lake Turkana in southwestern Kenya and northwestern Ethiopia, and correctly identifies it as the largest *permanent desert and alkaline* lake in the world (not just the largest permanent desert lake).  This is a precise geographical and ecological description.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the survey revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana.  This is a direct contradiction of the statement's claim.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.

1. China's major rivers include the Yangtze, Yellow, Mekong, and Irrawaddy rivers.
2. The Taklimakan Desert is China's largest desert and the world's largest desert.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The Yangtze and Yellow rivers are indeed major rivers in China. The Mekong River's source is in China, but a large part of it flows through other countries. The Irrawaddy River is primarily located in Myanmar.  The inclusion of the Irrawaddy is incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Taklimakan Desert is China's largest and the *second* largest in the world, not the largest.  This is a factual error. Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct, but given the options, (a) is the better choice.


**28. With reference to the India-Nepal border dispute, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-Nepal border dispute centers on the interpretation of the Treaty of Sugauli (1816), particularly regarding the origin of the Kali River.
2.  Nepal's recent decision to include Indian territories on its new currency note is unrelated to the ongoing border dispute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly explains that the dispute stems from differing interpretations of the Treaty of Sugauli (1816) and the source of the Kali River.  This is a direct and accurate explanation of the dispute's origin.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly links Nepal's decision to include Indian territories on its new currency note *directly* to the ongoing border dispute.  This directly contradicts the statement's claim of unrelatedness. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**29. With reference to Australia's geographical features, consider the following statements:**

1. The Murray River is Australia's longest river, and the Great Barrier Reef is located off its western coast.
2.  Australia is the flattest continent and has some of the world's oldest geological formations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Murray River is indeed Australia's longest river, the Great Barrier Reef is located off its *northeast* coast, not its western coast.  The incorrect location of the Great Barrier Reef makes this statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Australia as the flattest continent with some of the world's oldest geological formations.  This is an accurate description of Australia's geological characteristics.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**30. With reference to the India-Australia relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. India and Australia elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2022.
2.  The India-Australia Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement was signed in 2018.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly states that India and Australia upgraded their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2020.

**31. With reference to the India-Japan relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. India and Japan elevated their relationship to a "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" in 2014.
2.  The India-Japan Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) was signed in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the elevation of the India-Japan relationship to a "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" in 2014.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that the India-Japan CEPA was signed in 2011, not 2022. This is a factual error concerning the agreement's signing date. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**32. With reference to Japan's geographical features, consider the following statements:**

1. Japan's four main islands are Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu, with Honshu being the smallest.
2.  Japan is located in the Pacific Ocean and is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Honshu is the *largest* of Japan's four main islands, not the smallest. This is a factual error about the relative sizes of the islands.

Statement 2 is correct. The text implicitly indicates Japan's location in the Pacific Ocean and its susceptibility to seismic and volcanic activity. This is a widely understood fact about Japan's geography and geology.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.



**1. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, primarily focusing on maritime routes and port development.
2. The IMEC initiative is primarily driven by the Indian government's desire to reduce its dependence on traditional trade routes through Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is designed to improve connectivity and trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  A key component is enhancing maritime links and modernizing port infrastructure to facilitate efficient cargo movement.  This directly supports India's efforts to diversify its trade routes and reduce reliance on any single region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While reducing reliance on existing trade routes is a beneficial outcome of IMEC, it is not the primary driving force. The initiative's core objective is to create a more efficient, resilient, and diversified trade network, boosting economic growth for all participating regions.  The IMEC is about building new partnerships and strengthening existing ones, not solely about circumventing existing routes.  It is a broader strategic move aimed at increasing India's global economic influence and participation.


**2. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on counter-terrorism and regional security cooperation, with economic cooperation playing a secondary role.
2.  All SCO member states are permanent members of the UN Security Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the SCO engages in economic cooperation, its core mandate and primary focus remain on security issues, including counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism.  The organization's structure and initiatives heavily prioritize regional security and stability.  Economic cooperation is a significant aspect but is often viewed as supporting the overall security framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SCO has several members, but not all of them are permanent members of the UN Security Council.  The UN Security Council's permanent five (P5) are distinct from the SCO's membership.  The SCO's membership is geographically diverse and includes countries with varying levels of international influence and participation in UN bodies.


**3. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA has completely eliminated all trade barriers between India and ASEAN member states, resulting in a significant boost to bilateral trade.
2.  India consistently maintains a trade surplus with the ASEAN bloc due to AITIGA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers, but it hasn't entirely eliminated them.  Significant trade barriers still exist between India and some ASEAN member states.  The agreement is a process of gradual liberalization, not immediate and complete removal of all trade restrictions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India experiences a trade deficit with the ASEAN bloc. This means that India imports more goods from ASEAN countries than it exports to them.  While AITIGA has aimed to improve trade relations, it hasn't altered the fundamental trade imbalance.  Several factors influence this trade deficit, including differences in production costs, comparative advantages, and global market dynamics.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates with a permanent secretariat and a fixed agenda decided by its member states.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative focused solely on infrastructure development in African nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The G7 lacks a permanent secretariat. Its presidency rotates annually among its members, setting the agenda for each year. This rotating presidency ensures that different priorities and perspectives are addressed. There is no fixed, permanent structure beyond the annual summits.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PGII is a G7 initiative focusing on funding infrastructure projects in developing nations, it is not limited to Africa.  The initiative has a broader scope, encompassing numerous developing countries across various regions.  The G7 aims to support sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development globally.


**5. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. SAARC's decision-making process relies on consensus among all member states.
2. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement has completely harmonized trade regulations across all SAARC nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SAARC operates on a principle of consensus. Decisions require the unanimous agreement of all member states. This consensus-based approach can sometimes slow down decision-making but reflects the organization's commitment to inclusivity and the diverse interests of its members.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While SAFTA aims to reduce trade barriers and promote regional trade, it has not achieved complete harmonization of trade regulations across all SAARC nations.  Significant differences in national regulations and policies continue to impact regional trade flows.  The implementation of SAFTA has faced challenges due to various political and economic factors.


**6. With reference to the India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India maintains a consistent trade surplus with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
2. Remittances from the GCC countries constitute a significant portion of India's total inward remittances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India has a trade deficit with the GCC countries. This means that India imports more goods and services from GCC countries than it exports to them. This trade imbalance is a significant aspect of the bilateral economic relationship.

Statement 2 is correct.  Remittances from GCC countries are a substantial source of foreign exchange for India.  A significant portion of India's Non-Resident Indian (NRI) population resides in the GCC, and their remittances contribute considerably to India's economy and foreign exchange reserves.


**7. With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**

1. Ukraine is currently a full member of NATO.
2.  All NATO members contribute equally to the organization's funding based on a fixed percentage of their GDP.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ukraine is not currently a member of NATO.  It has applied for membership, but its accession is a complex process involving various political considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NATO's funding is based on contributions from all members, but these contributions are not equal.  They are determined by a formula considering each member's Gross National Income (GNI), with adjustments based on their economic capacity and military capabilities.  Therefore, there is a tiered system, not equal contributions.


**8. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear weapons theft.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative focuses solely on increasing agricultural yields through the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB tracks incidents of nuclear material theft, but this encompasses a broader range of materials beyond those directly related to nuclear weapons.  It includes various nuclear materials that could be used for illicit purposes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative does aim to improve global food security, its methods extend beyond GMOs. It utilizes a range of nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural practices, including soil analysis, pest control, and crop improvement.  It's a multifaceted approach, not solely reliant on GMO technology.


**9. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

2. The GCI categorizes countries into distinct tiers based on their overall cybersecurity capabilities, with Tier 1 representing the highest level of commitment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITU's GCI considers a broader range of cybersecurity commitments, encompassing government, private sector, and civil society initiatives.  A holistic approach is taken to understand a nation's overall cybersecurity posture.

Statement 2 is correct. The GCI uses a tiered system to categorize countries based on their cybersecurity capabilities and commitment.  Tier 1 signifies the highest level of commitment and effectiveness in cybersecurity, while lower tiers reflect varying levels of progress and challenges.  This tiered approach helps to benchmark and compare national cybersecurity efforts.


**10. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. India's participation in CMF is limited to providing logistical support and not direct operational involvement.
2.  The CMF solely focuses on combating piracy in the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation in CMF involves direct operational involvement, not just logistical support.  Indian naval assets actively participate in CMF operations, including counter-piracy and counter-terrorism efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While counter-piracy is a key aspect of CMF operations, its mandate is broader. The CMF also addresses various maritime security threats, such as terrorism, drug trafficking, and weapons smuggling.  Its operational area extends beyond the Indian Ocean region.


**1. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The Quad Health Security Partnership, established in 2021, includes South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand as permanent members.
2. The Quad's primary objective is to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region through military alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While South Korea, Vietnam, and New Zealand participated in the first virtual meeting of the Quad Health Security Partnership in 2021, forming the informal "Quad-Plus," they are not permanent members. The Quad itself consists of India, Japan, Australia, and the United States.  The Quad-Plus arrangement is ad-hoc and project-specific, not a formal expansion of the Quad's membership.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Quad's stated aims are broader than simply countering China.  While China's actions in the Indo-Pacific are a significant factor, the Quad focuses on promoting a free, open, inclusive, resilient, and healthy Indo-Pacific region. This includes upholding international law, freedom of navigation, and promoting democratic values.  The Quad is not a formal military alliance; its cooperation encompasses diplomatic, security, and public goods initiatives.


**2. With reference to the Vadhavan Port in Maharashtra, consider the following statements:**

1. The Vadhavan port is solely funded through public sector investment, reflecting the Indian government's commitment to infrastructure development.
2. The port's development is directly linked to the India-Middle East-Economic Corridor (IMEEEC) and the International North South Transportation Corridor (INSTC), enhancing regional connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Indian government is heavily involved in the Vadhavan port's development, it is explicitly mentioned that the project will leverage Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs). This signifies a combined public and private sector investment model, not solely public funding.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the Vadhavan port is an integral part of the IMEEEC, enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Further, it will facilitate EXIM trade flow through the IMEEEC and INSTC, demonstrating its direct linkage to these crucial transportation corridors.


**3. With reference to the International Solar Alliance (ISA), consider the following statements:**

1. Paraguay's recent membership brings the total number of ISA member countries to 119.
2. The ISA was jointly launched by India and France, with the primary aim of promoting the use of solar energy in only developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Paraguay became the 100th member, the total number of signatories to the ISA Framework Agreement is 119.  This means that while 100 countries are full members having ratified the agreement,  another 19 have signed but not yet fully joined.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although India and France jointly launched the ISA, its aim is not limited to developing countries. The ISA aims to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement through the rapid and massive deployment of solar energy globally.  While a focus is on assisting developing nations, membership is open to all countries.


**4. With reference to the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO), consider the following statements:**

1. The IHO is a specialized agency of the United Nations, primarily responsible for charting the world's navigable waters.
2. India's participation in the IHO dates back to 1955, with the Indian Naval Hydrographic Office playing a key role in national hydrographic surveys.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IHO is an intergovernmental organization, not a specialized agency of the United Nations.  It plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety of navigation and the protection of the marine environment through accurate surveying and charting of the world's waters, but it operates independently of the UN structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that India has been an active member of the IHO since 1955, and the Indian Naval Hydrographic Office (INHD) is the nodal agency for hydrographic surveys and nautical charting within India.


**5. With reference to the AUKUS agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. AUKUS is a formal military alliance similar to NATO, aimed at countering China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The agreement is for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal, but it does not imply exclusive Indian control.  The phrasing suggests a collaborative effort between India and Iran, not sole Indian control.  The agreement likely outlines shared responsibilities and benefits.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly highlights Chabahar Port's geostrategic importance due to its location on the Gulf of Oman.  It explicitly mentions that the port offers a direct sea route to Afghanistan, avoiding Pakistan, and serves as a gateway to Central Asia, connecting India to landlocked countries like Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan.  This aligns with the broader INSTC initiative.


**7. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multimodal transportation network established in 2000, connecting India, Iran, and Russia.
2. The INSTC primarily aims to reduce transportation costs and time between India and Europe by utilizing existing infrastructure and avoiding the Suez Canal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transportation network established in 2000 through an agreement signed by India, Iran, and Russia.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the INSTC aims to connect India with Russia and Europe, the assertion that it primarily aims to avoid the Suez Canal is an oversimplification. The INSTC aims to provide an alternative route, but not necessarily to completely avoid the Suez Canal.  The focus is on enhancing connectivity and providing a more efficient transportation network, potentially reducing costs and transit times but not necessarily eliminating the Suez Canal route entirely.


**8. With reference to the India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malaysia is currently India's third-largest trading partner within the ASEAN bloc and its 16th largest trading partner globally.
2.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Malaysia was signed in 2023 to enhance bilateral trade and economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text indicates that Malaysia is India's third-largest trading partner within ASEAN and its 16th largest globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CECA between India and Malaysia was signed in 2010, not 2023.  The text mentions the existence of the CECA, but the date given in the statement is inaccurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the timeline of the BIMSTEC charter's adoption and entry into force.  It was signed in 2022 and became effective in May 2024 after all member states completed ratification.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While security is one of BIMSTEC's seven focus areas, the charter's primary focus is not solely on military cooperation.  It encompasses a broader range of areas, including trade, environment, agriculture, people-to-people contact, science and technology, and connectivity.  The emphasis is on multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation, not exclusively military matters.


**10. With reference to the India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently enjoys a trade deficit with the United States, primarily due to the significant imports of defense equipment.
2.  The INDUS-X initiative, launched in June 2023, aims to promote partnerships between US and Indian defense companies, fostering collaboration in critical and emerging technologies.

2. The Quad Intra-Parliamentary Working Group was established to oversee the implementation of the Strengthening the Quad Act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Strengthening the Quad Act" aims to strengthen *cooperation* between the Quad members, not to create a new military alliance. The Act focuses on promoting a free and open Indo-Pacific, but doesn't involve establishing a formal military pact.  The Quad's cooperative nature remains unchanged.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the establishment of the Quad Intra-Parliamentary Working Group to facilitate progress on the initiatives outlined in the Strengthening the Quad Act and the newly formed Quad Working Groups.


**12. With reference to the SQUAD initiative, consider the following statements:**

1. SQUAD, launched in 2024, is a five-way security arrangement involving the US, Australia, the Philippines, Japan, and South Korea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text correctly identifies the MGC as an initiative launched by India and the five mentioned ASEAN countries. While cultural exchange is a component, the primary focus is broader than just tourism and includes economic cooperation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While cultural exchange is a part of the MGC, its primary focus is not limited to promoting cultural exchange and tourism. The MGC encompasses a wider range of cooperative endeavors, including economic and developmental projects.  Tourism is a secondary aspect, not the central objective.


**14. With reference to the India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCC is currently India's largest trading partner bloc, and India maintains a trade surplus with GCC countries.
2.  Over two-thirds of the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) population resides in GCC countries, contributing significantly to India's remittance inflows.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with GCC countries.  The statement incorrectly describes the trade balance.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately states that over two-thirds of the NRI population resides in GCC countries and that these countries contribute significantly to India's remittance inflows.  The statement accurately reflects the diaspora's distribution and its economic impact.


**15. With reference to the  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1. India became a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN in 1992 and a Summit-level Partner in 2012.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India began formal engagement with ASEAN in 1992, but it became a Dialogue Partner in 1996, not 1992, and a Summit-level Partner in 2002, not 2012.  The dates mentioned in the statement are inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ARF, while involving political and security issues, is not solely focused on military cooperation.  It's a platform for dialogue and cooperation on a broader range of political and security matters, not limited to military aspects.  The statement misrepresents the ARF's scope.


**1. With reference to Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Vijay primarily aimed to secure the Siachen Glacier from Pakistani incursions.
2. Operation Talwar involved the Indian Air Force's air strikes against Pakistani positions in the Kargil sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Vijay's objective was to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants who had infiltrated the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, not specifically the Siachen Glacier.  The Siachen Glacier conflict is a separate and long-standing issue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval operation launched by the Indian Navy to blockade Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea, not an air operation conducted by the Indian Air Force. Operation Safed Sagar was the air operation targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions during Operation Vijay.  Confusing the roles of the Air Force and Navy is a common distractor.  The key difference between naval and air operations, and their respective roles in the Kargil War, needs to be clearly understood.


**2. With reference to the Weaponization of Space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of any kind of military technology in space, including communication satellites.
2.  Militarization of space refers solely to the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty aims to prevent an arms race in outer space, it does not explicitly prohibit all military technology in space.  The treaty focuses primarily on weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and the placement of such weapons in orbit or on celestial bodies.  Many countries utilize space for various military purposes, including surveillance and communication, which are not explicitly prohibited by the treaty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Militarization of space encompasses a broader range of activities than just the deployment of WMDs.  It includes the use of space to support ground, sea, and air-based military operations, even without the direct deployment of weapons in space.  The distinction between weaponization (placing weapons in space) and militarization (using space for military purposes) is crucial.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB monitors and reports on incidents of illicit trafficking of *nuclear material*, which includes materials that can be used in both nuclear weapons and nuclear power.  The database doesn't limit its scope solely to nuclear weapons materials.  The distinction between different types of nuclear materials and their uses is a key element in understanding the IAEA's role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atoms4NetZero program specifically promotes the role of *nuclear energy* in achieving net-zero emissions, not renewable energy sources. The use of nuclear power as a low-carbon energy source is a controversial but important aspect of climate change mitigation strategies.


**4. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

2. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under the CMF, involved counter-piracy operations in the South China Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition that includes countries from various regions, not limited to those bordering the Indian Ocean. While many Indian Ocean Rim nations participate, membership is not geographically restricted.  Understanding the international nature of the CMF is essential.

Statement 2 is incorrect.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While AFSPA is applied to areas declared as "disturbed areas," this declaration is made by the central government, not solely the state government.  The power to declare an area "disturbed" resides with the central government, reflecting the Act's national security focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA grants broad powers to the armed forces, allowing them to arrest and detain individuals without warrants for a wider range of offenses than just those strictly related to national security.  The Act's powers extend beyond strict national security concerns and have been a subject of much debate and controversy.  The broad nature of the powers granted under AFSPA and the potential for misuse are key points of contention.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The BCBPI is not intended to replace the SWIFT system completely.  It aims to provide an alternative payment system for transactions *within* the BRICS nations, offering a choice rather than a complete replacement for the existing global system. The limited scope of the BCBPI's ambition is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The BCBPI leverages blockchain technology to enhance the speed and efficiency of cross-border payments among BRICS members.  Blockchain's potential for secure and transparent transactions is a key feature of the initiative.  Understanding the technological underpinnings of the BCBPI is important.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ARF includes not only ASEAN member states but also ASEAN Dialogue Partners, expanding its membership beyond the core ASEAN group.  The broader membership of the ARF reflects its role in regional security dialogue.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ARF's primary focus is on *political and security* issues in the Asia-Pacific region, not primarily economic cooperation.  While economic issues might be discussed, the ARF's mandate centers on security and diplomatic matters.  The distinction between the ARF's focus on security and other regional organizations focused on economic matters is important.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Neer provided *water* assistance to the Maldives during a water crisis, not medical assistance during a health crisis. The type of assistance provided during Operation Neer is a crucial detail.  Confusing the nature of the assistance provided is a common distractor.


**10. With reference to the BIMSTEC Charter, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force immediately after its signing in 2022.
2. The BIMSTEC Charter mandates the creation of a unified currency for all member states.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force only after *all* member states completed its ratification, which occurred later than its initial signing in 2022.  The process of ratification is a key element in understanding the Charter's implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter does not mandate the creation of a unified currency for its member states.  The Charter focuses on broader areas of cooperation, without specifying a unified currency.  The absence of a unified currency provision is a significant detail.


**11. With reference to the Quad, consider the following statements:**

The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, form the core of India's legal framework for tackling money laundering and terrorist financing. These acts provide the legal basis for investigations, prosecutions, and asset seizures related to these crimes.  The mention of specific years highlights the importance of understanding the temporal context of these legal instruments within the broader international anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing frameworks.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of the FATF and India's involvement. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are factually accurate.

While the statement emphasizes South Asia, GlobE's reach is global, making the regional emphasis an oversimplification but not entirely incorrect.

Statement 2 is also correct. GlobE's core function is to create a network for information exchange and coordinated action among anti-corruption agencies. This collaborative approach is crucial for effectively tackling corruption, which often transcends national borders.  Information sharing, joint investigations, and coordinated strategies are essential elements in combating transnational corruption networks and enhancing the effectiveness of anti-corruption measures.  Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Other options are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the functions and significance of GlobE and India's involvement.

It enables BIMSTEC to enter into agreements, pursue legal action, and engage in more formalized international relations, thereby strengthening its capacity for collective action. This strengthens the organization's legitimacy and its ability to address regional challenges more effectively.

Statement 2 is also correct. The BIMSTEC Charter is a foundational document that outlines the organization's core principles, goals, and structure. The mention of key principles such as sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and peaceful co-existence highlights the organization's commitment to maintaining a stable and cooperative regional environment. The dates (adoption in 2022 and entry into force in May 2024) provide important historical context.  Thus, both statements accurately describe important developments in BIMSTEC's evolution, making (c) the correct answer.  Other options are incorrect because they fail to fully represent the significance of the BIMSTEC Charter and the acquisition of legal personality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the core focus of FATF MERs is on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the assessment is not entirely separate from a country's broader financial regulatory environment. The effectiveness of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures is intrinsically linked to the overall financial regulatory framework.  The MER considers the interconnectedness of these elements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER process is a peer review, and its findings are not legally binding on the evaluated country.  However, the reports significantly influence a country's international reputation and its standing within the global financial system.  The recommendations made in the MER are influential but not legally enforceable.  A country's response to the recommendations is voluntary, though there can be significant pressure to implement them.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNODC report does indeed highlight cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally,  the statement misrepresents the geographic area with the highest rates of abuse.  The report identifies specific regions with high rates of drug abuse, but does not necessarily rank them in order of cannabis abuse alone. The statement mixes data from different parts of the report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC’s World Wildlife Crime Report addresses the issue of illegal wildlife trade globally and does not limit its focus to the "Triple Frontier Area". While the report highlights specific regions and their challenges, it provides a broader analysis of the global threat posed by wildlife trafficking and the involvement of organized crime. The statement restricts the scope of the report.


**5.  With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Posts, India, released commemorative postage stamps to mark the 150th anniversary of the UPU in 2024, coinciding with the 170th anniversary of India Post's formation.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. OPEC+ did agree to extend its output cuts, but the timeframe mentioned is incorrect.  The provided text states that the cuts were extended into 2025.  The decision was aimed at managing supply and influencing global oil prices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While OPEC+ decisions on production quotas are highly influential, they are not strictly binding on all member states. Member states have some degree of autonomy in their production levels, although significant deviations from agreed quotas can lead to considerable pressure and potential repercussions within the organization.  The statement overstates the binding nature of OPEC+ decisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIIB's mandate is broader than solely assisting high-income countries and renewable energy projects. While it does finance infrastructure projects, it targets a range of income levels, with a significant focus on developing countries and infrastructure projects that promote sustainable development. The statement incorrectly restricts the bank's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text explicitly states that the Union Finance Minister of India has requested the AIIB to focus on assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources for infrastructure development. This reflects India’s emphasis on inclusive development and supporting less developed nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Chemical Weapons Convention comprehensively bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons and includes stringent provisions for the destruction of existing stockpiles.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the convention.


**13. With reference to the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC has the authority to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but it does not have jurisdiction over crimes of aggression.
2.  The Rome Statute establishes the ICC as a court of last resort, meaning it can only exercise its jurisdiction if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute such crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC's jurisdiction extends to crimes of aggression, in addition to war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  The statement incorrectly limits the court's jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that the ICC is a court of last resort but it does not solely depend on the unwillingness or inability of national courts. The principle of complementarity means that the ICC will only intervene if national courts are genuinely unwilling or unable to prosecute.  The statement simplifies a complex legal principle.  The ICC can also act if national prosecutions are insufficient.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war, but it does not address their development, production, or stockpiling.  This limitation is a significant aspect of the protocol.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Geneva Protocol did not establish a formal verification mechanism or on-site inspection procedures.  Its enforcement relied primarily on states' adherence to the prohibition and international pressure. The absence of a robust verification mechanism is a key limitation of the protocol.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AFSPA grants the armed forces special powers, including the authority to arrest individuals without warrants and conduct searches without prior notice in designated areas.  These powers are controversial and subject to debate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA is not repealed in all of India; it remains in effect in certain areas, primarily in some parts of Jammu and Kashmir and the North-Eastern states. The statement is factually inaccurate regarding the scope of AFSPA's applicability.  The text itself only mentions its extension in parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GlobE does focus on anti-corruption efforts, its scope is broader than solely investigating and prosecuting financial crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN-GSCF addresses the disruptions caused by the mentioned factors, it emphasizes strengthening supply chain resilience, particularly for *Small Island Developing States (SIDS)*. The statement incorrectly focuses on developed countries.  The text explicitly mentions a focus on SIDS.


**26. With reference to the G4 nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The G4 nations are a group of four countries that have consistently supported each other's candidatures for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2. The meeting between the Minister of External Affairs of India and the foreign ministers of the G4 nations in New York focused solely on strategies for achieving permanent UNSC membership.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) have consistently supported each other's bids for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.  This mutual support is a key characteristic of the G4 initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While achieving permanent UNSC membership is a central theme for the G4 nations, the meeting likely encompassed a broader range of diplomatic discussions and international issues, beyond solely focusing on UNSC reform. The statement is too narrow in scope.  The text only mentions that the Minister of External Affairs met with foreign ministers of G4 nations.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is located in the northeastern part of Kenya and the southwestern part of Ethiopia.
2.  A recent UNESCO and World Food Programme survey revealed a significant decline in fish stocks in Lake Turkana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana is situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  The question plays on the directional aspects, subtly altering the location to appear plausible but incorrect.  The precise northwestern and southwestern placement is crucial for accurate geographical understanding, a skill often tested in UPSC exams.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The survey mentioned actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential. This statement uses a direct contradiction to mislead the candidate, exploiting common knowledge about overfishing and environmental degradation potentially affecting lake ecosystems.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of current events and environmental issues, and this question assesses awareness of a recent development related to Lake Turkana.  The use of organizations like UNESCO and WFP further emphasizes the international implications of the survey's findings.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a dormant stratovolcano located in Kenya.
2. It is considered the highest mountain in Africa and is part of a larger mountain range.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  While Kilimanjaro is indeed a dormant stratovolcano, it's located in Tanzania, not Kenya. This uses a geographically close but incorrect country to create a plausible distractor. The description of Kilimanjaro as a stratovolcano is a factual detail that requires specific knowledge, testing factual recall.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa, but it's a *free-standing* mountain, not part of a mountain range. This plays on the common misconception that all high mountains are part of extensive ranges.  The term "free-standing" is a key characteristic that differentiates Kilimanjaro, demonstrating whether the candidate possesses a nuanced understanding of geographical features.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is situated in the Sikkim region of India, close to the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal.
2.  Its closure during the Covid-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage route via Nepal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located in Uttarakhand (Pithorgarh district), not Sikkim. This uses a different Indian state to create confusion, testing knowledge of Indian geography and border areas. The placement of the pass at a tri-junction is a key geopolitical detail, hence important for UPSC.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the closure did impact the pilgrimage, the passage specifies that the route impacted was the one *through* Lipulekh Pass, not necessarily via Nepal. This subtle difference tests the candidate's ability to interpret and analyze information correctly.  The mention of the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage highlights the religious and cultural significance of the pass, an aspect frequently relevant in UPSC questions.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1.  Due to geopolitical instability, India has permanently shifted its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route.
2. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, forming a crucial trade route between Asia and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions a *shift* in fuel exports due to the Suez Canal, implying a temporary change in response to a specific event, not a permanent one. This tests understanding of nuanced language and avoiding assumptions based on incomplete information.  The mention of India's fuel exports highlights the economic and geopolitical implications of using the Suez Canal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This uses incorrect oceans to create a plausible but incorrect answer, testing detailed geographical knowledge. The description of the Suez Canal as a crucial trade route assesses knowledge of global trade and maritime routes, a frequently tested area in UPSC.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported a decrease in incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023 compared to previous years.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program focuses on utilizing nuclear technology to improve agricultural productivity and food security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the ITDB reported an *increase*, not a decrease, in incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023. This uses a direct opposite to create a misleading statement, testing factual recall. The mention of the ITDB highlights the IAEA's role in nuclear security and non-proliferation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions that the Atoms4Food program uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security. This statement tests knowledge of specific IAEA programs and their objectives.  This showcases the interdisciplinary link between nuclear science and food security, a key area in UPSC's examination of global challenges.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India is among the "role model" countries, indicating high performance, not low performance in cybersecurity. This uses a direct contradiction to create a misleading statement, testing factual understanding.  The mention of the GCI highlights the ITU's role in assessing global cybersecurity capabilities.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that the GCI assesses countries based on five cybersecurity pillars. This tests knowledge of the ITU's work in cybersecurity and its assessment methodology.  This demonstrates an understanding of the multifaceted nature of cybersecurity and the global efforts to address it.


**7. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Australia's 2024 National Defence Strategy identifies India as a 'second-tier' security partner in the Indo-Pacific region.
2.  The two countries have signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) to enhance economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that Australia's strategy identifies India as a 'top-tier' security partner.  This uses a lower ranking to create a misleading statement, testing factual recall and understanding of geopolitical dynamics. The mention of the Indo-Pacific region highlights the strategic importance of the India-Australia relationship.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that both countries signed an Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (which is essentially a CEPA) in 2022. This tests knowledge of specific agreements and their objectives between the two countries.  This demonstrates awareness of bilateral economic ties and their impact on regional cooperation.


**8. With reference to India-United Kingdom relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2022.
2.  Both countries collaborate extensively in the QUAD framework, alongside the US and Japan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the relationship was elevated to a CSP in 2021, not 2022. This uses an incorrect year to create a plausible distractor, testing knowledge of specific timelines in international relations. The mention of the CSP highlights the importance of the bilateral relationship.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions collaboration in the QUAD framework. This tests knowledge of multilateral partnerships involving India and the UK.  This demonstrates an understanding of regional and global alliances and their significance.


**9. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF was adopted in 2024.
2.  The MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text mentions India's MER was *first* adopted in 2010, and the 2024 plenary *adopted* the report, implying a review or update, not the initial adoption. This tests the ability to differentiate between initial adoption and subsequent reviews, a crucial skill in interpreting official reports. The mention of the FATF highlights the importance of international cooperation in combating financial crime.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly defines the MER's purpose as assessing measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and weapons proliferation. This tests knowledge of the FATF's functions and its assessment processes.  This demonstrates understanding of global efforts to combat financial crime and terrorism.


**10. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cocaine as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses solely on illegal wildlife trade in the African continent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug, not cocaine. This uses a different drug to create a plausible but incorrect answer, testing factual recall of specific UNODC findings.  The mention of the World Drug Day report highlights the UN's role in addressing drug abuse globally.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the report likely addresses wildlife crime globally, the text does not specify its focus being solely on Africa. This tests the ability to avoid making assumptions based on limited information. The mention of the World Wildlife Crime Report demonstrates the UN's efforts to combat illegal wildlife trade.  The seemingly limited scope of the statement is designed to be a distractor, testing the ability to resist making generalizations.



**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located in northeastern Kenya and southeastern Ethiopia, and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  Its primary water source is the Omo River, and a recent survey revealed a significant decline in its fish population.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia,  the description of it being the "world's largest permanent desert lake" is misleading.  It is the largest *permanent* desert lake in the world, but the phrasing in the statement is too broad.  Other lakes in different deserts might be larger, though not permanent. The emphasis on "permanent" is key to its unique status.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. A recent survey conducted by UNESCO and the World Food Programme (WFP) actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana after a 50-year gap in comprehensive surveys. This indicates a significant resource for the region, contrary to the claim of a population decline.  The statement presents inaccurate information regarding the survey's findings.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a stratovolcano located in Kenya, Africa, and is the second highest peak in Africa.
2.  It is considered the world's largest free-standing mountain, composed primarily of basalt and granite.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. Secondly, it is the *highest* peak in Africa, not the second highest.  These are fundamental geographical errors.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While it is indeed the world's largest free-standing mountain, its composition is described inaccurately. It's primarily composed of ash, lava, and rock, not basalt and granite exclusively.  While basalt and granite might be present, the description omits the crucial volcanic components.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, and facilitates trade between India and Nepal.
2.  The pass is situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand and significantly reduces travel time for the Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect in its description of the tri-junction. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The statement incorrectly substitutes Bhutan for Nepal, a significant geographical error.  The statement also inaccurately claims it facilitates trade between India and Nepal. While there have been trade routes through the pass historically, it is currently closed.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  The Lipulekh Pass is indeed situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand. However, it significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, not the Amarnath Yatra. The statement confuses two distinct pilgrimages.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, and is the shortest maritime route between Europe and North America.
2.  Recently, India has diverted some fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Panama Canal route due to geopolitical tensions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  The statement incorrectly identifies the bodies of water the canal connects. It also states it is the shortest maritime route between Europe and North America, which is geographically inaccurate;  the shortest route between Europe and North America is across the Atlantic Ocean.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India shifted some fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route, not the Panama Canal route.  The statement misidentifies the alternative route used by India. The shift is a strategic decision to avoid potential disruptions or increased costs associated with the Suez Canal.


**5. With reference to Australia, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Murray River is the longest river in Australia, and the Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system located off the west coast.
2. Australia has the world’s longest coastline and is characterized by its predominantly mountainous terrain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Murray River is indeed the longest river in Australia. However, the Great Barrier Reef is located off the *northeast* coast, not the west coast.  This is a significant geographical inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Australia does have a very long coastline, the claim of it being the "world's longest" is debatable and requires further clarification depending on the methodology used for measurement.  More importantly, Australia is known for its flat terrain, not mountainous terrain,  making the statement factually incorrect.


**6. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The two countries established a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2020 and a 2+2 Ministerial dialogue in 2022.
2.  Key areas of defense cooperation include the QUAD partnership, the Mutual Logistics Support Arrangement (MLSA), and joint military exercises such as AUSINDEX and Malabar.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) between India and Australia was signed in 2022, not 2020. The 2+2 Ministerial dialogue was indeed established in 2021.  The statement contains a factual error regarding the year of the CEPA signing.

Statement 2 is correct.  The QUAD partnership, MLSA, AUSINDEX, and Malabar exercises are all accurate representations of key defense cooperation initiatives between India and Australia.


**7. With reference to India-Japan relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The two countries upgraded their relationship to a "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" in 2014, and a key area of convergence is Japan’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy and India’s Act East Policy.
2.  Significant economic collaborations include the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2011, and cooperation in high-speed rail technology as evidenced by the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The relationship was upgraded to a "Special Strategic and Global Partnership" in 2014. However, the statement incorrectly links Japan's FOIP strategy with India's Act East Policy. While both strategies share some alignment in the Indo-Pacific region, the statement oversimplifies a complex geopolitical relationship.  The connection presented is an overgeneralization.

Statement 2 is correct.  The CEPA was signed in 2011, and Japan's substantial financial contribution and technological assistance to the Mumbai-Ahmedabad High-Speed Rail project accurately reflects the economic collaboration between the two nations.


**8. With reference to the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline, consider the following statements:**

1. The TAPI pipeline originates near Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, and terminates in New Delhi, India, spanning approximately 1,500 km.
2. It is one of the world's largest gas fields, and its construction has faced significant geopolitical challenges due to regional instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

2. Project Nexus, a collaborative initiative between Singapore and India, aims to connect their domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) including India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with FPSs of Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner for India, it is not India's largest globally.  The provided text indicates Singapore is India's largest trade partner within ASEAN and its 6th largest globally. This highlights the importance of the ASEAN region in India's foreign trade but also shows that other countries hold a larger share of India's overall trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Project Nexus aims to connect India's UPI with FPSs of Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, and Thailand.  The statement incorrectly omits Singapore from the list of participating countries, which is a key component of the project's design and objectives.  The inclusion of multiple countries underscores the project's ambition to foster regional financial integration and enhance cross-border payment efficiency.


**3. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India’s largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint energy initiative between India and Bangladesh, representing enhanced connectivity.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, which is correct. However, it incorrectly states that India is Bangladesh's *largest* trading partner in Asia. The text specifies that India is Bangladesh's *second* largest trading partner in Asia, indicating a significant but not the largest trade relationship.  This distinction highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of bilateral trade relationships.

Statement 2 is correct. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is explicitly mentioned in the provided text as an example of enhanced connectivity between India and Bangladesh. This project exemplifies the cooperation in energy infrastructure development between the two nations, strengthening their economic and strategic ties.


**4. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between India and Australia was established in 2021.
2.  The Australia-India Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative Partnership (AIIPOIP) focuses primarily on economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CSP between India and Australia was established in 2020, not 2021. This seemingly minor detail highlights the importance of precise chronological accuracy in understanding the evolution of bilateral relationships.  The establishment of the CSP marked a significant step in strengthening strategic cooperation between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the AIIPOIP involves aspects of economic cooperation, its focus is broader, encompassing maritime cooperation and security within the Indo-Pacific region. The partnership reflects the shared strategic interests and concerns of India and Australia in maintaining a stable and secure Indo-Pacific. The AIIPOIP is part of a wider framework of defense and security collaboration between the two nations.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft within a single region.
2.  Atoms4NetZero is an IAEA program focused on promoting renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB tracks incidents of nuclear material theft globally, not within a single region.  The database's global scope underscores the widespread nature of the challenge of preventing illicit trafficking of nuclear materials and the IAEA's role in international efforts to combat this threat.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Atoms4NetZero promotes the role of *nuclear* energy in achieving net-zero emissions, not renewable energy sources. This distinction highlights the complexities of energy policy and the ongoing debate about the role of nuclear power in a low-carbon future. The program reflects the IAEA's focus on the potential of nuclear technology for sustainable development.


**6. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat only money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1956.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER also assesses measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to money laundering and terrorist financing. This broader scope reflects the interconnected nature of these threats and the importance of a comprehensive approach to combating them.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), mentioned in the text, was established in 1956.  Confusing the establishment dates of these two organizations is a common mistake, highlighting the need for precise factual recall in this area.


**7. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India and Middle Eastern countries only.
2.  The IMEC initiative was first announced during a meeting of the G7 summit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IMEC aims to enhance connectivity between India, Middle Eastern countries, and Europe. The corridor's multi-regional scope highlights the ambition of creating a broader economic and trade network.  The inclusion of Europe underscores the strategic importance of connecting Asia and Europe through a diversified route.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text mentions the IMEC initiative being discussed at the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave, not at a G7 summit.  The source of the announcement is important to understand the context and political implications of the initiative.  The conclave's focus on business and trade provides a suitable context for unveiling an economic corridor plan.


**8. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus is the ninth member to join the SCO.
2. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 was endorsed at the 23rd summit of the Council of Heads of State.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus is the tenth member to join the SCO, not the ninth.  The addition of Belarus expands the organization's geographical reach and potentially its influence in regional affairs.  Precision in the number of member states is crucial for understanding the SCO's current composition and dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 was endorsed at the 24th summit, not the 23rd.  Keeping track of the summit numbers and their respective outcomes is important for monitoring the evolution of the SCO's agenda and priorities.  The development strategy sets a long-term vision for the organization's activities.


**9. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

2.  The Omo River is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Lake Turkana's location in both Kenya and Ethiopia is accurately described.  This transboundary location has implications for water resource management and cooperation between the two countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River is indeed the main source of water for Lake Turkana.  Understanding the hydrology of Lake Turkana is crucial for assessing its ecological significance and vulnerability to environmental changes.

**1. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon.
2.  China is India's largest trading partner in goods, but India has a significant trade surplus with China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC between India and China is a disputed border, and there is no formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon line.  The border is divided into three sectors (Western, Middle, and Eastern), with differing interpretations of the boundary line by both countries.  This lack of agreement is a major source of tension between the two nations.  The Johnson Line (India) and the McDonald Line (China) represent differing claims in the Western Sector, highlighting the contested nature of the LAC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While China is indeed India's largest trading partner in goods (as of 2023), India has a significant *trade deficit* with China, not a surplus. This means India imports far more goods from China than it exports to China, resulting in a negative balance of trade for India.  The substantial trade imbalance is a key aspect of the economic relationship between the two countries.


**2. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan, signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007, grants Bhutan complete autonomy in its foreign policy.
2.  India is Bhutan's top trade partner, and Bhutan enjoys a significant trade surplus with India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, renewed in 2007, emphasizes close cooperation between India and Bhutan, it doesn't grant Bhutan complete autonomy in its foreign policy.  The treaty reflects a special relationship where India plays a significant role in Bhutan's security and foreign affairs.  This close relationship, however, doesn't equate to complete independence in Bhutan's foreign policy decisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, but the balance of trade is significantly in *India's* favor, not Bhutan's.  This means India exports far more goods to Bhutan than it imports from Bhutan, creating a substantial trade surplus for India. The economic relationship reflects India's considerable influence on Bhutan's economy.


**3. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trade partner in Asia.
2.  The BBIN initiative (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) has been fully endorsed and is actively functioning with all four member states' participation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, although not necessarily its largest in Asia.  The significant trade relationship reflects the close geographical proximity and economic interconnectedness between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The BBIN initiative, while aiming for regional cooperation, has faced challenges, and Nepal's decision not to fully endorse the initiative due to sustainability and environmental concerns demonstrates that it's not fully functional with all four member states.  This highlights the complexities of regional cooperation in South Asia.


**4. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was a significant push for closer ties between the Maldives and China.
2.  The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives aims to help the Maldives reduce its dependence on the US dollar.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "India Out" campaign, while not solely focused on China, reflected a significant shift in Maldivian politics towards closer ties with China, potentially at the expense of the traditionally strong India-Maldives relationship. This campaign highlighted the evolving geopolitical dynamics in the Indian Ocean region.

Statement 2 is correct. The CSA between India and the Maldives is designed to enhance the Maldives' foreign exchange reserves and reduce its vulnerability to fluctuations in global currency markets. Although it doesn't explicitly mention reducing dependence on the US dollar, managing foreign exchange reserves implicitly helps reduce reliance on any single currency.


**5. With reference to the Global South, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Voice of Global South Summit (VOGSS), initiated by India, explicitly included China and Pakistan as participating nations.
2.  The proposed Global Development Compact (GDC) aims to address the rising debt burden of developing countries by promoting concessional financing and grants without imposing additional debt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The VOGSS, while aiming for broad participation from the Global South, notably excluded China and Pakistan from the invitation list, reflecting the complex geopolitical considerations shaping the initiative.  The exclusion points to the selective nature of the summit's participant selection.

Statement 2 is correct. The GDC, as proposed by India, focuses on a human-centric approach to development financing, aiming to provide support without creating further debt burdens for developing nations.  This highlights India's focus on sustainable and equitable development for the Global South.


**6. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India has a trade deficit with the United States.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) allows for reciprocal access to military bases between India and the US.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India actually enjoys a trade surplus with the United States, meaning it exports more goods to the US than it imports. This reflects the significant volume of Indian exports, particularly in services, to the US market.

Statement 2 is correct. LEMOA, signed in 2016, facilitates logistical support and access to military bases between India and the US, enhancing defense cooperation and interoperability.  This agreement is a key component of the growing defense partnership between the two countries.


**7. With reference to India-EFTA trade relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The India-EFTA Trade and Partnership Agreement (TEPA) is India's first free trade agreement with any EFTA member.
2.  Switzerland is India's largest trading partner among EFTA members, and India has a trade surplus with Switzerland.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. TEPA marks India's first FTA with EFTA members, signifying a significant step in expanding India's trade relations with European countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Switzerland is indeed India's largest trading partner among EFTA members, India has a trade *deficit* with Switzerland due to substantial gold imports from Switzerland. This highlights the nature of bilateral trade and the impact of specific commodity trade on the overall balance.


**8. With reference to the TAPI gas pipeline project, consider the following statements:**

1.  The TAPI pipeline originates from the Galkynysh gas field in northern Turkmenistan.
2.  The pipeline's route passes through Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, although more precisely, the Galkynysh gas field is located in *south-eastern* Turkmenistan. This minor geographical detail doesn't alter the core fact that the pipeline originates from this major gas field.

Statement 2 is correct. The TAPI pipeline's planned route traverses Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, aiming to diversify energy sources for these countries.  This ambitious project highlights the potential for regional energy cooperation, although its execution has faced significant geopolitical challenges.


**9. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Australia's National Defense Strategy 2024 identifies India as a 'top-tier security partner' in the Indo-Pacific region.
2.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between India and Australia includes a 3+2 ministerial dialogue format.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Australia's 2024 National Defense Strategy clearly designates India as a top-tier security partner, reflecting the growing convergence of strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CSP between India and Australia includes a 2+2 ministerial dialogue format, involving meetings between the foreign and defense ministers of both countries.  The '3+2' is an inaccurate representation of the established dialogue structure.


**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, enacted in 1993, mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles by signatory nations within a decade of ratification.
2. India, a signatory to the CWC, established the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to oversee the implementation of the convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC aims for the complete destruction of chemical weapons, it doesn't set a rigid timeframe of a decade after ratification.  The destruction process is complex and timelines vary depending on the size and nature of a nation's stockpile.  The convention establishes a framework for phased destruction, with deadlines set on a case-by-case basis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is an independent international organization, not established by India.  It was established by the CWC itself and operates independently to monitor compliance and enforce the treaty's provisions globally. India, as a signatory, is subject to the OPCW's oversight.  The confusion might arise from India's active participation in the OPCW's work.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assess a country's effectiveness in combating terrorist financing but not money laundering.
2. India's MER, first adopted in 2010, is reviewed every five years by a panel of independent experts from various countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. FATF's MERs comprehensively assess a country's measures to combat both money laundering and terrorist financing, as well as the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The statement wrongly restricts the assessment to only terrorist financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, the review process is not conducted every five years by an independent panel.  The peer review process is conducted by other FATF member states. The frequency and specifics of the review are determined by the FATF's procedures, not a fixed five-year cycle.


**3. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 highlighted that cocaine is the most widely abused drug globally, surpassing cannabis.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on the illegal trade of endangered species, excluding other forms of wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's report indicates that cannabis remains the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids.  The statement incorrectly states that cocaine has surpassed cannabis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses heavily on the illegal trade of endangered species, it also addresses a broader range of wildlife crime issues, including those related to non-endangered species and other forms of exploitation. The statement wrongly limits the report's scope.


**4. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear material theft within the member states of the IAEA.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative primarily focuses on promoting nuclear energy for electricity generation, disregarding other potential applications.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB primarily focuses on tracking incidents related to nuclear material theft, it's not limited only to IAEA member states.  The database includes reports from various sources globally, aiming for a comprehensive overview of illicit trafficking.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative aims to utilize nuclear technologies to achieve net-zero emissions across various sectors, not solely focused on electricity generation. This includes applications in other energy sectors, industrial processes, and transportation, among others.


**5. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)'s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses countries based on their commitment to five key cybersecurity pillars, excluding economic factors.
2. India was ranked among the top three countries globally in the GCI 2024, demonstrating exceptional commitment to cybersecurity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GCI 2024 uses a multi-pillar framework to assess national cybersecurity capabilities, encompassing legal, technical, organizational, capacity building, and cooperation aspects.  Economic factors are not a direct assessment criterion, although they might indirectly influence a nation's ability to invest in cybersecurity infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India is recognized as a "role model" country in the GCI, indicating a strong commitment, it was not ranked among the top three globally.  The statement misrepresents India's ranking in the report.


**6. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CMF is a coalition of solely Western navies operating primarily in the Mediterranean Sea.
2. India's participation in the CMF involves contributing naval ships to Combined Task Force 150, primarily focused on counter-terrorism operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition, not limited to Western navies. It comprises navies from various regions, working together to enhance maritime security in a wider area, including the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean region.

Statement 2 is correct. India's participation in the CMF involves contributing naval assets to Combined Task Force 150, which focuses on maritime security operations, including counter-terrorism and counter-piracy efforts. The statement accurately describes India's role and the task force's primary mandate.


**7. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas" but doesn't allow them to arrest individuals without warrants.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in all of the seven North-Eastern states of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AFSPA does grant special powers, including the authority to arrest individuals without warrants in designated "disturbed areas." The statement incorrectly states that warrantless arrests are prohibited under AFSPA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA is not in effect across all seven North-Eastern states. Its applicability is limited to specific areas within certain states deemed "disturbed" based on security assessments. The statement overstates the geographical reach of AFSPA.


**8. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions exclusively focus on protecting combatants during armed conflicts.
2.  India is a signatory to all four Geneva Conventions but has not ratified any of the additional protocols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions protect not only combatants but also non-combatants, including civilians, prisoners of war, and the wounded and sick, during armed conflicts.  The statement wrongly limits the conventions' scope to only combatants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is a signatory and has ratified all four Geneva Conventions of 1949. The statement incorrectly claims that India hasn't ratified any additional protocols.  While the exact protocols ratified may vary, India's commitment to IHL is evident through its ratification of the main conventions.



**9. With reference to the Commonwealth of Nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth's decisions are made through majority voting, with larger member states holding greater influence.
2.  The current Head of the Commonwealth is the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Commonwealth operates on the principle of consensus decision-making, not majority voting. All member states are considered equal, and decisions are reached through agreement, not by the weight of votes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Head of the Commonwealth is the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom, currently King Charles III. The statement wrongly attributes the headship to the UK Prime Minister.  The monarch's role is largely symbolic within the Commonwealth.


**10. With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The India-GCC Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 primarily focuses on military cooperation and intelligence sharing.
2. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2013.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While security cooperation is a component of the India-GCC Joint Action Plan, it is not the primary focus.  The plan encompasses a broader range of areas, including economic, trade, energy, cultural, and people-to-people ties.  The statement overemphasizes the military aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2003, not 2013. The statement contains an error in the timeline of the dialogue.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of measures against cybercrime.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and its measures to combat money laundering include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) in 2004.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a significant concern, it's not explicitly stated to be *excluded* from the MER's scope. The focus remains on the core areas mentioned.  The question attempts to mislead by introducing a related but distinct area of concern.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The PMLA, 2002, is a key legislative framework in India's anti-money laundering efforts. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence.  The statement accurately reflects these facts.  The inclusion of both the Act and the FIU strengthens the correctness of the statement.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, with cocaine being the least abused among the substances mentioned.
2. The UNODC's reports highlight the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Golden Triangle" (now "Death Triangle," comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNODC report does indeed identify cannabis as the most widely abused drug, the statement incorrectly positions cocaine as the least abused among the listed substances. The relative ranking of opioid abuse compared to other drugs mentioned might vary depending on the specific report and year.  This deliberate misrepresentation of the relative ranking of drug abuse makes this a challenging statement to evaluate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UNODC reports consistently highlight the "Triple Frontier Area" and the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle") as major drug trafficking hotspots. The geographic locations and the countries involved are accurately represented in the statement. The addition of the newer name "Death Triangle" adds a layer of difficulty as it requires up-to-date knowledge.


**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft within the member states of the IAEA, disregarding any incidents outside of the membership.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve global food security, while Atoms4NetZero focuses on promoting renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB's scope is not limited to only IAEA member states.  While the database primarily focuses on reported incidents, it is not inherently restricted by national boundaries or membership status.  The statement introduces a false limitation to the database's reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Atoms4Food correctly describes the IAEA's program using nuclear techniques for food security, the description of Atoms4NetZero is inaccurate. Atoms4NetZero focuses on promoting *nuclear* energy, not renewable energy sources, to help achieve net-zero emissions. This subtle but crucial difference makes the statement false.  The deliberate substitution of "renewable energy" for "nuclear energy" is a key distractor.


**4. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments across five pillars, with India categorized as a "role-modeling" country in Tier 1, demonstrating a strong commitment to all five pillars.
2.  The ITU's GCI 2024 indicates that most countries are either "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4) in their cybersecurity capabilities, with a significant number already achieving "mature" (Tier 2) status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GCI 2024 does indeed assess cybersecurity commitments across five pillars, and India's placement in Tier 1 as a "role-modeling" country accurately reflects the report's findings.  The statement provides specific details that are verifiable.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement misrepresents the distribution of countries across the different tiers of cybersecurity capabilities. While it is true that many countries are in Tiers 3 and 4, the assertion that a *significant* number have already reached "mature" (Tier 2) status is not supported by the available information from the report.  The introduction of the "mature" status adds a layer of complexity, making it difficult to assess without precise data.


**5. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) and Operation Crimson Barracuda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy after India joined the CMF in 2022, demonstrating India's commitment to regional maritime security.
2. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on combating piracy and terrorism in the Indian Ocean region, with a secondary focus on countering drug trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy *after* joining the CMF in 2022. This highlights India's active participation in CMF operations beyond its initial role.

Statement 2 is correct. The CMF's primary focus is on combating piracy and terrorism, but drug trafficking is also a significant area of concern within the coalition's operational scope.  The statement accurately reflects the CMF's multi-faceted approach to maritime security.  The use of the words "primarily focused" and "secondary focus" adds a layer of complexity, requiring careful understanding.


**6. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas," allowing them to arrest and search premises without warrants, but it prohibits the use of lethal force unless absolutely necessary.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh, but it has been repealed in Jammu and Kashmir.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AFSPA does grant extensive powers, including the ability to arrest and search without warrants, it *does not* prohibit the use of lethal force. The Act allows the use of force, even lethal force, under specific circumstances. This crucial detail is omitted or misrepresented to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. AFSPA remains in effect in the stated areas.  However,  in Jammu and Kashmir, although AFSPA was previously in effect, it has been replaced by a similar but distinct act, the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990. This subtle distinction makes the second statement correct.  The mention of the repeal in J&K is a strong distractor.


**7. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, focusing on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure projects in developing nations, with a primary emphasis on road infrastructure development.
2.  The PGII is a G7-led initiative, with significant financial contributions from all G7 member nations, and it operates independently of other international financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PGII does aim to mobilize $600 billion and focus on sustainable and inclusive infrastructure, there's no mention of a *primary emphasis* on road infrastructure. The scope of the initiative is broader, encompassing various types of infrastructure projects. The addition of "primary emphasis on road infrastructure" is a significant fabrication.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the PGII was launched within the G7 framework, it does not operate *independently* of other international financial institutions.  It seeks to complement and coordinate with existing institutions to leverage resources effectively. The claim of independence is a misleading oversimplification.


**8. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list highlights the movement's commitment to multilateralism and its opposition to unilateral coercive measures.
2.  NAM comprises a diverse group of nations, primarily from the Global South, but it excludes all countries with significant economic ties to the United States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's stance on Cuba's inclusion on the US terrorism list accurately reflects the movement's principles of multilateralism and opposition to unilateral actions.  The statement effectively captures the essence of NAM's position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAM's membership is diverse and includes countries with varying levels of economic engagement with the United States.  The statement introduces a false and overly restrictive condition for membership.  The exclusionary nature of the second statement is a key distractor.


**9. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing nearly 60% of its total population, and it is also the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth's budget.
2.  The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, provides funding for various development projects in Commonwealth countries, focusing primarily on infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is indeed the largest member by population, it is not the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth's budget.  The statement incorrectly attributes the largest financial contribution to India.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Commonwealth Sub Window does provide funding, it does not primarily focus on infrastructure development. Its scope is broader, encompassing various development areas.  The focus on infrastructure development is a misrepresentation of the Sub Window's activities.  The statement uses a strong distractor by focusing on the infrastructure aspect.


**10. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus recently became the 10th member of the SCO, expanding the organization's geographical reach and influence.
2.  The SCO's primary focus is on military cooperation and joint military exercises among its member states, with economic cooperation playing a secondary role.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO is a well-documented fact, expanding the organization's membership and influence.  The statement accurately reflects a recent and significant development within the SCO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO does involve some level of military cooperation, its primary focus is on broader security cooperation and economic collaboration among its member states.  Military cooperation is not the dominant focus.  The statement incorrectly prioritizes military cooperation over the more comprehensive approach of the SCO.  The emphasis on "primary focus" and "secondary role" is a key distractor.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is situated in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  The primary water source for Lake Turkana is the Omo River, originating in Ethiopia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia,  the description as the "world's largest permanent desert lake" is misleading. While it is the largest *permanent* desert lake in the world,  the phrasing might lead to confusion with other large lakes that might have a larger surface area but are not necessarily permanent or entirely within desert regions. The statement needs to be more precise to avoid ambiguity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River, originating in the Ethiopian highlands, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.  This is a crucial fact highlighting the transboundary nature of the lake's water resources and the importance of regional cooperation for its management.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Kenya, known for its significant height and unique geological formation as a free-standing mountain.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano and a free-standing mountain, it's located in Tanzania, not Kenya. This is a crucial geographical detail that demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge about the mountain's location.  The description  "significant height" is vague and doesn't convey the specific importance of its status as the highest peak in Africa.

Statement 2 is correct. Uhuru Peak, located on Mount Kilimanjaro, is the highest point in Africa, making it a significant landmark and a challenging yet popular destination for mountaineering expeditions. This highlights the mountain's importance in both geographical and adventure tourism contexts.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, and serves as a crucial trade route between India and China.
2.  The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, but its strategic importance is limited due to its remote location.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan. This is a significant geographical error that demonstrates a lack of understanding of the region's geopolitical boundaries.  While it has been used for trade historically, stating it serves as a "crucial trade route" is an oversimplification, considering the complexities of the India-China relationship and border disputes in the region.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Lipulekh Pass does significantly reduce travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, making it an important route for religious tourism. However, characterizing its strategic importance as "limited" is debatable; its location along a disputed border has significant geopolitical implications.  The statement's phrasing is a bit subjective and could be more precise.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal, located in Egypt, is the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe, and its closure would significantly impact global trade.
2. Recent geopolitical events have caused India to shift its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the significantly longer Cape of Good Hope route, highlighting its strategic importance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Suez Canal, situated in Egypt, is indeed the shortest maritime route connecting Asia and Europe, significantly reducing travel time and transportation costs for global trade.  Its closure or disruption would have far-reaching consequences on global supply chains and economic activity.

Statement 2 is also correct. Recent geopolitical events, such as the closure of the canal or increased instability in the region, have prompted India to use alternative routes for its fuel exports to Europe, such as the Cape of Good Hope route. This longer route demonstrates the canal's strategic importance in global trade and highlights the vulnerability of relying on a single crucial waterway.

This highlights the involvement of other major global players in the dispute and its implications for regional stability and international relations.


**6. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is a formally demarcated boundary, with the Western sector being the most disputed area.
2.  Recent agreements between India and China have resulted in complete disengagement in all areas of friction along the LAC, including the Depsang Plains and Demchok areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC between India and China is *not* a formally demarcated boundary; it's a disputed line, and the Western sector is indeed one of the most contentious areas.  The statement incorrectly presents the LAC as a clearly defined border, overlooking the ongoing disputes and complexities in defining it.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While there have been some agreements between India and China resulting in disengagement in certain areas of friction along the LAC, the statement's claim of "complete disengagement in all areas," including the Depsang Plains and Demchok areas, is an overstatement.  Disputes and tensions continue to exist in multiple sections along the LAC.


**7. With reference to the Gulf of Aden, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gulf of Aden is a crucial maritime route connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, and is prone to piracy.
2.  Recent pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden have prompted increased international naval patrols in the region to ensure safe passage of ships.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gulf of Aden is a significant maritime route connecting the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, making it a crucial passage for international shipping. Its strategic location, however, makes it vulnerable to piracy, a persistent challenge for maritime security in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands in Chinese) are located in the East China Sea,  approximately 410 km west of Okinawa Island,  and are claimed by both China and Japan. The statement's proximity to Taiwan is a minor oversimplification as  the distance is not insignificant.

Statement 2 is also correct. A joint statement by Japan and the USA did express opposition to any unilateral attempts by China to alter the status quo of the Senkaku Islands. This underscores the geopolitical implications of the dispute and the involvement of other major powers, highlighting the complexities of the situation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was fueled by concerns regarding the presence of Indian military personnel and the perceived encroachment on Maldivian sovereignty, not primarily economic issues or lack of support for local businesses.  While economic anxieties might have played a secondary role, the core of the campaign was rooted in nationalistic sentiments and concerns over strategic influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives is a crucial financial arrangement designed to help the Maldives manage its foreign exchange reserves.  CSAs provide a safety net during times of economic instability, enabling countries to exchange currencies at a pre-agreed rate, thereby mitigating the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and ensuring liquidity. This directly addresses the vulnerability of smaller economies like the Maldives to external economic shocks.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The McMahon Line is relevant to the Eastern Sector of the LAC, not the Western Sector.  The Western Sector involves different historical claims and interpretations of the border, making the McMahon Line irrelevant in this context.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Johnson Line, a British-era demarcation, forms the basis of India's claim in the Western Sector of the LAC.  While the actual Line of Actual Control (LAC) is not formally demarcated, and there are disputes over its precise location, the Johnson Line serves as a crucial reference point for India's position in this strategically sensitive region.  Understanding the historical context of boundary claims is crucial for analyzing the India-China border dispute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect while statement 2 is correct. The Kursk region's location in the Eastern European Plain and its proximity to Ukraine are accurate. However, the statement that it *includes* the basins of the Dnieper and Don rivers is misleading. While it is in the vicinity of these river basins, it doesn't encompass them entirely.  

Statement 2 is correct. Pangong Tso's location in Ladakh, its high altitude, and the fact that it's partially located in both India and China are accurate; however, classifying it definitively as the world's *highest* saltwater lake requires further verification as there may be other contenders depending on the criteria used for measurement (elevation vs. altitude of the highest point, etc.).


**9. With reference to the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, consider the following statements:**

1. The TAPI gas pipeline project aims to transport natural gas from the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The TAPI pipeline project's objective of transporting natural gas from the Galkynysh field in Turkmenistan to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Galkynysh gas field is indeed among the world's largest, the statement that it spans 1,800 km *from* Turkmenistan to the other countries is inaccurate.  The 1,800 km figure refers to the *approximate length of the pipeline itself*, not the distance of the gas field to the destination countries.  The gas field's location and the pipeline's route are two distinct aspects.


**10. With reference to international organizations and summits, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain.
2.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has been requested to assist low-income countries in accessing financial resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, excluding cybercrime.
2. India's MER, first adopted in 2010, was recently reviewed and updated in Singapore, highlighting its robust anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the FATF's MER explicitly includes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a key area of assessment.  While cybercrime is a growing concern and related to financial crimes, it's not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus within the MER's scope. The MER’s main focus is on the traditional aspects of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010 and has undergone subsequent reviews. The fact that it was recently adopted in Singapore indicates ongoing assessment and updating of India's AML/CFT measures. The statement accurately reflects the ongoing process of evaluation and the acknowledgement of India's efforts.  The plenary session in Singapore signifies a recent update and reaffirmation of at least some aspects of the report, though not necessarily a complete overhaul.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies in Statement 1 and the correctness of Statement 2.



**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a major region affected by illicit wildlife trafficking, but not drug trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report clearly states that cannabis is the most abused drug globally.  The statement incorrectly positions cocaine as the most abused substance. This is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the "Golden Triangle" (Death Triangle) is indeed highlighted in relation to drug trafficking, the statement incorrectly suggests it's *not* implicated in drug trafficking. The region is notorious for its role in the production and trafficking of illicit drugs, particularly opium and its derivatives.  The report likely covers both wildlife crime and drug trafficking in the region, hence the statement's inaccuracy.

Both statements contain factual inaccuracies, making (d) "Neither 1 nor 2" the correct answer.



**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council, where India serves as Vice-Chair, focuses solely on enhancing digital infrastructure and technology transfer among participating nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council has a broader mandate than just digital infrastructure and technology transfer.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPEF does indeed feature a Crisis Response Network and a Labor Rights Advisory Board, as described in the statement. These are integral parts of the framework, aiming to address both emergency situations and labor standards within regional supply chains.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.



**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's 24th summit, held in Astana, Kazakhstan, resulted in the expansion of the organization to include Pakistan as its tenth member.
2.  The SCO adopted a new Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024-2029, but did not adopt any plans concerning counter-terrorism or extremism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Belarus, not Pakistan, became the tenth member of the SCO at the Astana summit. This is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the adoption of a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism for 2025-2027, alongside the Anti-Drug Strategy.  The statement falsely claims that no counter-terrorism plans were adopted.

Both statements contain factual inaccuracies, making (d) the correct option.

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, primarily for infrastructure projects in developed nations.
2. India's participation in the G7 summit in Apulia, Italy, was as a full member, reflecting its growing influence in global affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII aims to mobilize funds for infrastructure projects in *developing* nations, not developed ones.  This represents a crucial difference in the initiative's focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India participated as an *Outreach Country*, not a full member.  Outreach countries are invited to participate in G7 discussions but do not hold full voting rights or membership status.

Both statements contain factual inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.


**6. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported a decrease in incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023 compared to previous years.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve global food security and reduce reliance on chemical fertilizers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that the ITDB reported *168* incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023, indicating an increase or at least no decrease from previous years. The statement misrepresents the data.

Statement 2 is correct. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program indeed uses nuclear techniques to enhance food production and security.  The focus on reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers is a plausible and related aspect of the program's goals, though not explicitly stated in the source.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India is among the "role modelling" countries (Tier 1), demonstrating a strong commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars. The statement misrepresents India's ranking.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GCI 2024 does indeed assess countries based on their commitment across five cybersecurity pillars, as stated.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct choice.



**8. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda, a drug seizure operation under CMF's Combined Task Force-150, marked its first such operation after joining the CMF in 2021.
2.  The CMF primarily focuses on counter-piracy operations in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, with a secondary role in counter-terrorism efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2021, and Operation Crimson Barracuda was its first operation *after* joining.  The year of joining is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is also not entirely accurate. While counter-piracy is a significant aspect of the CMF's activities, the statement's phrasing implies a clear prioritization of counter-piracy over counter-terrorism. The CMF has a broader mandate encompassing various maritime security threats, including counter-terrorism.

Both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.



**9. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The AFSPA has been recently extended indefinitely to the entire states of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.
2. The AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in specified areas, including the power to arrest and detain individuals without warrants.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text specifies that the AFSPA's extension applies to *parts* of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, not the entire states.  This is a crucial distinction.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AFSPA does grant the armed forces extensive powers in designated areas, including the authority to arrest and detain without warrants under certain conditions. This is a key feature of the Act.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.



**10. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term signifies India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts, but his term begins in 2024.
2. The INCB is a quasi-judicial body responsible for monitoring the implementation of the UN drug control conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that the CCPCJ's 33rd session addressed *transnational organized crime* (TOC) in general, not solely cybercrime.  The statement oversimplifies the session's focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The GenJust initiative, as described in the text, aims to involve youth in crime prevention and criminal justice.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.



**12. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct option.



**14. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. The recently announced SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 aims to promote regional financial stability and facilitate cross-border payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is an independent and quasi-judicial body that monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties.  The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 is a cornerstone of international drug control, and the INCB plays a crucial role in ensuring its effective implementation. Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term reflects India's sustained commitment to international cooperation in combating drug trafficking and abuse, enhancing its global standing in this critical area.

1.  The CCPCJ's 33rd session primarily focused on combating cybercrime and data breaches.
2.  The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to involve young people in crime prevention efforts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the CCPCJ addresses a broad range of crime-related issues, its 33rd session specifically highlighted transnational organized crime (TOC). Cybercrime is a significant aspect of TOC but wasn't the primary focus of that particular session.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, launched during the 33rd session, is explicitly designed to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice. This initiative recognizes the importance of youth participation in shaping safer and more just societies. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1.  GlobE's primary objective is to facilitate the sharing of best practices among anti-corruption agencies.
2.  India's election to GlobE's steering committee signifies its commitment to combating corruption within its own borders.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The GlobE network serves as a platform for international cooperation among anti-corruption law enforcement agencies.  Its core function is to foster the exchange of information, strategies, and best practices to enhance the effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts globally.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  India's participation in GlobE's steering committee demonstrates its active engagement in international anti-corruption initiatives. This signals not only a commitment to addressing corruption domestically but also a willingness to contribute to global efforts in this area.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.


**4. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's effectiveness in combating illicit financial flows related to drug trafficking.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, indicating the country's long-standing engagement with the FATF.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's MER process assesses a country's compliance with international standards aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.  While drug trafficking is a significant source of illicit financial flows, the MER's scope extends beyond this to include other forms of financial crime.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  India's first MER adoption in 2010 marks a significant milestone in its cooperation with the FATF.  This demonstrates a long-term commitment to upholding international standards related to combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct.


**5. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most widely abused drug globally.
2.  The "Golden Crescent" region, now referred to as the "Death Crescent," encompasses Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally.  Cocaine is a significant concern but ranks below cannabis in terms of global abuse prevalence. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC reports have indeed identified the "Golden Crescent" region (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) as a major drug-producing area.  This region is increasingly referred to as the "Death Crescent" due to the high levels of drug-related violence and instability.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border between India and China.
2.  China's claim in the Western Sector of the LAC is based on the Johnson Line.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The LAC is not a formally demarcated border; its precise location remains a subject of dispute between India and China.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  In the Western Sector, China's claim is based on the McDonald Line, not the Johnson Line.  The Johnson Line is the Indian claim in this sector. Therefore, statement 2 is also incorrect.


**7. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.
2.  India is not a signatory to the CWC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The CWC comprehensively bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  India *is* a signatory to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to implement its provisions domestically. Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.


**8. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commonwealth's decisions are made through majority voting, reflecting a democratic process.
2.  Barbados removed the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth operates on a consensus-based decision-making process; all members are considered equal, and decisions require unanimous agreement.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  Barbados did indeed become a republic in 2021, removing the British monarch as its head of state.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**9.  With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue was recently held, resulting in the adoption of a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028.
2. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2003.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The provided text explicitly mentions both the recent India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting and the adoption of a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028.  It also states that the first India-GCC Political Dialogue occurred in 2003.  Therefore, both statements are correct.



**10. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2023, signifying the organization's enhanced legal standing.
2.  BIMSTEC's major projects include a master plan for transport connectivity and disaster management exercises (DMEX).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The BIMSTEC charter came into force on May 20, 2024, not 2023.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions both a BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity and BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercises (DMEX) as major initiatives.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**11. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The US House of Representatives passed the “Strengthening the Quad Act” to bolster cooperation among the Quad members.
2.  The Quad Leaders’ Summit in Wilmington resulted in the adoption of the "Wilmington Declaration," which included initiatives on cancer research and sustainable port infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the passage of the “Strengthening the Quad Act” by the US House of Representatives and the adoption of the Wilmington Declaration at the Quad Leaders’ Summit, including initiatives such as the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" and the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership."  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**12. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  Key initiatives in India-Bangladesh cooperation include the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant and the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The statement that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia is correct, but the statement that India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia is incorrect;  India is the second largest. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly mentions the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant and the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline as examples of cooperation between the two countries. Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**13. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.
2.  India and Bhutan have jointly developed several hydropower projects, including Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the signing of a trilateral pact among Nepal, India, and Bangladesh for cross-border electricity trade.  It also lists Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu as examples of hydropower projects developed in collaboration between India and Bhutan.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**14. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" by the central government.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Jammu and Kashmir through a separate act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text correctly describes AFSPA as granting special powers to armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" but clarifies that the declaration can be made by the Governor, administrator, or the central government. This makes statement 1 correct although slightly misleading.  The text also explicitly states that AFSPA remains in force in Jammu and Kashmir through the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990.  Therefore, statement 2 is correct.


**15. With reference to major peace accords in Northeast India, consider the following statements:**

1. The Shillong Accord (1975) was signed between the Government of India and the Naga National Council (NNC).
2. The Bru-Reang Agreement (2020) resolved the long-standing displacement issue of the Bru community in Tripura and Mizoram.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions both the Shillong Accord (1975) and its signatories (Government of India and the NNC) and the Bru-Reang Agreement (2020) and its resolution of the Bru community's displacement.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**16.  With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is designated as a Major Defence Partner of the United States.
2.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been used against India.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The text confirms that the US designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016.  Therefore, statement 1 is correct.  However, the text mentions that the US State Department warned India of potential sanctions under CAATSA following the India-Iran deal on the Chabahar port, indicating that the threat of CAATSA sanctions against India has existed.  Therefore, statement 2 is incorrect.



**1. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2009 with the objective of reducing trade barriers and deepening economic ties between ASEAN and India.
2.  India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN nations due to the preferential tariffs under AITIGA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) was indeed signed in 2009 with the primary goal of lowering trade barriers and fostering stronger economic relationships between India and the ASEAN member states.  This involved reducing or eliminating tariffs on a significant number of goods traded between the regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Contrary to the statement, India experiences a persistent trade deficit with ASEAN. This means that the value of goods imported from ASEAN countries consistently exceeds the value of goods exported from India to ASEAN.  While AITIGA aimed to improve trade balance, it hasn't resulted in a trade surplus for India.  Several factors contribute to this persistent deficit, including the competitiveness of ASEAN manufactured goods and differences in production capabilities.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA):**

1. A CSA is a contract where two parties agree to exchange currencies at a predetermined rate, with a future re-exchange at a potentially different rate.
2.  India's Currency Swap Agreements are exclusively limited to bilateral arrangements with individual nations, excluding multilateral agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA).  CSAs are financial contracts used to manage currency risk. Two parties agree to exchange a specified amount of one currency for another at a fixed exchange rate on a particular date.  Later, they reverse the transaction, potentially at a different rate, effectively hedging against exchange rate fluctuations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India does participate in numerous bilateral CSAs (for example, with Japan and the UAE), it is also involved in multilateral CSA arrangements. A notable example is the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement, a multilateral arrangement among the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) that includes elements of currency swap facilities. This demonstrates that India's CSA participation extends beyond purely bilateral agreements.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in IPEF is limited to the Supply Chain Council, excluding other pillars of the framework.
2. The IPEF's "Clean Economy" pillar focuses solely on renewable energy sources, excluding any investment in conventional energy infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's involvement in IPEF is not restricted to just the Supply Chain Council.  India actively participates in multiple pillars of the IPEF, including the "Clean Economy" and "Fair Economy" agreements.  Its participation reflects a broader commitment to the framework's objectives beyond supply chain resilience.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IPEF's "Clean Economy" pillar has a wider scope than solely renewable energy.  While promoting clean energy technologies and deployment is a key aspect, the pillar also encompasses broader initiatives aimed at improving energy efficiency and sustainability across various sectors.  Investment in  supporting technologies and capacity building for MSMEs is also included.  The focus is on a transition to cleaner energy systems, but not an exclusion of all other energy sources.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1.  Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 makes it the eleventh member of the organization.
2. The SCO's primary focus is on economic cooperation, with minimal emphasis on security or counter-terrorism initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Belarus did join the SCO, its accession brought the total membership to ten, not eleven.  The SCO has a defined membership structure, and Belarus's inclusion increased the number from nine to ten.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The SCO's mandate is not solely focused on economic cooperation.  While economic cooperation is a significant aspect, the SCO also addresses a range of security challenges, including counter-terrorism, regional stability, and cross-border crime.  Its initiatives reflect a multifaceted approach encompassing both economic and security dimensions.  The adoption of counter-terrorism and anti-drug strategies underscores this broader focus.


**5. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 has a permanent secretariat that oversees its operations and implements its decisions.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is solely focused on providing grants to developing nations for infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Unlike some other international organizations, the G7 lacks a permanent, independent secretariat.  Its operations are largely coordinated through the rotating presidency, which sets the agenda and leads the initiatives for each year. This rotating presidency model gives each member country a chance to shape the G7's priorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII is not limited to providing grants. While it aims to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects in developing countries, the mechanisms go beyond simply granting funds.  The initiative aims to leverage both public and private investment through various financial instruments, including loans and other forms of financial support.  The goal is to attract substantial investment to help build sustainable infrastructure.


**6. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's charter came into force before 2024, marking a significant milestone for the organization.
2.  All decisions within BIMSTEC are made through a weighted voting system, reflecting the varying sizes and economic strengths of its member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC charter, a crucial step in solidifying the organization's structure and mandate, came into force in May 2024.  This marked a significant development in the organization's evolution, but it was not in effect prior to that date.  The ratification process by all member states was a prerequisite for its implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. BIMSTEC operates on the principle of consensus.  Unlike organizations with weighted voting systems, decisions are made through unanimous agreement among all member states. This consensus-based decision-making approach emphasizes cooperation and mutual respect among the diverse members.  This collaborative approach can sometimes lead to slower decision-making but ensures that all members feel represented and involved.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia's third term on the INCB will commence in 2025 and conclude in 2030.
2. The INCB's mandate is limited to combating the illegal production and trafficking of cannabis, excluding other illicit drugs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term, covering the period from 2025 to 2030, is accurate.  His continued presence on the board reflects India's commitment to international drug control efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The INCB's responsibilities encompass a broader range of controlled substances than just cannabis.  Its mandate includes monitoring and regulating the production, trade, and use of various drugs under international control.  The board's reports and activities address a wide spectrum of illicit drugs, reflecting the global nature of the drug control challenge.


**8. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is a formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon boundary.
2.  China's claim to Arunachal Pradesh is based on its interpretation of the McMahon Line.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is not a formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon boundary.  It represents a de facto border, often disputed and subject to varying interpretations by both India and China.  The lack of a formally agreed-upon boundary line is a significant source of tension between the two countries.  The absence of a clearly defined LAC frequently leads to disagreements and incidents along the border.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While China claims Arunachal Pradesh, its basis for this claim is not the McMahon Line.  China rejects the McMahon Line as a legitimate boundary, arguing that it was not legitimately signed by the representatives of the Chinese government.  Therefore, China's claim to Arunachal Pradesh is based on its own historical interpretations and not on acceptance of the McMahon Line.


**9. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore has resulted in a significant trade surplus for India.
2.  "Project Nexus" aims to link India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with the fast payment systems of several Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CECA between India and Singapore has not led to a trade surplus for India.  India consistently experiences a trade deficit with Singapore, with imports from Singapore exceeding exports to Singapore.  Despite the aim of improving trade balance through the CECA, various economic factors contribute to this trade imbalance.

Statement 2 is correct. Project Nexus is a collaborative initiative between India and Singapore aimed at facilitating faster and more efficient cross-border payments.  A key component is the interconnection of India's UPI with the fast payment systems (FPS) of several Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore, and other countries like Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand. This initiative improves financial connectivity and ease of transactions in the region.  The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) is facilitating the project.


**1. With reference to multinational military exercises involving the Indian Navy, consider the following statements:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise involving the Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies, held biennially in the Indian Ocean.
2. Exercise Cutlass Express, a U.S. Naval Forces-led multinational maritime exercise, has seen participation from the Indian Navy in the past.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IBSAMAR VIII is indeed a joint multinational maritime exercise involving the Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies, the provided text does not specify its frequency.  The assertion that it is held biennially is not supported by the given information.  The location is also not specifically mentioned as the Indian Ocean.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that the Indian Navy participated in the U.S. Naval Forces-led multinational maritime Exercise Cutlass Express in Seychelles.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly include statement 1 or incorrectly exclude statement 2.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately assess information presented and avoid making assumptions based on incomplete data.


**2. With reference to multinational air exercises with Indian participation, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Pitch Black, a biennial multinational air exercise hosted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), involves more than 20 participating countries and over 140 aircraft.
2.  Desert Flag, a multilateral air exercise, includes participation from the Air Forces of UAE, France, Kuwait, and several other nations, but not the Indian Air Force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Exercise Pitch Black is a biennial multinational air exercise with participation from over 20 countries and more than 140 aircraft.  The Indian Air Force's participation is also mentioned.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While Desert Flag is indeed a multilateral air exercise involving the Air Forces of UAE, France, Kuwait, and others, the provided text does *not* state that the Indian Air Force does *not* participate. The absence of explicit mention of Indian participation does not confirm non-participation.  The statement creates a false negative by omission.


Therefore, only statement 1 is definitively correct based on the provided text.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include or exclude statement 1 or 2 based on an unsupported assumption about Indian Air Force participation in Desert Flag.


**3. With reference to bilateral military exercises involving India, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise held between India and the United States, focusing on counter-terrorism tactics.
2. Exercise Indra is a bilateral exercise between India and Russia, primarily focused on naval cooperation and joint maritime operations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise between India and the U.S., the provided text does not specify that it focuses on counter-terrorism tactics. The text only mentions that it's a joint military exercise held annually.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text mentions Exercise Indra as a bilateral exercise between India and Russia, but it does not specify that it is primarily focused on naval cooperation and joint maritime operations.  The exercise's specific focus is not detailed in the provided information.


Therefore, neither statement 1 nor statement 2 can be definitively confirmed as correct based solely on the provided text. Option (d) is the correct answer because both statements make assertions about the exercises' focus that are not explicitly supported by the given information.  The question highlights the importance of precise factual recall and avoiding assumptions based on partial information.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding India's participation in multilateral maritime exercises:**

1.  India participates in RIMPAC, the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, demonstrating its commitment to global maritime security cooperation.
2.  Exercise Orion, a multilateral maritime exercise, involves participation from India, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, and the United States, but focuses primarily on anti-piracy operations in the Mediterranean.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that RIMPAC is the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise and that India participates.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text lists Exercise Orion's participants including India and several other nations, it does *not* specify that the exercise focuses primarily on anti-piracy operations in the Mediterranean.  The statement adds a detail not supported by the provided information.


Therefore, only statement 1 is definitively correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either wrongly include or exclude statement 1 or 2 based on an unsubstantiated assertion regarding Exercise Orion's primary focus. This question tests the ability to distinguish between explicitly stated facts and implied or assumed information.


**5. With reference to India's humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Sadbhav is an annual multinational exercise involving India, the U.S., Italy, the U.K., and Seychelles, providing HADR support to affected regions.
2. Operation Sadbhav is an initiative of the Indian Army focused on civic action in regions like Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Sikkim, distinct from international HADR operations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions an "Operation Southern Readiness" as an annual multinational exercise involving India, the U.S., Italy, the U.K., and Seychelles for HADR.  It does *not* describe Operation Sadbhav in this way.  The statement conflates two distinct operations.


Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that Operation Sadbhav is an Indian Army initiative for civic action in Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Sikkim, clearly distinguishing it from international HADR efforts.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  The other options are incorrect because they either incorrectly include statement 1 or incorrectly exclude statement 2, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the distinct nature of the two operations. The question assesses the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding operations and accurately recall their specific objectives.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses solely on enhancing the resilience of critical supply chains within the Indo-Pacific region, excluding any focus on crisis response or labor rights.
2.  The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund and IPEF Accelerator are initiatives specifically designed to support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in accessing clean energy technology and integrating into global value chains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IPEF Supply Chain Council is indeed focused on strengthening critical supply chains, its mandate extends beyond mere resilience.  It also encompasses crisis response mechanisms and considerations of labor rights, as evidenced by the establishment of the Crisis Response Network and the Labor Rights Advisory Board.  The question attempts to misrepresent the scope of the Supply Chain Council by narrowing its focus.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund and IPEF Accelerator are explicitly designed to support MSMEs.  A key aspect of their support is facilitating access to clean energy technologies and assisting MSMEs in their integration into global value chains, aligning directly with the goals of the Clean Economy pillar.  The statement accurately reflects the purpose and function of these initiatives within the IPEF framework.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1.  The SCO’s cooperation programs primarily focus on economic development, with limited attention given to counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism.
2.  Belarus's accession as the tenth member state of the SCO significantly expands the organization's geographical reach into Central Asia but does not affect its existing cooperation programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SCO's agenda explicitly includes counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism as major areas of cooperation. The adoption of the Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism for 2025-2027 demonstrates a significant focus on these security issues. The statement incorrectly minimizes the SCO's commitment to counter-terrorism efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belarus's accession does indeed expand the SCO's geographical reach. However, it's inaccurate to assume that this accession has *no* impact on existing cooperation programs.  New member states often bring new perspectives, priorities, and potential collaborations, influencing the direction and implementation of existing programs.  The statement wrongly presents the accession as having no effect on the organization's internal dynamics and operational strategies.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**3. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 exclusively for infrastructure projects in African nations.
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a solely G7-led effort, excluding any participation or collaboration from other international organizations or developing countries.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII's ambition is to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure projects, but this funding is not limited to African nations. While Africa is a significant target region, the initiative aims to support developing nations globally. The statement falsely restricts the geographical scope of the PGII.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the G7 leads the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, it is not a solely G7-led effort.  Such major initiatives typically involve collaboration with other international organizations, development banks, and participating African nations.  The statement inaccurately portrays the initiative as operating in isolation from other key stakeholders.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the facts regarding the G7's initiatives.


**4.  With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is primarily intended to enhance regional connectivity within the Middle East, with minimal focus on broader global connectivity.
2.  The IMEC’s primary objective is to facilitate the movement of goods and services, with no emphasis on improving people-to-people connectivity or cultural exchange.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IMEC's stated aim is to serve as a cornerstone of *global* connectivity.  Its ambition extends beyond solely regional connectivity within the Middle East. The statement misrepresents the stated goal of the corridor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While facilitating trade and economic activity is a central aspect of the IMEC, it also implicitly promotes people-to-people connectivity and cultural exchange. Improved infrastructure and economic cooperation naturally lead to increased interaction and understanding between different societies. The statement wrongly limits the corridor's objectives to purely economic aspects.  Therefore, neither statement is a correct description of the IMEC's objectives.


**5. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  India enjoys a significant trade surplus with ASEAN member states under the AITIGA framework.
2.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting of AITIGA focused solely on resolving existing trade disputes between India and ASEAN, with no attention given to the review of the agreement itself.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This is a well-established fact. The statement presents the opposite of the reality.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting served to review the AITIGA agreement itself, in addition to addressing any trade disputes.

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing but does not consider the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2020 and has since undergone several revisions to reflect the country's evolving measures to combat financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER explicitly includes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a key area of assessment alongside money laundering and terrorist financing.  The statement omits a crucial element of the MER's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's initial MER was adopted in 2010, not 2020. While there have been subsequent updates and reviews, the initial adoption date is 2010. The statement provides an incorrect date for the initial adoption of India's MER.  Both statements contain factual inaccuracies, making neither of them correct.


**8. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, but it does not provide regional breakdowns of drug abuse patterns.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses exclusively on the illegal wildlife trade in Africa and Asia, with no coverage of other regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the UNODC report does indeed identify cannabis as the most widely abused drug, it does provide regional breakdowns of drug abuse patterns.  The statement incorrectly claims that the report lacks this crucial regional data.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, covering illegal wildlife trade across various regions, including Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world.  The statement falsely restricts the report's geographical focus.  Therefore, neither statement accurately describes the UNODC's reports.

1.  India's participation in CMF is limited to providing intelligence support, with no involvement in direct maritime operations.
2.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first counter-narcotics operation conducted by the Indian Navy since its inception, not just since joining the CMF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation in the CMF involves direct maritime operations, not just intelligence support.  The statement understates the extent of India's involvement in CMF operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first such operation *after* India joined the CMF, it was not the first counter-narcotics operation conducted by the Indian Navy. The Indian Navy has a history of conducting such operations independently. The statement incorrectly claims it was the very first operation ever conducted. Therefore, neither statement is accurate.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. The AFSPA has been permanently revoked in all regions of India where it was previously in effect.
2. The AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces, enabling them to arrest and detain individuals without warrants in designated areas.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AFSPA remains in effect in certain parts of India, although there have been efforts to reduce its scope in some areas. The statement falsely claims complete revocation of the act.

Statement 2 is correct. The AFSPA does grant broad powers to the armed forces in designated areas, including the authority to arrest and detain individuals without warrants under specific circumstances. The statement correctly identifies a key provision of the AFSPA.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IAEA's ITDB does track incidents of nuclear material theft, it's not limited to member states only.  The database encompasses reports from various sources globally, reflecting the international nature of nuclear security concerns.  The focus is on illicit trafficking, regardless of the origin or destination of the material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atoms4NetZero program specifically promotes the use of *nuclear* energy as a means to achieve net-zero emissions.  This is a controversial approach, as nuclear power generates waste products with long-term implications. However, proponents argue it is a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. The program doesn't focus on renewable sources such as solar or wind power.  The IAEA's commitment to nuclear energy is a core part of its mandate, even though it acknowledges and addresses the safety and security challenges associated with it.  The distinction between nuclear and renewable energy is crucial for understanding the IAEA’s role in the global energy landscape.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CWC entered into force in 1997, not 1992.  The delay between adoption and entry into force is common for international treaties, as it allows time for ratification by a sufficient number of states.  The exact number of member states also varies slightly depending on the source and the timing of the verification. The given number is slightly off.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrates India's commitment to the CWC, full compliance with all aspects of the convention is a complex and ongoing process.  Implementation and enforcement require sustained national efforts and international cooperation.  The act itself is a significant step, but it doesn't guarantee complete and unwavering compliance in all areas.  The ongoing nature of compliance efforts is an important consideration.


**6. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions primarily focus on the protection of combatants during armed conflict.
2. Protocol III (2005) introduced the Red Star as an additional emblem for humanitarian organizations.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 protect not only combatants, but also *non-combatants* such as civilians, prisoners of war, and the wounded and sick.  The protection of non-combatants is a central tenet of international humanitarian law and is a core component of the Geneva Conventions. The conventions aim to limit the suffering caused by war and to protect the rights of those affected, regardless of their status as combatants or non-combatants.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Protocol III (2005) introduced the *Red Crystal*, not the Red Star, as an additional emblem for humanitarian organizations.  The addition of the Red Crystal expands the range of protective symbols available, offering more options for humanitarian organizations operating in diverse contexts.  The precise identification of the additional emblem is crucial for understanding the conventions' protective mechanisms.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC aims for the complete destruction of chemical weapons, the timeframe for destruction isn't universally fixed; it depends on various factors including the size and nature of a nation's stockpile.  The convention allows for flexibility in implementation schedules based on individual circumstances and capabilities.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The CWC does indeed have a strong verification regime, including on-site inspections of declared facilities. However,  the scope of inspections is not limited to military-related facilities.  The CWC also includes provisions for inspections of chemical industries that could potentially be used for the production of chemical weapons, thereby addressing the potential for diversion of materials.  The exclusion of entirely unrelated private sector industries is not explicitly stated in the CWC and is an oversimplification.

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), first adopted in 2010, assesses its compliance with FATF recommendations only concerning money laundering, excluding terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is solely responsible for collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to money laundering, without any jurisdiction over terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's MER, while first adopted in 2010 and updated periodically, comprehensively assesses its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These are all core elements of FATF standards.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FIU-IND's mandate extends beyond just money laundering. It plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to both money laundering and terrorist financing, facilitating investigations and prosecutions of financial crimes.  Its scope is not limited to a single type of financial crime.


**4. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions exclusively focus on protecting combatants during wartime, neglecting the protection of civilians or non-combatants.
2.  Protocol III (2005) to the Geneva Conventions introduced the Red Crystal as an additional emblem for humanitarian organizations, replacing the existing Red Cross and Red Crescent emblems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions are fundamentally concerned with protecting both combatants and non-combatants during armed conflict.  The four Conventions address the protection of wounded and sick soldiers, shipwrecked personnel, prisoners of war, and civilians in occupied territories.  The protection of civilians is a central element of the Conventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Protocol III introduced the Red Crystal as an *additional* emblem, not a replacement. The Red Cross, Red Crescent, and Red Crystal emblems now co-exist, all offering protection under International Humanitarian Law.  The existing emblems remain valid and in use.

2. The Act defines an ISO as exclusively comprising personnel from the three armed forces (Army, Navy, and Air Force), excluding any civilian staff or personnel from other government agencies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act does grant significant disciplinary and administrative powers to the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs, these powers are not absolute or unchallengeable.  There are existing legal frameworks and mechanisms for appeal or review within the military justice system.  The Act clarifies and strengthens existing command structures, not creates unchecked authority.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of an ISO in the Act is not limited solely to personnel from the three armed forces.  It can include personnel subject to any two or all three of the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957.  This suggests that the inclusion of personnel from other government agencies or civilian staff under specific conditions is possible.



**6. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 1999 based on recommendations from a task force headed by K.C. Pant, and reports directly to the President of India.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), is solely responsible for formulating short-term national security policies, with the Strategic Policy Group (SPG) focusing on long-term strategic planning.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The NSCS was indeed established in 1999 based on the K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations. However, it doesn't report directly to the President; it functions under the National Security Council (NSC), which is headed by the Prime Minister.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB's role is primarily focused on long-term strategic analysis and policy recommendations.  The SPG, also headed by the NSA, is responsible for coordinating national security policies across different government ministries.  Their responsibilities are not strictly divided into short-term vs. long-term planning as described.

1. Operation Safed Sagar, conducted by the Indian Air Force, exclusively targeted Pakistani military installations located in densely populated areas to maximize the impact on civilian infrastructure.
2. Operation Talwar, launched by the Indian Navy, involved a complete naval blockade of all Pakistani ports, severely disrupting Pakistan's international trade and economic activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar targeted Pakistani military positions in Kargil, but the operations were carefully planned to minimize civilian casualties.  The Indian Air Force prioritized precision strikes to avoid collateral damage. Targeting civilian infrastructure was not the objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval deployment designed to deter any Pakistani naval action and to secure India's maritime interests.  It did not involve a complete blockade of all Pakistani ports. A complete blockade would have had major international repercussions and was not the strategy.


**8. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly permits the deployment of conventional weapons in space, provided they are not weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).
2.  Militarization of space refers solely to the placement of weapons in space, excluding any other military use of space-based assets or technologies.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chloropicrin can be used as a chemical warfare agent, it also has legitimate uses as a broad-spectrum fumigant, pesticide, and nematicide.  The CWC regulates its use in warfare but doesn't prohibit all uses.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of certain asphyxiating, poisonous, or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials, or devices in war. Chloropicrin falls under this category but its use in other non-warfare contexts is not explicitly prohibited by the Geneva Protocol.  The CWC deals with the more specific regulation of its use in warfare.


**10. With reference to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that Cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with the highest rates of abuse concentrated solely in the "Golden Triangle" region.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 exclusively focuses on illegal wildlife trade related to endangered species, excluding any analysis of illegal timber trade or other forms of environmental crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNODC report does highlight Cannabis as the most widely abused drug, it does not confine the highest rates of abuse to the "Golden Triangle" region.  The report provides a global overview of drug abuse patterns, identifying multiple regions and countries with significant issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses on illegal wildlife trade, it also addresses other interconnected forms of environmental crime, including illegal logging and timber trafficking.  The report recognizes the links between various forms of environmental crime and their impacts.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proposed India-Bangladesh electricity corridor is intended to facilitate electricity trade *between India and Bangladesh*, not within India itself (Katihar to Bornagar).  The statement incorrectly implies an internal Indian project.  The actual purpose is to enhance energy connectivity between the two countries, and the mentioned locations represent the points of connection for this cross-border initiative.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports *petroleum products* (not crude oil) from Motihari in India to Amlekhganj in Nepal.  The pipeline is crucial for supplying petroleum products to Nepal and reducing its reliance on other sources.  The statement's inaccuracy concerning the type of product transported misrepresents the pipeline's purpose and function.


**4. With reference to the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004 as a primary institution responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER process accurately assesses a country's efforts in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The timeline provided for India's first MER adoption is also accurate, highlighting the ongoing commitment to international standards in these crucial areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The TAPI pipeline's route does not pass through Iran.  It traverses Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, and Pakistan before reaching India. The deliberate inclusion of Iran alters the pipeline's actual route, creating a misleading statement.


**13. With reference to the Colombo Process, consider the following statements:**

1. The Colombo Process is an intergovernmental initiative focused on addressing irregular migration in the Indian Ocean Region.
2. India recently assumed the chairmanship of the Colombo Process, succeeding Sri Lanka.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Colombo Process is an intergovernmental consultative process aimed at addressing the issue of irregular migration in the Indian Ocean Region.  It focuses on regional cooperation to address this complex humanitarian issue.

Statement 2 is correct. India recently took over the chairmanship of the Colombo Process, continuing the regional cooperation efforts to manage migration flows in the Indian Ocean region.  This highlights India's increasing role in regional governance.


**14. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI 2024 was released by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a US-based non-governmental organization.
2.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 reflects concerns about press freedom and the safety of journalists in the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WPFI 2024 was released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based NGO, not the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).  Confusing these two prominent organizations involved in press freedom advocacy creates a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 does indicate concerns regarding press freedom and the challenges faced by journalists in the country.  This is a significant indicator of the state of media freedom and civil liberties.



**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of measures to combat cybercrime.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework used in India's anti-money laundering efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the FATF's MER does assess a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's inaccurate to say it *excludes* cybercrime entirely.  The FATF's mandate is broad and evolving, and while it may not have a dedicated section specifically labeled "cybercrime," the organization increasingly acknowledges the links between cybercrime and other financial crimes, such as money laundering.  Therefore, indirectly, aspects of cybercrime related to these core areas are likely considered.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and that the PMLA, 2002, is a crucial part of India's legislative framework for combating money laundering.  This is a verifiable fact based on the source material.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 identified cocaine as the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a major region affected by illicit wildlife trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report, as per the provided text, clearly states that Cannabis is the most abused drug globally, not cocaine.  This is a direct contradiction of the statement. The order of other drugs mentioned may or may not be accurate but the most important fact that Cannabis is the most abused drug is clearly mentioned in the text.

Statement 2 is correct. The source material explicitly identifies the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle")—comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand—as a significant region impacted by illicit wildlife trafficking, as highlighted in the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024. This is a directly verifiable fact from the given text.


**3.  With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives involved calls for the withdrawal of Indian economic aid and development projects, reflecting a shift towards pro-China policies.
2.  India's initiatives to strengthen ties with the Maldives include the construction of a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll and the provision of grants for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives primarily focused on the withdrawal of Indian *military* personnel, not economic aid and development projects.  While there might have been some anti-India sentiment related to economic aspects, the core of the campaign centered on the military presence.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the campaign.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions India's construction of a new Coast Guard base at UTF atoll and the provision of grants for HICDPs as key initiatives to bolster relations with the Maldives. These are verifiable facts from the provided source.



**4. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA, signed in 2009, aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India, resulting in a trade surplus for India.
2. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA recently reviewed the agreement's effectiveness in promoting balanced trade between ASEAN and India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties, the text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This directly refutes the claim in statement 1.

Statement 2 is correct. The provided text mentions the recent 5th Joint Committee Meeting in Jakarta, which reviewed AITIGA's performance in reducing trade barriers and fostering stronger economic links between ASEAN and India.  This is a direct and verifiable fact from the given source.


**5. With reference to Currency Swap Agreements (CSAs), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's CSA with Japan amounts to $50 billion, while the CSA with Sri Lanka is a smaller agreement.
2. The RBI's announcement of a SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 aims to facilitate regional trade and financial stability within the SAARC region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions India's bilateral CSA with Japan as amounting to $75 billion, not $50 billion.  This is a factual error within the statement.  The relative size of the CSA with Sri Lanka is not directly contradicted but the incorrect figure for the Japan CSA makes the entire statement wrong.

Statement 2 is correct.  The source material explicitly states that the RBI announced a SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027. The purpose, as implied, is to promote regional trade and financial stability within the SAARC framework. This is a verifiable fact from the given text.


**6. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported over 200 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023, involving more than 40 states.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to enhance global food security, while Atoms4NetZero focuses on promoting renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the ITDB reported 168 incidents, not over 200, involving 31 states, not more than 40.  The statement contains multiple factual inaccuracies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Atoms4Food correctly uses nuclear techniques to improve food security, the description of Atoms4NetZero is inaccurate.  Atoms4NetZero promotes *nuclear energy*, not renewable energy sources, to help achieve net-zero emissions. This is a key difference that makes the statement incorrect.


**7. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 categorized India among the "developing" countries (Tier 3), indicating a moderate commitment to cybersecurity pillars.
2. The GCI 2024 assessment includes an evaluation of countries' expansion of digital services as a factor in their overall cybersecurity posture.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly places India among the "role modelling" countries (Tier 1), not the "developing" countries (Tier 3). This is a direct contradiction of the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions that the GCI 2024 assesses countries' commitment to cybersecurity, and that most countries are either "establishing" or "evolving" in their digital service expansion. This implies that the expansion of digital services is a factor considered in the overall assessment.


**8. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Australian Government's National Defense Strategy (NDS) 2024 identifies India as a "key security partner" in the Indo-Pacific Region (IPR), but stops short of designating India as a "top-tier" partner.
2.  India and Australia's cooperation includes participation in the QUAD partnership, the signing of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2020, and the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Australia's NDS 2024 identifies India as a "top-tier security partner," not just a "key security partner." This is a direct contradiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The text confirms India and Australia's cooperation through QUAD, the CSP (signed in 2020), and the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (signed in 2022).  These are all verifiable facts from the source.


**9. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), consider the following statements:**

1. IPOI, launched by India in 2019, is a treaty-based agreement focused on maritime security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. IPOI's philosophy builds upon India's 'Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)' initiative, which emphasizes inclusive development and adherence to international maritime laws.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that IPOI is a *non-treaty-based* voluntary arrangement, not a treaty-based agreement.  The statement incorrectly characterizes the nature of the initiative.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly explains that IPOI's philosophy is based on India's SAGAR initiative, which promotes inclusive development and respect for international maritime laws.  This is a direct and verifiable point from the source.


**10. With reference to the India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the 17th SOSA partner of the US, and the agreement is legally binding.
2.  Key milestones in India-US defense cooperation include the designation of India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016 and the establishment of the India-US Trade Policy Forum in 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that India is the 18th, not 17th, SOSA partner, and importantly, that the agreement is *legally non-binding*, contrary to the statement's claim.

Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning the Major Defence Partner designation in 2016. However,  while the India-US Trade Policy Forum was indeed established in 2005, the statement incorrectly links it to defense cooperation; it's primarily a trade-focused initiative.  The combination of a partially correct and a partially incorrect element makes the statement as a whole incorrect.



**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is situated in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is the largest permanent desert lake globally.
2.  The Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the primary water source for Lake Turkana.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia,  it's described as the largest *permanent desert and alkaline* lake, not simply the largest permanent desert lake.  The distinction is crucial; many lakes in deserts exist temporarily.  The phrasing in statement 1 is therefore misleading and not entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River, flowing from Ethiopia, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.  This is a well-established geographical fact.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The slight inaccuracy in statement 1, while seemingly minor, makes it unsuitable as a completely correct statement in a UPSC-style MCQ that demands precision.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Kenya, known for its significant height and status as a free-standing mountain.
2.  The Uhuru Summit is the highest peak of Mount Kilimanjaro, and it is part of a larger mountain range.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, Mount Kilimanjaro is situated in Tanzania, not Kenya. Secondly, while it is indeed a stratovolcano and a free-standing mountain (not part of a range), the description omits its crucial status as the highest peak in Africa. This omission makes the statement incomplete and technically incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Uhuru Peak is indeed the highest point of Mount Kilimanjaro, but the statement wrongly claims it's part of a mountain range. Kilimanjaro is explicitly described as a *free-standing* mountain.

Thus, both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct option. The question tests not only knowledge of Kilimanjaro's location but also its unique geological characteristics.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, and is crucial for reducing travel time to the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.
2.  Indian traders have recently demanded the reopening of the Lipulekh Pass border trade route with Nepal, which was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Lipulekh Pass is indeed situated near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal (not Bhutan).  It significantly shortens the pilgrimage route to Kailash Mansarovar. While the phrasing could be more precise regarding the "tri-junction," the core information is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The demand for reopening the Lipulekh Pass border trade route is directed towards China, not Nepal.  The passage explicitly states that trade with *China* through the pass is being sought.  Confusing Nepal with China is a key distractor in this MCQ.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, leading to option (a) as the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the geopolitical significance of the Lipulekh Pass and its location.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal, located in Egypt, serves as the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe, and recently witnessed a shift in India's fuel exports to Europe towards the Cape of Good Hope route.
2.  Due to geopolitical tensions, India has permanently shifted its fuel exports from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route to avoid transit through the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Suez Canal is indeed the shortest shipping route between Asia and Europe. The text mentions a shift in India's fuel exports to Europe, using the Cape of Good Hope route. This shift, however, is not presented as permanent but rather as a temporary change due to unspecified circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage does not state that the shift to the Cape of Good Hope route is permanent.  It only highlights a temporary change, implying that the Suez Canal route might be used again in the future.  The statement wrongly infers permanence.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, resulting in (a) being the correct answer. The question assesses knowledge of the Suez Canal's importance in global trade and recent shifts in shipping patterns.


**5. With reference to the Galkynysh gas field, consider the following statements:**

1. The Galkynysh gas field, located in southeastern Turkmenistan, is one of the world's five largest gas fields and is the source of natural gas for the TAPI pipeline project.
2.  The TAPI gas pipeline project, spanning approximately 1,500 km, transports natural gas from the Galkynysh field to Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Galkynysh gas field is accurately described as one of the world's five largest, located in southeastern Turkmenistan, and serving as the source of gas for the TAPI pipeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the pipeline's length.  The passage clearly states that the TAPI pipeline spans approximately 1,800 km, not 1,500 km. This discrepancy, though seemingly minor, makes the statement factually inaccurate for a UPSC-level question.

Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate, making (a) the correct choice.  The question tests knowledge of major gas fields and their role in international energy projects.



**6.  With reference to the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, consider the following statements:**

1. The TAPI pipeline project, inaugurated recently by officials from Afghanistan and Turkmenistan, aims to transport natural gas from the Galkynysh gas field in northeastern Turkmenistan to India.
2.  The TAPI pipeline project, initially conceived in the mid-1990s, has faced significant delays due to geopolitical instability in the region, particularly in Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The TAPI pipeline project was indeed inaugurated recently by Afghan and Turkmen officials.  The source of gas is the Galkynysh field in southeastern Turkmenistan (not northeastern).  The minor geographical inaccuracy is a distractor.  The pipeline's destination includes India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The project, conceived in the mid-1990s, has encountered significant delays due to political instability in the region, particularly in Afghanistan. This is a widely acknowledged fact.

Therefore, both statements are substantially correct, even with the minor geographical error in statement 1.  Option (c) is thus the best answer. The question tests awareness of major energy projects and their geopolitical context.


**7. With reference to the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Switzerland maintains a series of bilateral agreements with the European Union (EU), unlike Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway, which participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).
2.  India's trade deficit with EFTA member countries is primarily due to significant imports of oil and petroleum products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  It accurately describes the different relationships between EFTA members and the EU.  Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway participate in the EEA, granting them access to the EU's single market.  Switzerland, however, has a different arrangement based on bilateral agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage clearly states that India's trade deficit with Switzerland (the largest EFTA trading partner) is due to *gold* imports, not oil and petroleum products. This substitution of "gold" with "oil and petroleum products" is a crucial distractor.

Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate, making (a) the correct option.  The question evaluates understanding of international trade relationships and the specific details of EFTA-EU interactions.


**8. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1. TEPA marks India's first free trade agreement (FTA) with EFTA members, aiming to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) by $150 billion and create 1 million jobs in India.
2.  TEPA includes Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) in professional services, such as nursing and architecture, and eliminates tariffs on 90% of India's tariff lines, covering 98% of India’s exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While TEPA is indeed India's first FTA with EFTA, the FDI target is stated as $100 billion, not $150 billion.  The job creation target of 1 million is correct. The slight numerical discrepancy in the FDI figure is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. TEPA eliminates tariffs on 92.2% of its tariff lines, covering 99.6% of India's exports—not 90% and 98%, respectively. The minor differences in percentages are deliberately designed to mislead.

Both statements contain numerical inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.  The question tests attention to detail and the ability to identify minor but significant discrepancies in data.


**9. With reference to the Path to Peace Summit in Ukraine, consider the following statements:**

1. The summit aimed to establish a common understanding of a path towards a just and lasting peace in Ukraine, and India signed the joint communique released at the summit, expressing its support for the negotiated settlement.
2.  India's participation in the summit involved the attendance of the Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs, reflecting India's commitment to a peaceful resolution of the conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that India *abstained* from signing the joint communique, advocating for dialogue between conflicting parties instead of outright support for a specific negotiated settlement.  The statement misrepresents India's position.

Statement 2 is correct. The Secretary of the Ministry of External Affairs did attend the summit, demonstrating India's engagement in the peace process.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The question tests understanding of India's foreign policy stance on the Ukraine conflict and its participation in international diplomatic efforts.


**10. With reference to MERCOSUR, consider the following statements:**

1. Bolivia recently became a full member of MERCOSUR, expanding the bloc's geographical reach and economic influence in South America.
2.  MERCOSUR primarily focuses on promoting economic cooperation and integration among its member states, with a secondary emphasis on political and security issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bolivia's recent accession to MERCOSUR is accurately reported in the provided text.

Statement 2 is also essentially correct. While MERCOSUR's primary focus is economic cooperation, it implicitly involves some degree of political and security coordination among its members.  The statement's phrasing of "secondary emphasis" is acceptable given the primarily economic nature of the organization.

Therefore, both statements are largely accurate, leading to (c) as the correct answer.  The question assesses knowledge of regional economic blocs and their functions.


**11. With reference to the Colombo Process, consider the following statements:**

1. India recently chaired its first meeting as the Chair of the Colombo Process, showcasing India's increased engagement in regional cooperation initiatives in South Asia.
2. The Colombo Process primarily addresses issues related to migration and refugee movements in the Indian Ocean region, with a focus on humanitarian assistance and international cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process.

Statement 2 is too broad and potentially misleading. While the Colombo Process does relate to migration and refugee issues, the passage doesn't define its scope that comprehensively. The statement is not entirely incorrect but it lacks the precision needed for a UPSC-style MCQ and is therefore not a completely accurate statement.

Therefore, only statement 1 is definitively correct, making (a) the appropriate answer.  The question tests knowledge of regional cooperation mechanisms in South Asia.



**12. With reference to the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC), consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh recently joined the CSC as its fifth member, expanding the scope of security cooperation among South Asian countries.
2. The CSC primarily focuses on counter-terrorism and transnational crime, with a secondary focus on issues related to maritime security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct and accurately reflects the information provided in the source.

Statement 2 is too broad and not fully supported by the provided text. While counter-terrorism and transnational crime are likely elements of the CSC's agenda, the passage does not specify the precise priorities or the relative importance of different security concerns. The statement is therefore not a completely accurate description of CSC.

Thus, only statement 1 is completely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The question assesses knowledge of regional security cooperation initiatives.


**13. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. India ranked 160th among 180 countries in the WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), indicating concerns about press freedom in the country.
2.  The WPFI 2024 was published on World Press Freedom Day (3 May) and had the theme: “A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis”.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding India's ranking. The passage states India ranked 159th, not 160th.  This minor numerical difference is a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The WPFI 2024's release date and theme are accurately described in the text.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, resulting in (b) as the correct answer.  The question tests knowledge of global press freedom rankings and their significance.


**14. With reference to the World Bank's Global Employment Trends for Youth (GET for Youth) Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The GET for Youth Report is an annual publication that provides a comprehensive overview of global youth employment trends, including data on unemployment, underemployment, and working conditions.
2.  The recent GET for Youth Report highlighted the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on youth employment globally, particularly in developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is generally correct. The passage mentions the GET for Youth Report's release by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), not the World Bank.  The statement's mention of "working conditions" is not explicitly mentioned in the source, but is a reasonable assumption given the report's probable content.

Statement 2 is not explicitly stated or implied by the provided text. While it's plausible that the report addresses the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on youth employment, the passage does not confirm this.

Therefore, only statement 1 is sufficiently supported by the passage, making (a) the correct option.  The question tests knowledge of major reports on youth employment and their focus.


**15. With reference to Ahimsa Silk, consider the following statements:**

1. Ahimsa silk is produced without harming the silk moth, and it is derived from the silkworm Antheraea assamensis, a species known for its high-quality silk production.
2.  The silkworm Philosamia ricini, used in Ahimsa silk production, is multivoltine, allowing for multiple rearing cycles per year, contributing to the sustainability of Ahimsa silk farming.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ahimsa silk is indeed produced without harming the silk moth, the passage states it's derived from *Philosamia ricini*, not *Antheraea assamensis*. The substitution of silkworm species is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage correctly identifies *Philosamia ricini* as a multivoltine silkworm, enabling multiple rearing cycles and contributing to the sustainability of Ahimsa silk production.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The question tests knowledge of sustainable silk production methods and the specific species involved.



**16. With reference to the National Film Awards, consider the following statements:**

1. The National Film Awards are presented annually in three sections: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and Best Writing on Cinema.
2.  Established in 1954, the National Film Awards were initially known as the "State Awards."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The passage mentions three sections: Feature Films, Non-Feature Films, and a third section related to writing about cinema (not necessarily "Best Writing on Cinema"). The minor difference in phrasing is a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect about the establishment year and initial name. The passage doesn't provide the exact establishment year, but it does state the awards were not initially called "State Awards."

Therefore, only statement 1 is sufficiently accurate, making (a) the correct answer.  The question tests factual knowledge about the National Film Awards.


**17. With reference to Foster Care in India, consider the following statements:**

1. Children eligible for foster care in India are typically below the age of 10 years, and priority is given to placing children with relatives or extended family members.
2. Single individuals can be eligible to become foster parents in India, provided they meet specific criteria set by the relevant child welfare authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage does not specify an upper age limit for children eligible for foster care, and while placing children with relatives is preferred, the statement is too general to be considered entirely true.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage does not explicitly exclude single individuals from becoming foster parents.  It implies that eligibility is determined by criteria set by child welfare authorities, and these criteria may or may not include marital status.

Therefore, only statement 2 can be considered largely accurate, making (b) the correct answer. The question tests knowledge of foster care policies in India.


**18. With reference to Zoopharmacognosy, consider the following statements:**

1. Zoopharmacognosy is the study of how animals use medicinal plants and other substances for self-medication and is often observed in primates and other intelligent animals.
2.  Zoopharmacognosy research has led to the discovery of several new drugs derived from animal-produced substances, such as venoms and toxins.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The definition of zoopharmacognosy provided is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage does not suggest that zoopharmacognosy research has directly led to the discovery of new drugs from animal substances. While it's possible that animal-derived substances have been studied independently, the statement creates an incorrect link between zoopharmacognosy and drug discovery.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer. The question tests knowledge of zoopharmacognosy and its scope.


**19. With reference to Euthanasia, consider the following statements:**

1. Active euthanasia involves the intentional act of ending a person's life to relieve suffering, and it is legal in several countries, but not in India.
2.  The Aruna Shanbaug case in India highlighted the issue of the right to die with dignity and played a significant role in shaping the legal and ethical discourse surrounding euthanasia in the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The definition of active euthanasia is accurate, and the statement correctly notes its legal status in various countries, contrasting it with India's legal position.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The Aruna Shanbaug case significantly influenced the debate on euthanasia and the right to die with dignity in India.

Therefore, both statements are correct, making (c) the correct answer. The question tests knowledge of the legal and ethical aspects of euthanasia.


**20. With reference to the Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar, consider the following statements:**

1. The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar is awarded annually to recognize outstanding contributions in various fields of science and technology, and the awardees are selected by a committee chaired by the President of India.
2.  The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar includes a cash component, in addition to a medal and certificate, to acknowledge the recipients' significant achievements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The passage indicates the awards are for science and technology contributions, but it states the selection committee is chaired by the Principal Scientific Advisor, not the President of India. This difference in the chair of the committee is a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage doesn't mention a cash component.

Therefore, only a modified version of statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the best answer. The question tests knowledge of science awards in India.


**21. With reference to the Central Banker Report Cards 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The Central Banker Report Cards 2024 assesses the performance of central banks globally based on various macroeconomic indicators, including inflation, economic growth, and financial stability.
2.  The report cards are published annually by an independent think tank, and they provide a comparative analysis of central bank policies and their effectiveness.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The provided text does not give information about the Central Banker Report Cards 2024. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the correctness of either statement.  However, statement 1 is a reasonable assumption about the likely content of such a report.  Statement 2 is less certain.  Without additional information, we cannot confirm the publisher or the level of detail in the report.  Therefore, in the absence of information, (a) is the most plausible answer based on general knowledge of such reports.  This question highlights the importance of verifying information from reliable sources.




**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybersecurity threats.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key Indian institutions involved in combating money laundering, established in 2004 and 1956 respectively.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybersecurity is a growing concern related to financial crime, it's not currently a primary focus of the standard MER process.  The scope of the MER is clearly defined and doesn't include a broad range of potential threats beyond these three core areas.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to money laundering and other financial crimes. The ED, established much earlier in 1956, is primarily responsible for enforcing economic laws and regulations, including those relating to money laundering. Both institutions are integral parts of India's anti-money laundering framework.  The dates of establishment are accurately stated.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand as a significant region affected by drug trafficking and wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. According to the UNODC's World Drug Day report, cannabis is the most widely abused drug globally.  The statement incorrectly places cocaine as the most abused substance, reversing the actual order. This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding UNODC findings.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC reports do indeed identify the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle")—comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand—as a region significantly impacted by drug production and trafficking, often linked to wildlife crime. The report details the complex interplay between these criminal activities in the region, making it a key area of concern for international agencies.


**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported over 200 incidents of nuclear material theft by more than 40 states in 2023.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses on promoting nuclear energy to help achieve net-zero emissions, while its Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve global food security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IAEA's ITDB does track incidents of nuclear material theft, the reported number of incidents in 2023 was 168, involving 31 states, not over 200 incidents and more than 40 states.  This demonstrates the need for precise recall of numerical data from the IAEA reports. The inflated figures in the statement serve as a strong distractor.


Statement 2 is correct. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative explicitly aims to promote the role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions targets, while Atoms4Food leverages nuclear technologies to enhance food production and address global food security challenges.  Both programs represent significant aspects of the IAEA's work beyond its nuclear safety and security mandate.


**4. With reference to India's participation in international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India was elected as a member of the steering committee of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network and is also a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India's Department of Posts released commemorative postage stamps to mark the 170th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and the 150th anniversary of India Post.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's election to the GlobE network steering committee reflects its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.  India's membership in SAWEN demonstrates its participation in regional wildlife conservation and enforcement initiatives.  Both points accurately reflect India's involvement in these specific international collaborations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's Department of Posts did release commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of the UPU, the statement incorrectly attributes a 170th-anniversary celebration to India Post itself.  India Post's actual anniversary is 170 years, but the statement incorrectly links this to the UPU. The detail about the anniversary years is crucial and serves as a strong distractor.


**5. With reference to India's bilateral and multilateral engagements, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) acquired legal personality after Nepal ratified the BIMSTEC charter, bringing the total number of ratifying states to seven.  The  "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership is a key initiative under the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad).
2.  India is a signatory to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, but it has not ratified the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC).  India's participation in the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy was as an Outreach Country.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter was indeed the final step in completing the ratification process by all member states, giving BIMSTEC legal personality. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" is a genuine collaborative initiative under the Quad framework.

Statement 2 is also correct. India is a signatory to both the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention.  However, India has not yet ratified the Rome Statute of the ICC.  India's participation in the G7 summit as an Outreach Country is accurately stated.  The statement cleverly combines accurate and inaccurate information regarding India's participation in international agreements to create a challenging question.


**1. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) primarily focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit trafficking of nuclear materials, commencing its operations in 1995.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program is dedicated to promoting renewable energy sources to mitigate climate change and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IAEA's ITDB indeed monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking, starting in 1995.  This database is a crucial tool in preventing the proliferation of nuclear materials and enhancing global security.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses on promoting *nuclear* energy as a means to achieve net-zero emissions, not renewable energy sources.  Nuclear power plants, while producing low-carbon electricity, are still a source of some waste and pose other safety concerns. The program aims to leverage nuclear technology for a low-carbon energy future, a different approach from solely relying on renewable sources.  The confusion might arise from the general association of "net-zero" with renewable energy, but Atoms4NetZero specifically targets the role of nuclear power.


**2. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments, ranking nations based on their adherence to five core cybersecurity pillars.
2. In the 2024 GCI, India was categorized as a "developing" nation, indicating a moderate level of commitment to cybersecurity best practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The ITU's GCI 2024 does evaluate national cybersecurity efforts across five key areas.  The index provides a framework for assessing a country's preparedness and commitment to securing its cyberspace.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India was actually placed among the "role model" countries (Tier 1) in the 2024 GCI, demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity. The statement incorrectly categorizes India's ranking, potentially confusing it with the larger number of nations in lower tiers.  The assessment of India's cybersecurity posture is significantly higher than what is presented in statement 2.


**3. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda, a drug seizure operation under CMF's Combined Task Force-150, marked India's first such operation since joining the CMF in 2023.
2. The CMF is a multinational coalition focused solely on counter-terrorism operations in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2023, and Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first such operation undertaken by the Indian Navy within the CMF framework.  The timeline of India's CMF membership is off by one year.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While counter-terrorism is a significant aspect of the CMF's mandate, its activities extend beyond this to encompass a broader range of maritime security operations, including counter-piracy and drug interdiction, such as Operation Crimson Barracuda. The statement oversimplifies the CMF's diverse operational scope.


**4. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1.  India was elected as the Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2. The agreement established a Crisis Response Network to facilitate coordinated responses to disruptions in regional supply chains, but excludes mechanisms for addressing labor rights issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India was elected as the *Vice-Chair*, not the Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.  This subtle difference in the position held significantly alters the statement's accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement explicitly includes a Labor Rights Advisory Board alongside the Crisis Response Network. This board is designed to address labor rights concerns and promote workforce development within the regional supply chains.  The statement wrongly omits a key component of the agreement's structure.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India and the Middle East, with minimal emphasis on European integration.
2.  The IMEC was proposed as a crucial component of global connectivity initiatives, aiming to facilitate trade and investment flows across a vast geographical area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMEC connects India and the Middle East, a key aspect of its design is to foster stronger economic ties with Europe, creating a significant trans-continental corridor for trade and investment. The statement underplays the corridor's European dimension.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IMEC's conceptualization highlights its role in bolstering global connectivity by facilitating trade, investment, and people-to-people exchanges across a wide geographical range. This vision positions the corridor as a vital element in strengthening international economic cooperation.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The 24th SCO summit resulted in the addition of Belarus as the 10th member state, significantly expanding the organization's geographical reach.
2.  The SCO's focus is primarily limited to security cooperation, with minimal emphasis on economic or cultural initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Belarus did join the SCO at the 24th summit, marking a significant expansion of the organization's membership and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While security cooperation remains a key pillar of the SCO, the organization is increasingly active in promoting economic and cultural exchange among its members.  Initiatives such as the BRICS Grain Exchange (though not directly SCO-led, it reflects the broader trend) and various collaborative projects across multiple sectors demonstrate a broader focus than solely security.  The statement ignores the organization's multi-faceted agenda.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in the 50th G7 summit was as a permanent member, reflecting its growing global influence.
2.  The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is focused on funding infrastructure projects in developed nations to boost their economic growth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation in the G7 summit was as an *invited outreach country*, not as a permanent member.  The G7 has a fixed membership, and India's involvement was on an ad-hoc basis for that particular summit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII's primary goal is to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* nations, aiming to support their economic development and reduce reliance on unsustainable infrastructure practices.  The statement misrepresents the target recipients of PGII funding.


**8. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India, adopted in 2024, assessed its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2004 and this 2024 MER is a routine periodic review of its compliance with international standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER does assess a country's compliance with international standards in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  This is a core function of the FATF.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the FATF does conduct periodic reviews, India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2004. The statement contains an inaccurate timeline for the initial evaluation, creating a plausible but ultimately incorrect answer.  The 2024 review builds upon previous assessments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UNODC report does identify cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, with opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy following in prevalence. This reflects global drug usage patterns.

Statement 2 is also correct. The report indeed highlights both the "Death Triangle" (formerly the Golden Triangle) and the "Death Crescent" (formerly the Golden Crescent) as significant regions impacted by drug production and trafficking.  These regions are known for their historical involvement in the global drug trade and remain areas of concern.


**10. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The 33rd session of the CCPCJ launched the "Generation Justice" initiative to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice reform but did not address transnational organized crime.
2.  India is a signatory to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, and actively participates in regional initiatives to combat transnational crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 33rd session of the CCPCJ specifically *did* call for steps to combat transnational organized crime (TOC) alongside the launch of the Generation Justice initiative. The statement omits a key focus of the session.

Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed a signatory to the UNTOC and actively engages in regional and international efforts to combat transnational organized crime.  This reflects India's commitment to international cooperation in tackling this issue.


**11. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

1. India's recent election to the GlobE steering committee reflects its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.
2. The GlobE network focuses exclusively on domestic anti-corruption strategies within member countries, without addressing cross-border issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's election to the GlobE steering committee demonstrates its commitment to strengthening international cooperation in combating corruption. This is a significant step in promoting global anti-corruption initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GlobE network actively addresses cross-border corruption issues, recognizing the transnational nature of many corrupt activities.  Its mandate extends beyond solely domestic anti-corruption efforts.  The statement misrepresents the network's scope and objectives.


**12. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports electricity from India to Bangladesh to address its energy deficit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, though not necessarily the largest in Asia.  The statement accurately reflects the significant trade relationship between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports *natural gas*, not electricity.  The statement incorrectly identifies the commodity being transported through the pipeline, potentially confusing it with other India-Bangladesh energy cooperation projects.


**13. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade, but the agreement excludes Bhutan.
2.  India's cross-border energy projects with Bhutan include the Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydropower projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**14. With reference to the G4 nations and the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, consider the following statements:**

1.  The G4 nations comprise Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, advocating for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2. The UfC group, also known as the "Coffee Club," actively supports the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council membership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The G4 nations are indeed Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, and they are actively seeking permanent seats on the UN Security Council.  This accurately represents the composition and aim of the G4.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UfC group *opposes* the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council seats.  The statement misrepresents the UfC's stance on the issue.  The UfC seeks a broader reform of the UNSC rather than supporting the G4's specific proposal.


**15. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICC's jurisdiction extends to prosecuting individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but excludes crimes committed by heads of state.
2.  In March 2023, the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Russia's President, demonstrating the court's potential reach and impact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC's jurisdiction applies to individuals regardless of their official position, including heads of state.  The principle of immunity for heads of state does not apply within the ICC's framework. The statement wrongly implies a limitation on the court's jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The ICC did issue an arrest warrant against Russia's President in March 2023, demonstrating the court's ability to pursue cases against high-profile individuals. This highlights the court's potential impact on international relations.

**17. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. SAARC has been largely inactive since 2016 due to persistent political tensions among member states.
2.  SAARC's primary focus is on promoting economic cooperation among its member states, with minimal emphasis on social or cultural initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

2.  Several major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, such as Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu, are constructed by India and supply electricity to India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline connects India and Nepal, not India and Bangladesh. This pipeline facilitates the transportation of petroleum products between the two countries, enhancing energy security for Nepal.  Statement 2 is correct.  Several major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, including Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu, are indeed constructed with Indian participation and supply a significant amount of electricity to India. These projects are examples of successful cross-border energy cooperation between India and Bhutan. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the India-Maldives relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and the Maldives focuses primarily on economic cooperation, neglecting the crucial aspect of maritime security.
2.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project, a major infrastructure initiative in the Maldives, is solely funded and implemented by the Maldivian government, showcasing its independent development capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and the Maldives explicitly addresses both economic and maritime security aspects.  The partnership aims to strengthen cooperation in areas such as trade, investment, and maritime security. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project, while a major infrastructure development for the Maldives, is significantly supported and developed by India, not solely by the Maldivian government.  India's substantial involvement demonstrates a key aspect of bilateral cooperation. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the geographical features of Bangladesh:**

1.  Bangladesh shares its boundaries with five Indian states: West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, excluding Sikkim.
2. The Jamuna River, a major waterway in Bangladesh, is a tributary of the Ganges River, not the Brahmaputra.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh does share its boundaries with five Indian states: West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram. Sikkim is not a bordering state. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Jamuna River in Bangladesh is part of the Brahmaputra River system, not the Ganges.  The Brahmaputra River, after entering Bangladesh, is known as the Jamuna River.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**8. With reference to the Colombo Process, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Colombo Process is primarily focused on addressing the issue of human trafficking, with India playing a minor role in the initiative.
2.  India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process signals increased engagement in regional counter-trafficking efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Colombo Process is a regional cooperation mechanism focusing on combating transnational crime, including human trafficking, but also encompassing broader security issues.  India's role in the Colombo Process is significant. Statement 2 is correct. India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process indeed reflects its growing commitment to and engagement in regional counter-trafficking and broader security initiatives.  This leadership role underscores India's proactive participation in addressing transnational crime within the region. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybersecurity threats.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, utilizing a methodology that includes both on-site and off-site assessments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybersecurity is a growing concern related to financial crime, it's not a primary focus of the standard MER.  The scope of the MER is defined by the FATF's recommendations, which currently do not include a dedicated section on cybersecurity, although related aspects might be indirectly assessed within other sections.

Statement 2 is correct. India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The peer review process is a core component of the FATF's work, ensuring transparency and accountability.  The process involves both on-site visits (to gather information and assess implementation) and off-site analysis (review of documents and data provided by the evaluated country). This comprehensive approach allows for a thorough evaluation of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report highlights that cocaine is the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy, with the highest prevalence found in the Golden Triangle region.
2. The report identifies the Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the Death Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) as regions with significant drug trafficking and abuse challenges, while the Death Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) shows a decreasing trend.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report actually indicates that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, not cocaine. The order of prevalence mentioned in the statement is also not accurate. The highest prevalence of drug abuse is not necessarily concentrated in the Golden Triangle; the report highlights several regions with significant challenges.

Statement 2 is partially correct in identifying the Triple Frontier Area and Death Crescent as regions of concern. However, the statement incorrectly suggests a decreasing trend in the Death Triangle.  The report's findings on the trends in each region may vary and require a detailed analysis of specific data within the report, rather than a generalized statement.  The renaming of regions (Golden Triangle to Death Triangle, etc.) is a stylistic choice for emphasis and does not reflect a change in the UNODC's official terminology.


**3. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term signifies India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts, but he is not the only Indian representative on the board.
2. The INCB's primary function is to monitor the implementation of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, and does not have enforcement powers but relies on national authorities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While there might be other Indian representatives on the INCB at different times, Mr. Pavadia's re-election certainly underscores India's sustained engagement with global drug control initiatives.  The statement's phrasing is designed to be slightly misleading by implying an exclusive representation that might not be strictly true.

Statement 2 is also correct. The INCB's core mandate is indeed to monitor the implementation of the key international drug control treaties. It lacks direct enforcement powers; its influence relies on its monitoring and reporting functions, which can pressure national governments to improve their drug control measures. The INCB's role is primarily advisory and supervisory, not directly punitive.


**4. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused solely on combating transnational organized crime (TOC) and did not address other crime prevention initiatives.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, launched during the 33rd session, aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice, but its implementation is solely dependent on the UNODC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating TOC was a significant focus of the 33rd session, it's inaccurate to say that *only* TOC was addressed. The CCPCJ's mandate is broader, encompassing various aspects of crime prevention and criminal justice.  The statement is designed to mislead by oversimplifying the session's agenda.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the UNODC likely plays a significant role in supporting the GenJust initiative, the initiative's implementation would involve multiple stakeholders, including national governments, civil society organizations, and other UN entities.  The statement falsely creates a sole reliance on the UNODC.


**5. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. India's election to the GlobE steering committee demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts, and this is its first time participating in the GlobE network.
2. The GlobE network primarily focuses on facilitating information sharing and cooperation among anti-corruption law enforcement agencies globally, but does not engage in policy advocacy or capacity building.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India's election shows commitment, the statement falsely implies that this is India's first involvement with GlobE.  The exact timeline of India's participation would need to be verified independently. The statement is constructed to create a false impression of novelty.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  GlobE likely engages in various activities beyond simple information sharing, including capacity building initiatives and potentially influencing anti-corruption policies through its collective influence. The statement is misleadingly narrow in its description of GlobE's activities.


**6. With reference to the India-Bangladesh relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia, with both countries maintaining a balanced trade relationship.
2.  Key initiatives in India-Bangladesh relations include the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant, and the operationalization of the Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT), but not any joint military exercises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, the statement incorrectly asserts that India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia and that the trade relationship is balanced.  The text only states India is the *second* largest trading partner for Bangladesh in Asia, suggesting an imbalance.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The statement accurately mentions the Friendship Pipeline and Maitree Power Plant. However, it falsely claims that there are *no* joint military exercises between India and Bangladesh.  The text clearly mentions exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN, demonstrating the existence of defense cooperation.


**7. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  The recently signed pact among Nepal, India, and Bangladesh aims to facilitate cross-border electricity trade, focusing primarily on hydropower projects, neglecting any thermal power generation.
2.  Key initiatives in cross-border energy cooperation include projects like Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects (UKHP) between India and Nepal, and Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects between India and Bhutan, but not any pipelines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the pact focuses on hydropower, it is inaccurate to state that it *primarily* focuses on hydropower and *neglects* thermal power. The scope of the agreement might encompass various forms of electricity generation. The statement is crafted to present a limited and potentially false view of the agreement's scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect because it omits the existence of energy pipelines. The text explicitly mentions the TAPI Pipeline, India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, and Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline as examples of cross-border energy infrastructure projects.  The statement is misleading by excluding a crucial aspect of South Asian energy cooperation.


**8. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its sixth-largest globally in 2023-24, with India maintaining a trade surplus with Singapore due to the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).
2.  Key bilateral exercises between India and Singapore include Exercise Agni Warrior (Army), Exercise SIMBEX (Navy), and Joint Military Training (Air Force), and the "Project Nexus" initiative focuses on cross-border payments using only UPI.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is indeed India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its sixth-largest globally, the statement falsely claims that India has a trade *surplus* with Singapore. The text clearly indicates that India is a net *importer* under the CECA.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The statement accurately mentions the bilateral exercises. However, it incorrectly states that "Project Nexus" uses *only* UPI. The project aims to interconnect various Fast Payment Systems (FPSs), including UPI, but not exclusively UPI.  The statement is misleading by oversimplifying the scope of Project Nexus.


**9. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's election as Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council demonstrates its commitment to strengthening regional supply chains, but India is not a member of all three bodies established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement.
2.  The three bodies established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement are the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board, with the primary focus on enhancing labor rights and workforce development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's role as Vice-Chair highlights its participation in supply chain initiatives. However, the statement correctly points out that being Vice-Chair of one body doesn't automatically mean membership in *all* three bodies established under the IPEF agreement.  The statement is designed to be slightly ambiguous, requiring careful consideration of the roles and functions of different IPEF bodies.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the three bodies mentioned are accurate, stating that the *primary* focus is on labor rights and workforce development is an oversimplification. The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement addresses a broader range of issues related to supply chain resilience, including crisis response and overall strengthening of the supply chains.


**10. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus's accession as the tenth member of the SCO signifies expansion of the organization's geographic reach, and it is the first time a European country joined the organization.
2.  Key outcomes of the 24th SCO summit included the adoption of a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism, and an Anti-Drug Strategy, but not any initiative on climate change.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Belarus's accession does expand the SCO's reach, the statement's claim that it is the first European country to join is potentially false, and needs verification. The statement is framed to test the examinee's knowledge of SCO's membership history.

Statement 2 is correct.  The statement accurately reflects the adoption of counter-terrorism and anti-drug strategies at the summit. The absence of a specific mention of climate change initiatives in the provided text doesn't necessarily mean there were none; the information given is limited to the explicit outcomes mentioned.


**11. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, focusing solely on renewable energy projects in developing nations.
2.  Other key G7 initiatives include the Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI), the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition, and the Apulia Food Systems initiative, with the focus on enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture but not on poverty alleviation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the PGII's funding target is accurate, the statement falsely limits the focus to *only* renewable energy projects. The initiative likely encompasses a broader range of sustainable infrastructure projects. The statement is designed to create a misleadingly narrow view of the PGII's scope.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the initiatives mentioned are accurate, the statement falsely excludes any focus on poverty alleviation.  Sustainable agriculture and food security initiatives often have indirect or direct links to poverty reduction. The statement attempts to mislead by omitting a likely, albeit implicit, link between the initiatives and poverty alleviation.


**12. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list highlights its support for Cuba, but NAM does not have any influence on US foreign policy decisions.
2.  The US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" comprises countries that allegedly sponsor international terrorism, and being on this list results in automatic expulsion from the UN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's stance on Cuba's inclusion on the US terrorism list clearly shows its solidarity with Cuba. However, the statement correctly acknowledges that NAM's influence on US foreign policy decisions is limited.  The statement accurately reflects the political dynamics involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the US list comprises countries accused of sponsoring terrorism, being on the list does *not* automatically lead to expulsion from the UN.  The statement creates a false connection between the US list and UN membership.


**13. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing nearly 60% of its total population, and is also the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth.
2.  Key events hosted by India include the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1983 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010, and the Commonwealth Sub Window is funded entirely by India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's significant population within the Commonwealth is accurate. However, the statement incorrectly states that India is the *largest* financial contributor. The text only specifies that India is the *fourth* largest contributor.

Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning the events hosted by India. However, the statement falsely claims that the Commonwealth Sub Window is *entirely* funded by India.  The text states that it was established under the India-UN Development Fund, implying shared funding.


**14. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA, signed in 2009, aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India, and has resulted in a trade surplus for India with ASEAN.
2.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA reviewed the agreement's progress, focusing primarily on resolving disputes related to agricultural products and intellectual property rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the aim of AITIGA is accurate, the statement falsely claims that it has resulted in a trade *surplus* for India. The text explicitly states that India has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the 5th Joint Committee Meeting did review progress, the statement falsely limits the focus to *only* agricultural products and intellectual property rights.  The review likely encompassed a broader range of trade issues.


**15. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 aims to enhance regional financial stability, and this is the first currency swap arrangement involving SAARC member states.
2.  SAARC's decision-making process is based on unanimity, excluding bilateral and contentious issues from its deliberations, and SAARC has been fully functional since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the aim of the currency swap framework is accurate, the statement falsely claims that this is the *first* such arrangement. The existence of other SAARC initiatives and agreements suggests that this is not the first financial cooperation mechanism.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The statement correctly describes SAARC's decision-making process based on unanimity. However, it falsely claims that SAARC has been fully functional since its inception. The text clearly states that SAARC has been largely dysfunctional since 2016.


**16. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter, which came into force in May 2024, grants BIMSTEC legal personality, and this is the first time BIMSTEC has achieved such status.
2.  BIMSTEC's seven focus areas include trade, environment and climate change, security, agriculture and food security, people-to-people contact, science, technology, and innovation, and connectivity, with a primary focus on disaster management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter does grant it legal personality, a significant step in its institutional development. The statement correctly reflects this achievement.

Statement 2 is partially correct in listing the seven focus areas. However, the statement falsely claims that disaster management is the *primary* focus. While disaster management is important, it is not the sole or primary focus of BIMSTEC's activities.  The statement attempts to mislead by overemphasizing one aspect of BIMSTEC's work.


**17. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1.  The passage of the "Strengthening the Quad Act" by the US House of Representatives demonstrates strong US support for the Quad, and this act mandates the creation of a new joint military command for the Quad.
2.  Key announcements in the Wilmington Declaration include the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership, the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership", and the "Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)", with all initiatives focusing solely on technological advancements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the act shows support, the statement falsely claims that it mandates a *new joint military command*. The details of the act would need to be examined independently to verify this claim. The statement is misleading by exaggerating the act's implications.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While the initiatives are accurately mentioned, the statement falsely claims that *all* initiatives focus solely on technological advancements. The initiatives likely have broader implications beyond technology, encompassing health, infrastructure, and capacity building.  The statement creates a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the initiatives' scope.



**1. With reference to the ASEAN-India relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's trade deficit with ASEAN countries has consistently widened since the signing of the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) in 2009.
2.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) primarily focuses on economic cooperation and trade liberalization among its member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  While AITIGA aimed to reduce trade barriers, India has consistently experienced a trade deficit with ASEAN, indicating that the agreement hasn't fully addressed the imbalance. This deficit reflects various factors including differences in production capabilities, competitiveness, and global market dynamics.  The persistent trade deficit highlights the complexities of regional trade agreements and the need for continuous adjustments to achieve balanced economic partnerships.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a prominent forum for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region. While economic factors are considered, its primary mandate is not focused on economic cooperation or trade liberalization; that role is more directly addressed by other ASEAN institutions like the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC). The ARF's focus on political and security matters reflects the importance of regional stability for economic prosperity.  Confusing ARF's role with the AEC's demonstrates a lack of understanding of the distinct roles of regional organizations.


**2. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process conducted by the FATF assesses a country's effectiveness in combating only money laundering and terrorist financing, excluding proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and has not been updated since.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER process comprehensively assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These three areas are intrinsically linked, and effective countermeasures require a holistic approach.  The inclusion of proliferation in the assessment demonstrates the FATF's understanding of the interconnectedness of these threats to global security and financial stability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010,  it has undergone subsequent reviews and updates.  The FATF's evaluation process is not a one-time event; countries are regularly reassessed to monitor their progress and ensure ongoing compliance with international standards. The dynamic nature of these threats requires continuous monitoring and adjustments to countermeasures.  Assuming the 2010 report remains the only assessment shows a misunderstanding of the FATF's ongoing monitoring role.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's decision-making process is based on consensus among all member states, similar to SAARC.
2.  Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 marked the organization's expansion to eleven member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCO emphasizes consensus in its decision-making, it doesn't strictly adhere to the unanimity rule employed by SAARC.  The SCO's decision-making processes allow for more flexibility and compromises compared to the stricter consensus requirements of SAARC. This difference reflects variations in organizational structures and the complexities of managing larger and more diverse memberships.

Statement 2 is correct. Belarus's admission in 2024 indeed increased the SCO's membership to ten states.  This expansion reflects the SCO's growing influence and its strategic importance in the Eurasian region.  The addition of new members often brings new dynamics and challenges to the organization's operations and decision-making processes.  Mistaking the number of members highlights a lack of up-to-date knowledge on the SCO's current composition.


**4.  With reference to India's relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's remittances from GCC countries consistently account for over 50% of India's total remittances.
2.  India maintains strategic partnerships with all six GCC member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While remittances from GCC countries are a significant source of foreign exchange for India, they do not consistently account for over 50% of the total.  The actual percentage fluctuates based on various economic factors, including global economic conditions and migration patterns.  Overestimating the percentage reflects a lack of precise knowledge about the composition of India's remittances.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India has strong and growing ties with several GCC countries, it does not maintain a formal "strategic partnership" with *all* six member states.  The level of strategic engagement varies depending on bilateral relations and specific areas of cooperation.  Assuming all six countries have the same level of partnership shows a misunderstanding of the nuances of India's foreign policy.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India holds the chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2.  The IPEF comprises 14 partner countries including India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India was elected as the Vice-Chair, not the Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council. This reflects India's active participation and commitment to strengthening supply chain resilience within the Indo-Pacific region. The vice-chair role demonstrates India’s significant influence and engagement within the IPEF framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF currently includes 13 partner countries in addition to the United States.  The number of participating countries might change over time as the framework evolves.  Incorrectly stating the number of member countries demonstrates a lack of precise knowledge of the IPEF's composition.


**6. With reference to the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies opioids as the most abused drug globally.
2.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on the illegal wildlife trade in the Golden Triangle region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by other substances like opioids.  Misidentifying the most abused drug shows a lack of familiarity with the UNODC's key findings.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a broader scope than just the Golden Triangle.  While the report examines illegal wildlife trade in various regions, including the Golden Triangle, it also addresses global trends and challenges related to wildlife crime.  Restricting the report's focus to a single region shows a limited understanding of the report's comprehensive nature.


**7. With reference to the  Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 exclusively for projects in African nations.
2.  India holds permanent membership in the G7.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7's PGII initiative, while having a strong focus on Africa, is not limited to that continent.  The initiative aims to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects in developing countries worldwide, reflecting a global approach to infrastructure development.  Restricting the PGII's scope to Africa alone shows a misunderstanding of its broader goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India does not hold permanent membership in the G7.  India is sometimes invited as a guest or partner country to participate in G7 summits, but it is not a formal member.  Confusing guest participation with permanent membership reveals a lack of understanding of the G7's membership structure.


**8. With reference to the  Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions primarily focus on the protection of civilians during armed conflict, excluding the treatment of prisoners of war.
2. The 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions was observed in 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are a set of four treaties that establish international legal standards for humanitarian treatment during wartime.  They cover various aspects, including the protection of wounded and sick combatants, treatment of prisoners of war, protection of civilians, and the prohibition of certain weapons.  Omitting prisoners of war from the scope shows a misunderstanding of the Conventions' breadth.

Statement 2 is correct. The 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions was indeed observed in 2024.  This milestone underscores the enduring importance of these treaties in upholding international humanitarian law and protecting human dignity during armed conflict.  Knowing the anniversary year demonstrates awareness of significant events in international law.


**9. With reference to  India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore has resulted in a significant trade surplus for India.
2.  Project Nexus is a bilateral initiative focused solely on enhancing cross-border payments between India and Singapore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Under the CECA, India has a net *importer* status in its trade relations with Singapore.  The agreement hasn't eliminated the trade imbalance; India continues to import more than it exports.  Misinterpreting the trade balance shows a misunderstanding of the CECA's impact.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Project Nexus is primarily aimed at facilitating cross-border payments between India and Singapore, it is not exclusively limited to these two countries.  The initiative aims to connect various domestic fast payment systems across multiple countries in the region, expanding beyond a strictly bilateral framework.  Confining Project Nexus to just two nations shows a limited understanding of its regional scope.


**10. With reference to the  India-United Kingdom (UK) relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) between India and the UK focuses exclusively on enhancing cybersecurity cooperation.
2. The UK is currently India's top trading partner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TSI between India and the UK has a broader scope than just cybersecurity.  It encompasses cooperation in critical and emerging technologies, including areas like telecommunications, critical minerals, semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and quantum technology.  Restricting the TSI to cybersecurity alone demonstrates a limited understanding of its comprehensive objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UK is not currently India's top trading partner. While bilateral trade is significant, other countries hold a larger share in India's overall trade volume.  Incorrectly identifying the UK as the top trading partner shows a lack of awareness of current trade data.


**1. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is the second largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia. This highlights the significant economic interdependence between the two nations.  The robust trade relationship underscores the importance of maintaining strong bilateral ties for both countries' economic growth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports High Speed Diesel (HSD) and not crude oil. This pipeline is a crucial element of energy cooperation between the two countries, enhancing Bangladesh's energy security and reducing its reliance on other sources.  The project demonstrates India's commitment to assisting its neighbor in addressing its energy needs. The fact that it's HSD and not crude oil is a key differentiating factor that makes the statement incorrect.  Crude oil would typically require different infrastructure and handling procedures.


**2.  With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam is a joint India-Nepal project.
2. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily focused on supplying electricity to Bhutan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam is a bilateral project between India and Bangladesh, aimed at enhancing energy cooperation and trade between the two countries.  The project reflects the growing interconnectedness of the South Asian power grid and the efforts to improve regional energy security.  Nepal is not involved in this specific corridor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily focused on supplying electricity to India, not Bhutan. These projects represent significant investments in hydropower generation in Nepal, and the resulting electricity is exported to India, contributing to India's energy mix and strengthening economic ties between the two nations.  Bhutan has its own separate hydropower projects in collaboration with India, such as Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu.


**3. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is fully demarcated and mutually agreed upon.
2.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash between India and China since 1962.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC between India and China is not fully demarcated and mutually agreed upon.  This lack of clear demarcation is a major source of tension and dispute between the two countries.  The differing interpretations of the LAC by both sides have led to numerous border incidents and standoffs over the years.  The absence of a formally agreed-upon boundary line is a significant challenge in resolving border disputes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Galwan incident of 2020 was indeed the deadliest border clash between India and China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War. This violent confrontation significantly escalated tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors and highlighted the fragility of peace along the disputed border.  The incident underscores the need for effective diplomatic solutions to prevent further escalation and maintain regional stability.


**4. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India has a significant trade deficit with the United States.
2.  The Malabar exercises involve only India and the United States.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India actually has a trade surplus with the United States, not a deficit.  This indicates that India exports more goods and services to the US than it imports. This trade surplus reflects the strength of India's export sector and its growing economic ties with the US.  The trade relationship is a complex one, with both countries benefiting from the exchange of goods and services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Malabar exercises are multilateral naval exercises involving India, the United States, Japan, and Australia.  These exercises demonstrate the growing strategic convergence and military cooperation between these Indo-Pacific nations, aimed at enhancing maritime security and promoting regional stability.  The inclusion of multiple nations makes it a significant platform for joint military training and interoperability.


**5. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1956.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER does indeed assess a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  This assessment is a crucial part of the FATF's efforts to promote global financial integrity and prevent illicit activities. The MER process involves a peer review by FATF members, ensuring a comprehensive and objective evaluation of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956.  The FIU-IND plays a vital role in India's AML/CFT framework, collecting and analyzing financial intelligence to combat financial crime. The difference in establishment years between the FIU-IND and the ED is a crucial detail that makes this statement factually incorrect.


**6. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively monitors illicit trafficking of nuclear weapons.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to enhance global food security.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB monitors illicit trafficking of nuclear and other radioactive materials, not exclusively nuclear weapons. While nuclear weapons are a significant concern, the ITDB's scope encompasses a broader range of radioactive materials that could be misused for malicious purposes.  The database plays a vital role in preventing nuclear terrorism and safeguarding nuclear materials worldwide.  The focus on a wider range of materials is crucial to the ITDB's effectiveness.

Statement 2 is correct. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program does indeed utilize nuclear techniques to improve global food security.  This program uses nuclear technologies and isotopic techniques to enhance crop production, improve livestock breeding, and enhance food safety. The program plays an important role in addressing global food challenges and ensuring food security for a growing world population. The use of nuclear techniques in agriculture is a specific area of focus that makes this statement accurate.


**7. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was signed in 1949 and last renewed in 2007.
2.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, and Bhutan is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was indeed signed in 1949 and last renewed in 2007. This treaty forms the bedrock of the close bilateral relationship between the two countries.  The renewal in 2007 underscored the continuing commitment to maintaining strong and mutually beneficial ties. The treaty's longevity and periodic renewal demonstrate the stability and importance of the India-Bhutan partnership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is Bhutan's largest trading partner,  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, not Bhutan. This highlights the different economic relationships that India has with its neighboring countries.  The correct identification of India's largest South Asian trading partner is a crucial detail that differentiates this statement from the correct one.


**8. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its largest trading partner globally.
2. Project Nexus aims to connect India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with the Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) of several Southeast Asian nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN, it is not India's largest trading partner globally.  The statement incorrectly equates Singapore's position within ASEAN with its global position in trade with India.  Understanding the difference in regional and global trade rankings is essential.

Statement 2 is correct. Project Nexus does aim to connect India's UPI with the FPSs of several Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. This initiative promotes seamless cross-border payments and enhances financial integration within the region.  The focus on connecting UPI with multiple Southeast Asian FPSs is a key feature that makes the statement correct.


**9. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement was signed in 2020.
2.  AUSINDEX is a joint military exercise between India and Australia focusing on air force operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (ECTA) was signed in 2022, not 2020.  The year of signing is a crucial detail that makes the statement factually incorrect.  The ECTA is a significant step towards strengthening economic ties between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AUSINDEX is a joint maritime exercise between India and Australia, not an air force exercise.  The type of military exercise (maritime vs. air force) is a crucial differentiating factor.  AUSINDEX focuses on enhancing naval cooperation and interoperability between the two countries' navies.  Other exercises such as Pitch Black involve the air force.


**1. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. GLOBE Network's primary objective is to facilitate international cooperation in combating transnational organized crime, including money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.  Membership in GLOBE Network is restricted to law enforcement agencies from countries that have ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The GLOBE Network aims to enhance international cooperation among anti-corruption law enforcement authorities.  While combating transnational organized crime is a significant aspect, its focus is broader than just money laundering and terrorist financing; it encompasses a wider range of corruption-related offenses.  The network facilitates information sharing, joint investigations, and capacity building to strengthen global anti-corruption efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While participation in GLOBE Network is likely skewed towards countries with strong anti-corruption frameworks, membership isn't strictly limited to those who have ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption. The network seeks to include a diverse range of law enforcement agencies from various countries to foster a comprehensive global approach to tackling corruption.  Ratification of the UN Convention is beneficial for participating agencies but not a mandatory prerequisite.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) exclusively assess a country's compliance with international standards related to combating money laundering.
2.  India's first MER was adopted in 2010, and subsequent evaluations have consistently rated India as fully compliant with all FATF recommendations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating money laundering is a core component, FATF's MERs have a broader scope. They also assess a country's measures to combat terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The evaluations assess the effectiveness of legal frameworks, institutions, and practical measures taken by a country to prevent and suppress these illicit activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010,  the statement that subsequent evaluations have consistently rated India as fully compliant is inaccurate.  FATF evaluations are ongoing, and a country's rating can fluctuate depending on its progress in implementing recommendations.  The process involves a peer review and involves ongoing monitoring and potential adjustments in a country's compliance.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

1. UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention, entered into force in 2003 and has been ratified by all member states of the United Nations.
2.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) serves as the secretariat for UNTOC and is responsible for coordinating its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNTOC, or Palermo Convention, is a significant international treaty, it entered into force in 2003, not 2000.  More importantly, it hasn't been ratified by *all* UN member states.  Ratification requires individual action by each nation, and there are countries that have not yet become parties to the Convention.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC plays a crucial role in UNTOC's implementation.  It acts as the secretariat, providing technical assistance, coordinating efforts among member states, and monitoring the progress of the Convention's implementation globally.  This role ensures effective coordination and facilitates international cooperation in combating transnational organized crime.


**4. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly, responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB signifies India's continued commitment to international cooperation in drug control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INCB is not a subsidiary body of the UN General Assembly. It's an independent and quasi-judicial body established under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs and has its own distinct mandate and authority.  It monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties and provides expert advice to the UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs.

Statement 2 is correct.  The re-election of Jagjit Pavadia to the INCB reflects India's sustained dedication to international collaboration in drug control.  India's participation in the INCB demonstrates its commitment to upholding international norms and contributing to global efforts to combat the illicit drug trade.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the "Golden Crescent" region:**

1. The Golden Crescent, now often referred to as the "Death Crescent," is primarily located in South America and encompasses countries known for significant cocaine production.
2.  The major illicit drugs produced in the Golden Crescent region include opium, heroin, and cannabis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Golden Crescent, now frequently called the "Death Crescent," is situated in Southwest Asia, encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. These countries are historically significant for opium and heroin production, not cocaine, which is predominantly associated with the "Golden Triangle" and South America.

Statement 2 is correct. The Golden Crescent is notorious for its production of opium, which is processed into heroin, and also cannabis.  The region's geographic location, political instability, and socio-economic factors have contributed to its role as a major source of these illicit drugs in the global market.


**6. With reference to Cannabis Legalisation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The legalisation of cannabis for recreational use is currently widespread across the globe, with most developed nations having fully legalised it.
2.  Canada and Uruguay are among the few countries that have fully legalised cannabis for both recreational and medicinal purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The legalisation of cannabis for recreational use is not widespread globally. While there is a growing movement towards decriminalisation and legalisation in various countries and regions, it remains a highly contentious issue with significant legal and societal implications. Many countries still maintain strict prohibitions against cannabis.

Statement 2 is correct. Canada and Uruguay are notable examples of countries that have legalised cannabis for both recreational and medicinal use.  This represents a significant shift in drug policy, though the long-term effects and societal impacts are still being studied and debated.  The US has also seen legalization in various states but not at a federal level.


**7. With reference to the Commonwealth Sub Window, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth Sub Window was established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund in 2018 with an initial funding of $100 million over a 5-year period.
2. The Commonwealth Sub Window primarily focuses on supporting projects related to climate change mitigation and adaptation in Commonwealth countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window was indeed established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund in 2018, but the initial funding was $50 million, not $100 million, over a 5-year period.  The fund aims to support development initiatives within the Commonwealth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Commonwealth Sub Window likely supports projects relevant to sustainable development goals, the statement that it *primarily* focuses on climate change mitigation and adaptation is an oversimplification. The fund's scope is broader, encompassing various areas of development cooperation. The specific projects funded would vary depending on the needs and priorities of the recipient Commonwealth countries.


**8.  With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue is held annually, alternating between the GCC countries and India.
2. The Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 adopted at the recent India-GCC meeting primarily focuses on enhancing trade and investment cooperation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text does not specify the frequency of the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue.  While it mentions a recent meeting, it does not state that it's an annual event or that the meetings alternate between GCC countries and India.  The frequency would depend on the mutual agreement of the participating parties.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although enhancing trade and investment is likely a component of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028,  the statement that it *primarily* focuses on this aspect is an oversimplification.  The plan likely encompasses a broader range of strategic cooperation, including political dialogue, security, and other areas of mutual interest between India and the GCC countries.  The exact details would be outlined in the plan itself.



**1. With reference to the geographical features of Belize, consider the following statements:**

1. Belize shares its land boundaries with Mexico to the north and Guatemala to the south and east.
2. Belize's maritime boundaries include the Caribbean Sea to the east and the Gulf of Mexico to the west.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Belize shares its land boundary with Mexico to the north and Guatemala to the west and south.  The statement incorrectly positions Guatemala to the south and east.  Belize's eastern border is the Caribbean Sea.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belize's maritime boundaries include the Caribbean Sea to the east, but it borders the Gulf of Honduras (a part of the Caribbean Sea) and not the Gulf of Mexico. The Gulf of Mexico is significantly to the north of Belize.  The statement incorrectly assigns the Gulf of Mexico as a maritime boundary.  The precise description of maritime boundaries is crucial in geopolitical contexts and often involves complex legal and geographical considerations.  Therefore, option (a) is the most appropriate answer, acknowledging the partial correctness of statement 1 while highlighting the incorrectness of statement 2.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bolivia is indeed landlocked, its bordering countries are not accurately represented.  Brazil borders Bolivia to the north and east, but Peru is to the northwest, and Chile borders to the southwest, not the south.  The description of the bordering countries is inaccurate, making the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. Paraguay does share a border with Bolivia to the southeast, and Argentina borders Bolivia to the south.  The statement correctly identifies these countries and their relative locations with respect to Bolivia.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate choice.  The precise identification of a nation's borders is crucial for understanding its geopolitical context and relationships with neighboring states.


**3. With reference to Panama's geographical features and bordering countries, consider the following statements:**

1. Panama is located on the Isthmus of Panama, a narrow strip of land connecting North and South America, and borders Costa Rica to the east and Colombia to the west.
2. Panama's maritime boundaries consist of the Pacific Ocean to the north and the Caribbean Sea to the south.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because it reverses the locations of Costa Rica and Colombia. Panama borders Costa Rica to the west and Colombia to the east. The incorrect placement of these countries demonstrates a lack of precise geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is also incorrect because it reverses the locations of the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The Pacific Ocean borders Panama to the south, and the Caribbean Sea borders it to the north.  The reversed description of the maritime boundaries indicates a misunderstanding of Panama's geographical orientation.  Therefore, both statements are inaccurate, leading to (d) as the correct answer.  Accurate knowledge of geographical features and bordering countries is essential for geopolitical analysis and international relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Trinidad and Tobago is an island nation in the southeastern Caribbean Sea, and its proximity to Venezuela is accurate.  While the statement describes the location as "northeastern," a more precise description would be southeastern. However, this minor imprecision does not invalidate the core geographical accuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Guyana is located to the southwest of Trinidad and Tobago, not to its west. This demonstrates a misunderstanding of the relative geographical positions of these countries.  Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct, making (a) the appropriate answer.  The precise location and proximity of countries are critical elements in understanding regional dynamics and international relations.


**5. With reference to New Zealand's geographical features and location, consider the following statements:**

1. New Zealand is an island country located in the South Atlantic Ocean, situated between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle.
2.  New Zealand comprises two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, separated by the Cook Strait.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because it places New Zealand in the South Atlantic Ocean.  New Zealand is located in the South Pacific Ocean, not the South Atlantic. The incorrect ocean designation demonstrates a significant geographical error.

Statement 2 is correct. New Zealand's composition of two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, separated by the Cook Strait, is accurate. This description accurately reflects New Zealand's geographical makeup. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.  Accurate geographical knowledge is fundamental to understanding a country's context and its relationship with its environment.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCO's anti-drug strategy is significant, it’s highly unlikely that it would be limited to only heroin and opium.  A comprehensive anti-drug strategy would encompass a broader range of illicit substances.  This tests the candidate's ability to infer the probable scope of such an initiative.

Statement 2 is correct. The information about Belarus joining the SCO and the resulting membership number is accurate.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.


**9. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list highlights its commitment to supporting countries facing unfair economic sanctions imposed by major powers.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's advocacy for Cuba reflects its broader goal of supporting nations subjected to unilateral sanctions.  This demonstrates understanding of NAM's core principles and its role in international relations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  NAM's members don't necessarily maintain strict neutrality in all conflicts.  The movement's focus is on independent foreign policy and non-alignment with major power blocs, not absolute neutrality in every global event.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the nuances of NAM's approach to international politics.


**10. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is the largest among all member states.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the MER does assess India's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the first adoption of India's MER was in 2010, not 2005. The statement also incorrectly emphasizes the financial intelligence unit disproportionately.  The assessment is more holistic.

Statement 2 is correct. The FATF's MER process is indeed a peer review conducted by member countries.  It comprehensively examines a nation's legal frameworks, institutions (including but not limited to the FIU), and initiatives to combat financial crimes, offering recommendations for enhancement. The process is designed to be collaborative and objective.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate year mentioned in statement 1. Option (b) accurately reflects the peer-review nature of the MER process and its comprehensive scope in evaluating India's anti-financial crime measures.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  SIPRI was actually established in 1966, not 1976. The statement contains an error in the year of establishment.

Both statements contain factual errors; therefore, the correct answer is (d).  Neither statement accurately reflects SIPRI's findings or its founding date.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2024 and assesses the effectiveness of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, among other measures.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER is a crucial tool for evaluating a country's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime. It comprehensively assesses a nation's efforts in preventing these illicit activities and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The peer-review process involves other FATF members, ensuring a robust and objective assessment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PMLA and UAPA are indeed key legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, the statement incorrectly states that India's MER was first adopted in 2024.  India's first MER was adopted much earlier, in 2010.  The statement also presents an oversimplified view of the MER's scope, implying it focuses solely on those two Acts, neglecting other crucial aspects of India's AML/CFT framework, such as the role of the FIU-IND and ED, and international cooperation initiatives.  The 2024 assessment would be a subsequent review, not the first.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's reports on drug abuse, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, with the Golden Triangle (now called the Death Triangle) and the Golden Crescent (now called the Death Crescent) as regions with significant drug production and trafficking.
2. The UNODC's report indicates that cannabis legalization in Canada, Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions has not significantly impacted global cannabis abuse rates, as it remains the most widely abused drug.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects key findings from the UNODC's World Drug Day report.  The report indeed highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug, followed by opioids. It also correctly identifies the geographical regions previously known as the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent (now renamed Death Triangle and Death Crescent, respectively) as areas of significant concern regarding drug production and trafficking.  The renaming reflects the severity of the drug problem in these regions.

Statement 2 is misleading. While the report does identify cannabis as the most abused drug globally, it does not explicitly state or imply that the legalization efforts in Canada, Uruguay, and parts of the US have *not* impacted global abuse rates.  The impact of legalization on global cannabis abuse is a complex issue requiring further research and analysis, and the UNODC report likely doesn't provide a definitive conclusion on this specific aspect.  The statement presents an unsupported assertion as a fact.

This diversification of trade routes enhances resilience and security for participating nations and contributes to the overall goal of promoting regional economic integration and development.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's 24th summit saw the addition of Belarus as its tenth member, signifying an expansion of the organization's geographical reach and influence.
2.  The SCO's focus on counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism is primarily directed towards addressing internal security threats within its member states, with limited emphasis on regional or global cooperation on these issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate.  The 24th SCO summit did indeed welcome Belarus as its newest member, marking a significant expansion of the organization's membership and geographical scope. This expansion reflects the evolving geopolitical landscape and the SCO's growing influence in Eurasia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO does address internal security threats within its member states, its focus on counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism is not solely limited to internal matters. The organization actively engages in regional and international cooperation to combat these threats, sharing intelligence, conducting joint exercises, and participating in multilateral initiatives to address these trans-national security challenges.  The statement presents an overly narrow interpretation of the SCO's security agenda.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the India-Bangladesh relationship:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia, reflecting the strong economic interdependence between the two nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately highlights the strategic importance of the Chabahar Port. Its location on the Gulf of Oman provides India with an alternative route to Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan and significantly reducing transit times and costs for trade with landlocked countries, particularly Afghanistan. This strategic location makes it a crucial element in India's regional connectivity initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the 2016 tripartite agreement was a significant step, the development and implementation of the Chabahar Port project have faced various challenges, including geopolitical complexities, sanctions, and financial hurdles.  The project's progress has not been without obstacles, and the statement presents an overly optimistic and unrealistic view of the project's implementation.  The statement ignores the complexities of international project development.


**7. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multimodal transport network connecting India, Iran, and Russia, aiming to provide an alternative trade route to the Suez Canal, reducing transit times and costs for trade between India and Europe.
2. The INSTC's primary focus is on maritime transport, utilizing sea routes to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia, with limited emphasis on rail or road transport.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the INSTC's key features and objectives. The corridor indeed spans approximately 7,200 km and connects India, Iran, and Russia, aiming to create an alternative trade route to the Suez Canal.  This multimodal network incorporates various transport modes – sea, rail, and road – to provide a more efficient and cost-effective route for trade between India and Europe.  The diversification of trade routes enhances trade and reduces reliance on a single, potentially vulnerable, shipping lane.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the INSTC utilizes sea routes, it's explicitly designed as a *multimodal* transport network.  This means it strategically integrates rail and road transport networks along with sea routes to optimize efficiency and connectivity throughout the corridor. The statement oversimplifies the INSTC's transport modalities, neglecting the crucial role of rail and road networks.


**8. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates with a permanent secretariat and a fixed annual agenda, ensuring consistent policy coordination and follow-up on agreed actions among its member states.
2.  The G7's initiatives, such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), primarily focus on providing financial and technical assistance to developed nations to bolster their infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 does not have a permanent secretariat or a fixed annual agenda.  Its presidency rotates annually among its member states, and each presidency sets its own priorities and agenda, leading to variations in focus and policy outcomes across different years.  The lack of a permanent structure is a key characteristic of the G7.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The G7's initiatives, including the PGII, are primarily aimed at supporting infrastructure development in *developing* nations, not developed countries. The PGII, for instance, seeks to mobilize substantial investments to enhance infrastructure in developing economies, focusing on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality projects.  The statement misrepresents the target beneficiaries of G7 initiatives.


**9. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, grants the organization legal personality, enhancing its ability to engage in international agreements and collaborations.
2. BIMSTEC’s focus areas include trade, environment and climate change, security, and agriculture, but exclude areas such as science, technology, and innovation, and connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key development in BIMSTEC's evolution. The adoption of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2022 did indeed grant the organization legal personality, significantly strengthening its institutional framework and enabling it to participate more effectively in international collaborations and agreements.  This legal personality is a crucial step for the organization's long-term effectiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  BIMSTEC's focus areas encompass a broader range of issues than stated. While trade, environment, security, and agriculture are indeed key areas, BIMSTEC also prioritizes science, technology, and innovation, as well as connectivity, as important aspects of regional cooperation and development. The statement presents an incomplete and inaccurate list of BIMSTEC's focus areas.


**10. With reference to the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) tracks incidents of nuclear material theft globally, providing critical information for strengthening nuclear security measures.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative utilizes nuclear technology to improve agricultural practices and enhance food production in developed nations, focusing on increasing crop yields and improving food quality.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the IAEA's ITDB.  This database is a crucial tool for monitoring and reporting incidents of nuclear material theft and illicit trafficking worldwide. The information gathered contributes significantly to improving nuclear security measures and preventing the proliferation of nuclear materials.  The database plays a vital role in international nuclear safety efforts.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative does utilize nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural practices and food production, its focus is not limited to developed nations.  The initiative aims to improve food security globally, targeting both developed and developing countries to address food shortages and nutritional deficiencies.  The statement misrepresents the scope and target beneficiaries of the Atoms4Food initiative.


**1. With reference to multinational military exercises involving India, consider the following statements:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint maritime exercise exclusively between India and Brazil.
2. Exercise Pitch Black is a biennial multinational air exercise in which India participates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise involving the Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies.  It is not exclusive to India and Brazil. The inclusion of South Africa makes the statement factually inaccurate.  The exercise focuses on enhancing interoperability and cooperation among the participating nations in maritime domains.

Statement 2 is correct. Exercise Pitch Black is indeed a biennial multinational air exercise, and India does participate. This exercise provides a valuable platform for air forces from various countries to share best practices, improve interoperability, and enhance their collective capabilities in air combat and related operations. The participation of India underscores its growing engagement in multinational defense collaborations.


**2. With reference to India's participation in international military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Cutlass Express is a U.S. Navy-led maritime exercise held in the Mediterranean Sea, with Indian Navy participation.
2. Exercise Orion involves India, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Spain, and the United States of America, and is primarily focused on land warfare.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's Navy does participate in Exercise Cutlass Express, it is not held in the Mediterranean Sea. The exercise's location is specifically mentioned as Seychelles, indicating a different geographical area of operation.  The exercise focuses on maritime security cooperation and typically involves various maritime operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Orion is a multinational exercise with the listed participants, but it is not primarily focused on land warfare. It is a maritime exercise, focusing on naval cooperation and interoperability, reflecting the broader strategic interests of the participating nations in maritime security and stability. The statement’s assertion about land warfare is factually inaccurate.


**3. With reference to  multilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Desert Flag is a multilateral air exercise primarily involving Asian nations, with Indian Air Force participation.
2. Operation Southern Readiness is an annual multinational exercise conducted solely by the Indian Navy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Desert Flag is a multilateral air exercise, it does involve nations beyond just Asia; it includes countries from Europe, the Middle East, and North America.  While the list of participating nations is extensive, it's inaccurate to describe it as primarily involving only Asian nations.  India's participation is a testament to its expanding defense partnerships.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Southern Readiness is a multinational exercise, but it is not conducted solely by the Indian Navy.  It is a collaborative effort involving multiple navies, including the US, Italy, UK, and Seychelles, working together under the Combined Maritime Forces. The statement wrongly attributes sole responsibility to the Indian Navy.


**4. With reference to humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Sadbhav is an Indian Army initiative focused solely on providing HADR within India's borders.
2. Tiger Triumph 2024 is a bilateral tri-service HADR amphibious exercise between India and China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Operation Sadbhav is indeed an Indian Army initiative designed for civic action and HADR, but its operations are primarily focused on specific regions within India, such as Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, and Sikkim.  The statement accurately reflects the domestic focus of this operation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Tiger Triumph 2024 is a bilateral tri-service HADR amphibious exercise, but it is not between India and China. The correct partner nation in this exercise is the United States, signifying the growing collaboration between the two countries in HADR capabilities. The inclusion of China in the statement is a significant factual error.


**5. With reference to India’s role in UN peacekeeping, consider the following statements:**

1. In 2023, India was the second-highest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces.
2. The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in South America.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India was actually the *highest*, not second-highest, contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023. This highlights India's significant commitment to international peace and security.  The statement underestimates India's contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not South America. This reflects the significant peacekeeping challenges and needs present in that region. The statement misidentifies the geographical area with the largest deployment.


**1. With reference to the G4 nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The G4 nations comprise Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, advocating for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2. The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group actively supports the G4 nations' bid for permanent UNSC membership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The G4 nations—Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan—are a group of countries that have been actively campaigning for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.  Their advocacy is based on the argument that their economic and political influence warrants greater representation on the council.  They have engaged in various diplomatic efforts to garner support for their proposal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, also known as the Coffee Club,  *opposes* the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council seats.  The UfC argues that expanding the permanent membership would be detrimental to the council's effectiveness and legitimacy.  They advocate for a different approach to Security Council reform, often suggesting an increase in the number of non-permanent members instead.  The UfC's opposition to the G4's proposal forms a significant obstacle to the G4’s aims.  Therefore, the assertion that the UfC supports the G4 is factually inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC's jurisdiction extends to all member states of the United Nations, regardless of their ratification of the Rome Statute.
2.  Arrest warrants issued by the ICC are binding on all nations, ensuring immediate apprehension of the accused.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC's jurisdiction is not universal and does not automatically extend to all UN member states.  Its jurisdiction is determined by the Rome Statute, the treaty that established the court. Only states that have ratified the Rome Statute are subject to the ICC's jurisdiction.  Many nations, including major powers like the US and China, have not ratified the treaty and are therefore not subject to its authority.  The ICC's authority is limited to those states that have explicitly consented to it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While ICC arrest warrants are serious legal instruments, they are not automatically binding on all nations.  The enforcement of ICC warrants relies on the cooperation of member states.  Many states, even those who are signatories to the Rome Statute, may be reluctant or unable to arrest and extradite individuals indicted by the ICC due to political considerations, domestic laws, or other factors. The effectiveness of the ICC's arrest warrants depends heavily on the willingness of individual states to comply, which is not always guaranteed.


**3. With reference to the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDB's headquarters are located in New Delhi, India, reflecting India's significant contribution to its establishment.
2. The NDB primarily focuses on funding infrastructure projects within BRICS nations, excluding external collaborations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The headquarters of the New Development Bank (NDB) are situated in Shanghai, China, not New Delhi, India. While India is a significant member of the BRICS group and plays a crucial role in the bank's operations, the decision to locate the headquarters in Shanghai reflects various geopolitical and strategic factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The NDB's mandate extends beyond solely funding infrastructure projects within BRICS nations. While a significant portion of its funding is directed towards infrastructure development within the BRICS countries, the bank also actively collaborates with and extends funding to other developing economies.  This broader approach reflects the NDB's aim to support sustainable development and economic growth in emerging markets globally.


**4. With reference to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ARF was established in 1994 with the primary objective of promoting military alliances among its members.
2. India joined the ARF in 2002, significantly strengthening its engagement with Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994, but its primary objective is not the promotion of military alliances.  The ARF is a forum for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region. It operates on a principle of consensus and seeks to foster confidence-building measures and prevent conflict through diplomatic means rather than forming military alliances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India joined the ARF in 1996, not 2002. This marked a significant step in India's engagement with the Southeast Asian region and its commitment to regional security cooperation.  India's participation in the ARF has allowed it to engage with key players in the region and contribute to regional stability.


**5.  With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus joined the SCO in 2023, becoming the ninth member state.
2.  The SCO's primary focus is on economic cooperation, with minimal emphasis on security issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus officially joined the SCO in 2024, becoming its tenth member state.  This expansion reflects the SCO's growing influence and its engagement with a wider range of countries in the Eurasian region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO does focus on economic cooperation, it also has a strong emphasis on security issues. The organization's mandate explicitly includes addressing regional security threats, counterterrorism, and combating extremism.  Many of the SCO's initiatives and joint military exercises reflect this security focus. The organization's security component is a significant part of its overall agenda.


**6. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 operates with a permanent secretariat, ensuring consistent policy implementation.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative focused solely on infrastructure projects within G7 nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 does *not* have a permanent secretariat.  Its operations are coordinated through a rotating presidency system, with each member nation holding the presidency for one year and setting the agenda for that period.  This lack of a permanent structure reflects the G7's informal nature and its emphasis on consensus-based decision-making.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative, but its focus is not limited to infrastructure projects within G7 nations.  The PGII aims to mobilize private sector investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries, supporting sustainable development and economic growth in these regions.  It's a significant global initiative extending far beyond the borders of the G7 members themselves.


**7. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  IMEC was officially announced during the sidelines of the G20 summit held in Bali, Indonesia.
2.  IMEC's primary focus is on air transport, aiming to reduce travel time between India, the Middle East, and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the precise announcement details may vary depending on the source, the IMEC's inception and initial discussions are not directly linked to a specific G20 summit in Bali.  The corridor's conceptualization and development have likely involved multiple discussions and agreements over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IMEC's focus is not solely on air transport.  The corridor envisions a multimodal transportation network encompassing various modes, including rail, ship-to-rail, and road transport routes. This integrated approach aims to improve connectivity and efficiency in transporting goods and people across different regions.


**8. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INSTC primarily aims to connect India with South East Asia, bypassing the Strait of Malacca.
2.  Iran is not a participant in the INSTC initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INSTC's primary objective is to connect India with Russia and Europe, not Southeast Asia.  The corridor utilizes a route that passes through Iran and Central Asia, providing an alternative to the traditional sea routes through the Suez Canal.  The focus is on enhancing connectivity with Eurasian markets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Iran is a key participant in the INSTC initiative.  The corridor's route significantly relies on Iranian infrastructure and connectivity, making Iran a crucial partner in its operation.


**9. With reference to the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The CRA's primary function is to provide long-term financial assistance to member nations facing economic crises.
2.  All BRICS nations contribute equally to the CRA's reserve pool.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BRICS CRA is designed to provide *short-term* liquidity support to member nations facing balance-of-payments challenges, not long-term financial assistance. It serves as a safety net for temporary difficulties, not a solution for protracted economic crises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CRA aims for equitable participation, the contributions of BRICS nations to the reserve pool are not perfectly equal.  The contributions are based on a formula that considers various economic factors, resulting in varying levels of participation from each member.


**10. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB's headquarters are located in Beijing, China.
2.  India holds the largest voting share in the AIIB.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AIIB's headquarters are located in Beijing, China. This reflects China's leading role in the bank's establishment and its significant contribution to its capital.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is a significant shareholder in the AIIB and holds a substantial voting share, China holds the largest voting share in the bank, reflecting its larger contribution to the bank's capital.  The voting shares are not evenly distributed among the member nations.


**1. With reference to the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDB's headquarters are located in Brasilia, Brazil, reflecting its commitment to South American development.
2.  The NDB's primary focus is on providing short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payments crises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The headquarters of the New Development Bank (NDB) are in Shanghai, China, not Brasilia, Brazil.  While the NDB aims to foster development in BRICS and emerging economies, its location in Shanghai reflects the significant economic weight of China within the BRICS grouping and its role in global finance. The choice of location is a strategic decision reflecting the global distribution of power within the financial sector.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The NDB's primary mandate is to fund infrastructure projects in BRICS and other emerging economies, not solely to provide short-term liquidity support. While the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) serves that purpose, it's a separate mechanism within the BRICS framework, not the core function of the NDB.  The NDB aims for long-term sustainable development through infrastructure financing, contributing to economic growth and stability in its member nations.


**2. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. IPEF was launched in 2023 with the primary goal of creating a regional customs union among participating nations.
2.  The IPEF includes provisions for a robust crisis response network to address disruptions in regional supply chains.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPEF was launched in 2022, not 2023. More importantly, IPEF is not designed to create a regional customs union.  A customs union implies a common external tariff and harmonized trade policies among member states. IPEF focuses on broader economic cooperation, including supply chain resilience, clean energy, and digital economy initiatives, without the stringent requirements of a customs union.  The framework allows for greater flexibility in addressing diverse national interests.

Statement 2 is correct.  The IPEF explicitly includes the establishment of a Crisis Response Network as one of its key pillars. This network aims to facilitate coordinated responses to disruptions in regional supply chains, enhancing resilience and stability. This is a crucial element in the framework's strategy to address potential economic shocks and ensure the smooth flow of goods and services.


**3. With reference to the Group of 7 (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates under a permanent secretariat based in Brussels, Belgium, ensuring continuity in its operations.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative focused solely on financing renewable energy projects in developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent secretariat.  Its leadership rotates annually among member states, with the presiding nation setting the agenda for that year. This rotating presidency system reflects a deliberate decision to maintain a flexible and adaptable framework, avoiding the bureaucratic rigidity of a permanent institution.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the PGII is a G7 initiative aiming to mobilize significant investment for infrastructure projects in developing nations, its scope is not limited to renewable energy. The initiative aims to support a broader range of infrastructure development, encompassing sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality projects across various sectors, not just renewable energy. The focus is on sustainable and quality infrastructure development.


**4. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1. India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1994, shortly after its establishment.
2. The ASEAN Future Forum, proposed in 2023, excludes India from its membership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996, not 1994.  The ARF was established in 1994, but India's participation began two years later.  This reflects the gradual development of India's engagement with ASEAN, starting with dialogue partnerships and progressing to deeper levels of cooperation.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. India is a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum, proposed in 2023. The forum aims to bring together ASEAN member states and partner countries to discuss and share new policy recommendations.  India's inclusion highlights its growing role in regional diplomacy and its commitment to cooperation within the Indo-Pacific region.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus became the ninth member state to join the SCO in 2024.
2. The SCO's primary focus is on promoting economic cooperation, excluding any security-related initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus became the tenth member state to join the SCO, not the ninth.  The addition of Belarus signifies the SCO's expanding influence and its engagement with a broader range of Eurasian countries.  The SCO's membership reflects a complex geopolitical landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO promotes economic cooperation, it also has a significant security dimension.  The organization actively addresses issues such as counter-terrorism, separatism, and extremism.  The SCO's approach integrates both economic and security considerations, reflecting the interconnected nature of regional stability and development.  The organization's focus on security is a crucial aspect of its overall mandate.


**6.  With reference to the  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC was officially launched during the 2023 G20 summit in New Delhi.
2. IMEC's primary objective is to enhance India's maritime security by reducing its reliance on traditional shipping routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the IMEC was announced on the sidelines of a G20 summit,  the exact summit and year is not specified in the provided text.  The announcement of major international initiatives often occurs at significant multilateral events, but the precise timing and location can vary.  The focus should be on the core concept of the IMEC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IMEC aims to improve connectivity and facilitate faster movement of goods between Europe and Asia, but its primary objective is not solely focused on enhancing maritime security by reducing reliance on traditional routes.  While improved connectivity might have indirect security benefits, the main goal is to boost economic integration and trade.  The IMEC is primarily an economic initiative with potential secondary security implications.


**7. With reference to the  Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, consider the following statements:**

1. The UfC actively supports the G4 nations' bid for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2.  Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico are among the member states of the UfC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UfC (also known as the Coffee Club) explicitly opposes the G4 nations' request for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.  The UfC advocates for a different approach to Security Council reform, emphasizing a broader representation of countries and avoiding a concentration of power in a few select nations.  The UfC's stance is a direct counterpoint to the G4 proposal.

Statement 2 is correct. Argentina and Mexico are indeed members of the UfC.  Brazil is not listed as a member in the provided text. The UfC comprises a diverse group of nations, reflecting a range of viewpoints on UN reform and global governance.  The inclusion of Argentina and Mexico highlights the UfC's aim for broader representation in international decision-making.


**8. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICC issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin in February 2023.
2.  Member states of the ICC are legally obligated to comply with arrest warrants issued by the court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC issued an arrest warrant against Vladimir Putin in March 2023, not February. While the precise date is a detail, it highlights the importance of accuracy in international legal matters.  The timing of the warrant is relevant to understanding the evolving geopolitical context.

Statement 2 is correct. Member states of the ICC are indeed legally bound to cooperate with the court and comply with its arrest warrants.  This obligation is a cornerstone of the ICC's effectiveness, ensuring that individuals accused of grave international crimes can be brought to justice.  Failure to comply can have significant implications for the state's relationship with the international community.  The principle of cooperation is essential for the court's legitimacy and authority.


**9. With reference to India's initiatives for the Global South, consider the following statements:**

1. India has pledged $15 million for a Social Impact Fund to support Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in the Global South.
2. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum is designed to foster partnerships between Global South countries and developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's pledge for the Social Impact Fund to support DPI in the Global South is $25 million, not $15 million. While the precise amount is a detail, it demonstrates the scale of India's commitment to digital infrastructure development in the Global South.  The difference in figures highlights the importance of precise information in assessing policy commitments.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum primarily aims at promoting education and capacity building *within* the Global South, not partnerships with developed nations.  While there might be indirect links with developed nations, the program's focus is on strengthening the diplomatic capabilities of young professionals from Global South countries.  The distinction highlights the initiative's focus on self-reliance and South-South cooperation.



**10. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2010 with the objective of eliminating all trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2. India currently enjoys a significant trade surplus with ASEAN under the AITIGA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2010.  The year is a factual detail, but the more significant point is that AITIGA aims to *reduce*, not eliminate, trade barriers between ASEAN and India.  Complete elimination of barriers is a complex process, often involving various stages and exceptions.  The focus is on the gradual reduction of trade barriers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India currently has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus, under the AITIGA framework.  This highlights the complexities of regional trade balances and the need for nuanced analysis of economic relationships.  The nature of the trade balance is a crucial aspect of understanding the economic dynamics between India and ASEAN.


**1. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is envisioned as a crucial element in fostering global connectivity, aiming to enhance trade and economic cooperation between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
2.  The IMEC's primary objective is to establish a dedicated physical infrastructure, such as a new high-speed rail network, connecting major cities across the three regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The IMEC's conceptualization highlights its role in strengthening global connectivity by facilitating trade and economic collaborations among India, the Middle East, and Europe.  The focus is on creating a more efficient and integrated economic zone.  This aligns with the statement made by the Minister of External Affairs about the IMEC being a cornerstone of global connectivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While improved infrastructure will undoubtedly be a component of the IMEC's success, the corridor's focus is not limited to a single, dedicated physical infrastructure project like a high-speed rail network. The IMEC is a broader strategic initiative encompassing diverse infrastructural improvements, digital connectivity enhancements, and regulatory harmonizations to streamline trade and investment flows across the three regions.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the IMEC by oversimplifying its multifaceted nature.  The IMEC is likely to involve multiple modes of transportation and communication, not just a single high-speed rail line.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While counter-terrorism is a significant focus of the SCO's 2025-2027 Cooperation Program,  it is not the *sole* area of focus. The organization addresses a broader range of regional cooperation initiatives, including economic development, cultural exchange, and environmental protection. The text mentions other programs like the Anti-Drug Strategy and the SCO Development Strategy, demonstrating a wider scope than solely counter-terrorism.

Statement 2 is correct.  Belarus's entry as the tenth member state is accurately reflected in the provided text. This expansion significantly alters the SCO's geopolitical dynamics,  influencing its regional power balance and strategic outlook.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties, it hasn't *eliminated* all barriers.  Trade liberalization is an ongoing process, and some barriers still exist.  The agreement's objective is progressive reduction, not immediate total elimination.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This indicates that India's imports from ASEAN exceed its exports to the region, despite the efforts of AITIGA to improve trade relations.


**5. With reference to the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDB, headquartered in Shanghai, China, primarily focuses on funding infrastructure projects within BRICS nations and excludes emerging economies outside the BRICS group.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDB's mandate extends beyond solely funding infrastructure within BRICS nations.  It also provides financial support to emerging economies outside the BRICS group, promoting broader global development.  The text explicitly mentions that the NDB funds infrastructure in BRICS *and* emerging economies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While China is a significant shareholder in the NDB, the bank's structure is designed to ensure *equal* representation and voting power for all member states.  The text specifically highlights this principle of equal voting power, negating the assertion of Chinese veto power.


**6. With reference to the  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) and India relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India's remittances from GCC countries constitute approximately 15% of India’s total remittances.
2. The GCC region accounts for roughly 50% of India's oil imports and nearly 50% of its gas imports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that GCC countries contribute 30% of India's total remittances, not 15%.  This is a significant difference, highlighting the importance of the GCC in supporting Indian migrant workers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage indicates that the GCC contributes to 35% of India's oil imports and 70% of its gas imports.  The statement significantly underestimates the GCC's contribution to India's energy security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Geneva Conventions encompass a broader range of protections within international humanitarian law,  covering not only prisoners of war but also civilians, wounded soldiers, and medical personnel during armed conflict.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishing the ICC is a separate international treaty, not a direct amendment to the Geneva Conventions. While both instruments contribute to international law, they are distinct legal frameworks addressing different aspects of international justice and humanitarian protection.  The Geneva Conventions are concerned with the conduct of warfare; the Rome Statute focuses on prosecuting individuals for war crimes and other serious international crimes.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2007 treaty, while renewing the 1949 treaty, did not fundamentally alter Bhutan's dependence on India for its security and foreign policy.  The treaty reaffirmed the close security cooperation between the two countries, but it did not grant Bhutan complete autonomy.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF's MER primarily focuses on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing,  it also considers other related financial crimes, including those potentially linked to cybercrime, though not explicitly stated as a separate category. The scope of the evaluation is comprehensive, encompassing various aspects of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework.  The statement is misleading by suggesting a narrower scope than what actually exists.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010. The process is a peer review conducted by other FATF members, ensuring a degree of consistency in evaluation standards. However,  the claim of a perfectly standardized methodology applied uniformly across all nations requires nuance. While FATF strives for consistency, variations in national contexts and legal frameworks can influence the application and interpretation of the evaluation criteria.

The UNODC, while serving as the secretariat for UNTOC, also undertakes various independent initiatives to combat transnational organized crime, such as the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) and the Global Firearms Programme (GFP). The statement incorrectly limits the UNODC’s role to merely administrative functions, ignoring its proactive engagement in combating transnational crime.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Group of Seven (G7):**

1. The G7 operates with a permanent, fixed structure, ensuring continuity and consistency in its policy initiatives across different presidencies.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative aiming to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, primarily focused on infrastructure projects in developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating presidency determines the annual agenda. This rotating system, while promoting inclusivity, can also lead to variations in policy focus and priorities across different years. The statement is incorrect because it presents a false sense of structural stability within the G7.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGII aims to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* nations, not developed ones.  The statement misrepresents the geographical target of the initiative, creating a significant factual error.  The initiative's focus on developing countries is a crucial aspect of its stated goals.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus's accession as the tenth member of the SCO marks a significant expansion of the organization's geographical reach, primarily focusing on enhancing economic cooperation within Central Asia.
2.  The SCO's cooperation programs, such as the Anti-Drug Strategy, are primarily reactive, addressing existing threats rather than proactively preventing them.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that Belarus's inclusion expands the SCO's reach. However, the SCO's focus is not limited to economic cooperation within Central Asia; it encompasses a broader range of security and political issues. The statement oversimplifies the organization's multifaceted objectives, focusing solely on one aspect of its activities.

Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While the SCO addresses existing threats, its strategies also incorporate proactive elements aimed at preventing future challenges.  The statement presents a skewed perspective by focusing exclusively on the reactive aspects, ignoring the proactive components within the SCO's framework.


**6. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, came into force in May 2024, granting BIMSTEC the status of an international organization with legal personality, but it lacks any enforcement mechanisms.
2.  BIMSTEC's focus areas are limited to trade, security, and connectivity, neglecting other important sectors like agriculture and people-to-people contact.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter grants legal personality, but the statement's assertion about lacking enforcement mechanisms is an oversimplification.  While BIMSTEC may not have the same robust enforcement capabilities as some other international organizations, it does have mechanisms for dispute resolution and cooperation to achieve its objectives.  The statement presents a misleadingly limited view of the Charter's implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  BIMSTEC's focus areas explicitly include agriculture and food security, as well as people-to-people contact.  The statement incorrectly omits crucial sectors, providing an incomplete and inaccurate picture of BIMSTEC's priorities.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ARF explicitly includes ASEAN Dialogue Partners in its discussions.  The statement misrepresents the ARF's membership, excluding a crucial component of its structure and function.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ASEAN Future Forum is designed as a common platform for ASEAN member states *and* partner countries to share ideas and policy recommendations. The statement incorrectly restricts participation to only ASEAN members, contradicting the Forum's stated inclusive nature.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the United Nations Security Council (UNSC):**

1. The UNSC’s decisions are non-binding recommendations, lacking the authority to impose legally obligatory actions on member states.
2.  The Common Pledge Initiative, launched at a UNSC debate, focuses solely on appointing women as lead mediators in peace processes, without considering other forms of women's participation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UNSC resolutions are binding under the UN Charter; member states are legally obligated to implement them. The statement fundamentally misrepresents the UNSC's authority and power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Common Pledge Initiative aims for the full, equal, and meaningful participation of women in peace processes, which encompasses more than just appointing them as lead mediators.  The statement narrows the scope of the initiative, omitting other crucial aspects of its objectives.


**9. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) solely focuses on nuclear material theft, excluding other forms of illicit trafficking of nuclear or radioactive materials.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB primarily tracks nuclear material theft, it also covers other forms of illicit trafficking involving nuclear and radioactive materials.  The statement presents a narrow and incomplete view of the ITDB's scope, omitting a significant portion of its data collection and analysis.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Atoms4NetZero considers the broader role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions, including applications beyond electricity generation.  The statement incorrectly limits the initiative's scope, failing to acknowledge its wider applications in other sectors.


**10. With reference to India's engagement with international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India's election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council signifies its commitment to regional supply chain resilience, but it excludes any involvement in addressing labor rights within these chains.
2. India's participation in the C-10 and L-69 Joint Ministerial Meeting demonstrates its engagement with multilateral diplomacy, but it lacks any specific focus on economic cooperation within these groupings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's participation in the IPEF Supply Chain Council includes a focus on labor rights, as evidenced by the inclusion of a Labor Rights Advisory Board within the framework. The statement wrongly implies a lack of attention to labor issues, contradicting the established structure of the initiative.

Statement 2 is an oversimplification. While the specific focus of the C-10 and L-69 meetings might not be solely economic, such cooperation is often a significant component of such multilateral engagements.  The statement assumes a lack of economic focus without sufficient evidence, potentially overlooking the implicit or explicit economic aspects of the discussions.


**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII, launched in 2022, aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects primarily in developed nations, focusing on sustainable and inclusive development.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII targets developing nations, not developed ones, as its primary focus is on addressing infrastructure gaps in these regions. While sustainability and inclusivity are key goals, the statement misrepresents the target recipient countries.

Statement 2 is correct.  The PGII aims to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects that directly support sustainable development goals in developing countries.  Renewable energy, digital infrastructure, and improved transportation are indeed key areas of focus, aligning with broader efforts to enhance economic growth and reduce inequalities.  The PGII functions as a supplementary initiative to existing multilateral development banks, not a replacement.


**2. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's recent call for Cuba's removal from the U.S. unilateral terrorism list reflects its consistent advocacy for the interests of the Global South.
2.  The U.S. unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism' primarily comprises nations with significant economic ties to the US, and inclusion on this list automatically triggers severe financial sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  NAM's stance on Cuba's inclusion on the U.S. terrorism list demonstrates its continued commitment to supporting nations often marginalized in global politics. The action underscores NAM's role as a voice for the Global South, advocating for fairer international relations and challenging unilateral actions by powerful nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the U.S. list does lead to significant economic and financial repercussions for listed countries, it doesn't exclusively target nations with substantial economic ties to the U.S.  The criteria for inclusion are based on alleged support for international terrorism, irrespective of the economic relationship with the United States. The sanctions are indeed severe, but the premise about the selection criteria is oversimplified.


**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is proportionally larger than its share of the total Commonwealth population.
2. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, has a dedicated focus on promoting sustainable tourism in Commonwealth member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is the largest member by population, representing nearly 60% of the total, its financial contribution is the fourth largest.  This means its financial contribution is not proportionally larger than its population share within the Commonwealth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is not specifically focused on sustainable tourism.  While its support for development initiatives might indirectly benefit the tourism sector in some member states, it doesn't have a dedicated focus on this area. The fund's objectives are broader in scope.


**4. With reference to India's measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation by streamlining the process of requests for legal assistance in criminal matters, including those related to tax evasion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FIU-IND plays a crucial role in India's anti-money laundering efforts by collecting, analyzing, and sharing financial intelligence with domestic and international agencies.  Its establishment in 2004 significantly strengthened India's capacity to combat financial crimes.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that the MLAT portal facilitates international cooperation, but it overstates its scope. While the portal streamlines requests for legal assistance in criminal matters, its primary focus is not on tax evasion specifically.  The portal's purpose is broader, encompassing various types of criminal investigations where international cooperation is needed.  Tax evasion might be included, but it's not the sole or primary focus.


**5. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report identifies cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The report highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") and the "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") as regions with the highest rates of drug production and trafficking.

Statement 1 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that Jagjit Pavadia from India has secured a third term on the INCB, running from 2025 to 2030. This demonstrates India's continued involvement in international drug control efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB does play a role in monitoring the legitimate pharmaceutical trade to prevent diversion of controlled substances for illicit purposes, its mandate is broader than simply regulating legal pharmaceuticals.  The INCB's core function is to monitor the implementation of the international drug control treaties and to make recommendations to states regarding drug control policies and practices.  Its focus extends to illicit drug trafficking, production, and consumption, encompassing a wide range of substances beyond pharmaceuticals.  The INCB's role in pharmaceutical monitoring is a component of its broader responsibilities, not its primary focus.


**2. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The 33rd Session of the CCPCJ focused on combating transnational organized crime and launched the "Generation Justice" initiative.
2. The CCPCJ is a specialized agency of the United Nations solely dedicated to countering cybercrime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The text clearly mentions that the 33rd session of the CCPCJ addressed transnational organized crime and initiated the "Generation Justice" program to engage youth in crime prevention.  This highlights the CCPCJ's role in tackling global criminal networks and promoting youth participation in justice systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CCPCJ is indeed part of the United Nations system, but it is not a specialized agency solely focused on cybercrime.  While cybercrime is a significant aspect of transnational organized crime and therefore falls under the CCPCJ's broader remit, the commission addresses a wider range of criminal justice issues, including drug trafficking, terrorism, and corruption.  Other UN bodies, such as the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), have more specialized mandates in areas like cybercrime.


**3. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

1.  India is a signatory to the UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention.
2. The UNTOC is supplemented by the UN Convention against Corruption, 2003, which solely focuses on financial crimes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that India has ratified the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention. This signifies India's commitment to international cooperation in combating organized crime.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UN Convention Against Corruption (2003) does indeed supplement the UNTOC, its scope is not limited to solely financial crimes.  The Convention addresses a broader spectrum of corrupt practices, including bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power.  Although financial crimes are a significant element of corruption, the Convention's provisions extend to various forms of corruption impacting various aspects of governance and societal functions.  The UNTOC and the UN Convention against Corruption work together to tackle the multifaceted nature of transnational organized crime and corruption.



**4. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

1. India has been elected to the steering committee of the GlobE network.
2. The GlobE network's primary objective is to facilitate international cooperation in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions India's election to the steering committee of the GlobE network, underscoring India's active participation in global anti-corruption initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While combating money laundering and terrorist financing are important components of anti-corruption efforts, the GlobE network's focus is broader than these specific financial crimes.  The GlobE network aims to strengthen international cooperation among law enforcement agencies to combat all forms of corruption, encompassing various types of corrupt practices, including bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power.  The GlobE network works to improve information sharing, enhance investigative capabilities, and promote the prosecution of corrupt individuals and organizations across borders. The fight against money laundering and terrorist financing is a part of this larger anti-corruption effort.


**5. Consider the following statements about the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline:**

1. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is directly connected to the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline for fuel supply.
2. The pipeline primarily transports natural gas from India to Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant and the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline are mentioned in the provided text as examples of recent developments in India-Bangladesh relations, there's no indication that they are directly connected for fuel supply.  The text mentions them separately as significant projects in energy cooperation.  It's possible they are related indirectly through the overall energy infrastructure, but a direct link is not established.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is an example of energy pipelines that exist between the two countries and it is transporting natural gas.  This exemplifies the growing energy cooperation between India and Bangladesh.


**6. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.
2. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam is primarily intended for domestic consumption within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the signing of a pact by Nepal, India, and Bangladesh to facilitate cross-border electricity trade. This demonstrates the increasing regional cooperation in the energy sector.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar is located entirely within India, its purpose is not solely for domestic consumption.  The text mentions it in the context of India-Bangladesh energy cooperation, implying that this corridor will likely play a role in supplying electricity to Bangladesh as part of broader regional energy initiatives.  The corridor's location within India doesn't preclude its role in international electricity trade.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF plenary in Singapore adopted India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), assessing its measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's MER is a periodic assessment conducted every five years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the FATF plenary in Singapore adopted India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), evaluating India's efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  This highlights the importance of international standards and peer review in assessing countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the passage does not explicitly state the frequency of India's MER assessments, it mentions that India's first MER was adopted in 2010.  The provided text does not contain information to confirm the assessment cycle.  The frequency of MER reviews can vary depending on the FATF's assessment methodology and the specific circumstances of each country.


**8. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identified cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 primarily focuses on illegal ivory trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the UNODC's World Drug Day report identified cannabis as the most widely abused drug worldwide. This underscores the global challenge of cannabis abuse and the need for effective drug control strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC does address wildlife crime, the provided text only mentions the release of the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 without specifying its primary focus.  The UNODC's work on wildlife crime encompasses a broad range of illegal activities involving various endangered species and their products.  To assume that the report primarily focuses on illegal ivory trade would be an oversimplification of the complex issue of wildlife crime.  The report likely covers a range of illegal wildlife trafficking activities.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Commonwealth:**

1. The Commonwealth established a sub-window under the India-UN Development Fund with $50 million over 5 years.
2. All decisions within the Commonwealth are made through a voting system, with each member having one vote.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly indicates that the Commonwealth established a sub-window under the India-UN Development Fund, allocating $50 million over a five-year period. This shows India's significant contribution and engagement within the Commonwealth framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that decisions within the Commonwealth are made by consensus, not through a voting system.  This reflects the organization's emphasis on collaboration and agreement among its diverse membership.  Each member's voice is considered equal in the decision-making process, aiming for a unified approach on various issues.  The consensus-based approach differs significantly from a voting system where decisions are made based on majority support.




**1. With reference to the Commonwealth of Nations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commonwealth Games, held in New Delhi in 2010, were organized under the aegis of the Commonwealth Secretariat.
2.  The India-UN Development Partnership Fund, established in 2018, allocates $50 million over five years exclusively to Commonwealth nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Commonwealth Games 2010 in New Delhi were indeed organized under the umbrella of the Commonwealth Games Federation, a body associated with the Commonwealth of Nations.  The Commonwealth Secretariat plays a supportive role in the organization of such events, providing guidance and coordination, but the actual operational responsibility lies with the Games Federation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the India-UN Development Partnership Fund was indeed established in 2018 with a $50 million allocation over five years, this fund is not exclusively dedicated to Commonwealth nations.  It supports development projects globally, focusing on areas aligned with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  The Commonwealth sub-window within the fund is only one aspect of its broader mandate.  The question attempts to mislead by linking the fund's existence to its exclusive use for Commonwealth countries.


**2. With reference to India's relations with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was initiated in 2003, marking the beginning of high-level political engagement between the two entities.
2.  The Joint Action Plan 2024-2028, adopted at the recent India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting, primarily focuses on enhancing military cooperation and joint defense exercises.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The initiation of the India-GCC Political Dialogue in 2003 represents a significant milestone in fostering high-level political interaction. This dialogue serves as a platform for discussing bilateral and regional issues of mutual concern.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 likely encompasses various aspects of bilateral cooperation, it is inaccurate to state that it primarily focuses on military cooperation and joint defense exercises. The plan likely covers a broader spectrum of areas, including trade, investment, energy, and cultural exchange, as part of the comprehensive strategic partnership between India and the GCC countries.  The question uses a deliberate misdirection by exaggerating the military component of the plan.



**3. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) is primarily aimed at facilitating electricity trade between India and Nepal.
2. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are joint ventures between India and Bhutan, designed to enhance energy security in both nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor is designed to improve power connectivity within India, primarily between the states of Bihar and Assam, and not primarily for India-Nepal electricity trade. Although it could indirectly facilitate regional energy exchange, it's not its central purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily collaborations between India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan. These projects aim to bolster Nepal's energy infrastructure and facilitate electricity export to India. The question uses subtle wordplay to confuse the reader about the participating countries.


**5. With reference to India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Exercise Harimau Shakti" is a bilateral military exercise between India and Malaysia focused on counter-terrorism strategies.
2.  India's acceptance of UPI payments in Malaysia significantly enhances the ease of financial transactions between the two countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Exercise Harimau Shakti is a significant bilateral military exercise between India and Malaysia, focusing on enhancing cooperation in areas such as counter-terrorism, joint operations, and military training.  The name itself (Harimau meaning tiger in Malay) hints at a joint military exercise.

Statement 2 is correct. The acceptance of UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payments in Malaysia simplifies financial transactions for Indian citizens in Malaysia and potentially for Malaysian citizens using Indian systems.  This initiative promotes greater economic integration and convenience.


**6.  With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The tripartite agreement signed in 2016 for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port involved India, Iran, and Pakistan.
2.  Chabahar Port's strategic location enables it to serve as a gateway to Central Asia for India, thereby reducing reliance on traditional routes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The tripartite agreement for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port was signed between India, Iran, and Afghanistan, not Pakistan. The omission of Pakistan reflects geopolitical considerations.

Statement 2 is correct. Chabahar Port's strategic location on the Gulf of Oman provides India with a direct sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan and offering a significant alternative to traditional routes. This is a key element of India's connectivity strategy in the region.


**7. With reference to BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, came into force in May 2024, granting BIMSTEC legal personality under international law.
2.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity exclusively focuses on developing road infrastructure among member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter in May 2024 marked a significant step in strengthening the organization's legal framework and providing it with a legal personality under international law. This enhances its capacity for international cooperation and engagement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a crucial initiative, it is not limited to road infrastructure.  It encompasses a broader range of transport modalities, including railways, waterways, and airways, to improve regional connectivity. The statement narrows the scope of the plan to mislead.


**8. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focuses solely on combating breast cancer in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to promote sustainable port infrastructure development through technology and financial assistance.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership, while focusing on cancer, has a broader scope than just breast cancer. It is designed to address various types of cancers, including cervical cancer, prevalent in the Indo-Pacific region.  The statement reduces the scope to create a distractor.

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon by both countries.
2.  The Depsang Plains, located southeast of Daulat Beg Oldie, are strategically significant due to their proximity to key military routes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC between India and China is not formally demarcated and there is no mutually agreed-upon LAC.  This lack of clear demarcation is a major source of tension and disputes between the two countries.  The statement presents a false claim about the LAC's status.

Statement 2 is correct. The Depsang Plains hold significant strategic importance for both India and China due to their location and proximity to key military routes and high-altitude passes.  Control over this area has major implications for military positioning and maneuverability.


**10. With reference to India's engagement with the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term signifies India's continued commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking.
2. The INCB is a specialized agency of the United Nations, primarily focused on regulating the production and trade of legal pharmaceuticals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election reflects India's sustained commitment to international cooperation in combating the global drug problem and its contribution to the INCB's efforts.  This highlights India's role in global drug control initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB plays a role in monitoring the legal pharmaceutical trade, its mandate is broader than simply regulating legal pharmaceuticals. It is primarily concerned with controlling the production and trafficking of illicit drugs and monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties. The statement incorrectly limits the INCB's focus.


**11. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, launched by the CCPCJ, exclusively focuses on rehabilitating juvenile offenders.
2. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a key legal instrument used to combat transnational organized crime.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GenJust initiative, while involving youth, has a broader scope than solely rehabilitating juvenile offenders.  It aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice more generally, including promoting awareness and participation in justice reform.  The statement inappropriately restricts the initiative's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention, is a crucial international treaty that provides a framework for combating transnational organized crime, including money laundering, drug trafficking, and terrorism financing.  It is a cornerstone of international efforts to address these complex crimes.


**12. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan, renewed in 2007, grants India significant influence over Bhutan's foreign policy.
2. Gelephu Mindfulness City, a planned international city in Bhutan, will primarily serve to improve connectivity with India's northeastern states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct but misleading. While the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation does involve close cooperation, it does not grant India complete control over Bhutan's foreign policy. Bhutan maintains its sovereign decision-making capacity, although the treaty reflects the close and special relationship between the two countries.  The statement exaggerates India's influence.

Statement 2 is correct. The planned Gelephu Mindfulness City is intended to significantly improve connectivity between Bhutan and India, particularly focusing on the northeastern states, facilitating trade and people-to-people contact.


**13. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives aimed to strengthen the Maldives' ties with China and reduce its dependence on India.
2. The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives primarily aims to help the Maldives diversify its foreign exchange reserves.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was a political movement advocating for a reduction of India's influence in the Maldives and a closer alignment with China. This campaign reflected the complex dynamics of geopolitical competition in the Indian Ocean region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While diversification is a benefit of CSAs, the primary aim of the CSA between India and the Maldives is to help the Maldives manage its foreign exchange reserves and maintain financial stability, particularly during times of economic stress.  The statement misrepresents the central purpose of the agreement.


**14. With reference to India's participation in international economic frameworks, consider the following statements:**

1. India's role as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council is focused solely on promoting digital trade and e-commerce.
2. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) includes a Crisis Response Network to address disruptions in regional supply chains.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Statement 2 is correct. The SCO's cooperation programs cover a wide range of areas, but counter-terrorism, economic development, and cultural exchange are prominent themes reflecting the organization's multifaceted approach to regional security and cooperation.  The statement correctly identifies major areas of focus.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on economics and international relations, adhering to all specified criteria:


**1. With reference to India's bilateral relations with Nepal, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship forms the basis of the special relationship between India and Nepal, emphasizing mutual respect and cooperation.
2.  India is Nepal's largest trading partner, consistently maintaining a trade deficit with Nepal due to its substantial imports of Nepalese goods.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship is a cornerstone of India-Nepal relations, establishing a framework for cooperation and mutual respect.  However, the treaty has been subject to reinterpretations and debates in recent years, particularly concerning border disputes and trade imbalances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is Nepal's largest trading partner, India consistently maintains a *trade surplus* with Nepal, not a deficit. This is because India exports significantly more goods to Nepal than it imports.  Nepal's reliance on Indian goods and the imbalance of trade have been points of contention in the bilateral relationship.  The significant trade imbalance highlights Nepal's economic dependence on India, a factor that influences the dynamics of their relationship.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India-China relations:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon, preventing any ambiguity in border demarcation.
2.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was a significant escalation in tensions, marking the deadliest border clash between the two countries since the 1962 war.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC between India and China is *not* formally demarcated and remains a subject of dispute.  The absence of a mutually agreed-upon boundary line is a major source of friction and periodic tensions between the two nations.  Different interpretations of historical maps and territorial claims contribute to the ongoing disagreements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Galwan Valley clash of 2020 was a significant escalation in the India-China border conflict, resulting in casualties on both sides and marking the deadliest incident since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.  This event underscored the fragility of peace along the LAC and highlighted the need for effective mechanisms to prevent future clashes.


**3. With reference to India's engagement with Bhutan, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2007 renewal of the 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation significantly altered the power dynamics between India and Bhutan, granting Bhutan greater autonomy in its foreign policy.
2.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, primarily due to the free trade agreement (FTA) signed in 2016, which has led to a substantial increase in bilateral trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 2007 renewal of the 1949 treaty did clarify certain aspects of the relationship and acknowledge Bhutan's sovereignty, it did not fundamentally alter the power dynamics. India continues to play a significant role in Bhutan's security and development.  The treaty's impact on Bhutan's foreign policy autonomy remains a subject of ongoing discussion and analysis.

Statement 2 is correct. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner. The 2016 FTA has facilitated increased trade between the two countries, although the overall trade balance remains significantly in India's favor. The FTA, while beneficial, has not completely eliminated the trade imbalance between the two nations.


**4. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) is primarily intended to enhance electricity trade between India and Bangladesh, improving energy security in both countries.
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects, located in Nepal, are primarily aimed at meeting Nepal's domestic energy needs and reducing its dependence on imported energy.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor is a major initiative to boost electricity trade between India and Bangladesh. This project aims to enhance regional energy security and reduce reliance on other sources. The increased electricity trade will contribute to improved energy access and economic development in both nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Arun III and Upper Karnali projects will benefit Nepal, a significant portion of the electricity generated is intended for export to India. These projects are examples of cross-border energy cooperation, aimed at meeting India's growing energy demands and providing Nepal with revenue.  The projects are significant for both countries' energy security and economic development.


**5.  Consider the following statements about the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km long multi-modal transport network primarily aimed at connecting India with Central Asia, bypassing the traditional routes through the Suez Canal.
2.  The INSTC initiative involves only India, Iran, and Russia, limiting its scope to these three nations and excluding other regional players.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the description of the FATF's MER is accurate, the year of India's first adopted MER is incorrect.  The date given is 2000, while the actual date is 2010.  This seemingly minor detail tests the candidate's ability to recall precise information, highlighting the importance of accurate chronological knowledge in international financial regulations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The statement accurately lists key legislative frameworks and institutions involved in India's anti-money laundering efforts.  This demonstrates the candidate's understanding of India's domestic mechanisms for combating financial crimes.  The contrast between the incorrect date in statement 1 and the accurate information in statement 2 makes option (b) the only logical choice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is *not* a formally demarcated border; it's a de facto boundary, and the division into sectors is not solely based on the McMahon Line.  The statement simplifies a complex geopolitical reality, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the India-China border dispute.

Statement 2 is correct. The description of differing claims on the LAC in the Western Sector, referencing the Johnson and McDonald Lines, is accurate. This demonstrates the candidate's knowledge of the historical basis of the border dispute in Ladakh. The contrast between the inaccurate simplification in statement 1 and the precise detail in statement 2 makes (b) the only possible answer.  The question requires a nuanced understanding of the India-China border issue.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The statement correctly identifies TEPA as India's first FTA with EFTA and accurately reflects its stated objectives regarding FDI and job creation.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of recent trade agreements and their economic implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While TEPA does include provisions for MRAs and does aim for substantial tariff reduction, the percentage of tariff elimination on India's exports is slightly different from the figure given in the statement.  The statement contains a deliberate numerical error to test the candidate's attention to detail. The discrepancy in the stated percentage of tariff elimination serves as a key distractor.

2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and the process involves a peer review by FATF members,  with subsequent updates based on  periodic reviews and assessments of the country's compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a significant concern, it's not explicitly included within the core mandate of the MER as defined by the FATF.  The focus remains on financial crimes and their links to broader security threats.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010. The process is a peer review conducted by FATF member states, ensuring a degree of international scrutiny and accountability.  The assessment isn't a one-time event;  India's compliance and effectiveness are subject to ongoing monitoring and periodic reviews, leading to updates and revisions of the MER.  This reflects the dynamic nature of financial crime and the need for continuous adaptation of countermeasures.  The iterative nature of the MER ensures that assessments remain relevant and capture evolving threats and national responses.

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 highlighted cocaine as the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focused primarily on the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horn, neglecting other forms of wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Day report correctly identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally,  not cocaine.  The report provides a comprehensive overview of global drug trends, including the prevalence of opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, but cannabis holds the top position in terms of abuse. This highlights the significant public health challenge posed by cannabis use worldwide.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 likely addresses the illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn, it is inaccurate to say it *primarily* focuses on these and *neglects* other forms.  The report usually offers a broader perspective on various aspects of wildlife crime, encompassing a wide range of species and illegal activities.  The report's scope extends beyond a limited number of species, reflecting the multifaceted nature of wildlife trafficking and its impact on biodiversity and global security.


**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported a significant decrease in incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023 compared to previous years, showing increased global security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  AFSPA is indeed applied to specific areas facing high levels of insurgency, and its extension is subject to government review and assessment. This reflects the targeted nature of the act and the need to periodically evaluate its necessity and effectiveness in maintaining security. The government's decision to extend or revoke AFSPA in certain areas is based on a careful consideration of the prevailing security situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While AFSPA does grant extensive powers to the armed forces, including arrest without warrants and the use of lethal force under specific circumstances, it also includes the power to conduct searches without warrants.  This aspect of the act has been a subject of significant debate and criticism, highlighting concerns about potential human rights violations.  The broad powers granted under AFSPA have been a source of controversy, emphasizing the importance of balancing national security concerns with fundamental rights.


**7. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Singapore's Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, established in 2024, is primarily focused on defense cooperation, neglecting economic and technological collaboration.
2.  "Project Nexus," a collaborative initiative between Singapore and India, aims to integrate their domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) to facilitate cross-border payments, but excludes the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text highlights that the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and Singapore encompasses a wide range of areas, including trade, economic cooperation, and technological collaboration, not just defense. The partnership reflects the multifaceted nature of the relationship and the shared interests of both countries in various domains.

This indicates an active role with decision-making responsibilities, not a limited observation role.  The Vice-Chairmanship position reflects India's significant engagement and influence within the council.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement established a Labor Rights Advisory Board to address labor rights and workforce development in regional supply chains.  This demonstrates a commitment to incorporating labor rights considerations into the framework's overall objectives.  The inclusion of the Labor Rights Advisory Board reflects a broader understanding of sustainable and ethical supply chain practices.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While global economic growth is a factor, OPEC+'s decision to extend oil output cuts is likely influenced by a multitude of factors, including geopolitical considerations, market dynamics, and the individual interests of member countries.  Attributing the decision solely to concerns about global economic growth is an oversimplification.  The decision is a complex one, shaped by various interacting forces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. OPEC+ includes oil-producing nations from various regions, not just the Middle East and Africa. Its membership reflects a broader geographical representation within the global oil market.  The inclusion of countries from different regions underscores the global nature of oil production and the need for international cooperation in managing this crucial resource.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While the FATF addresses broader financial crime issues, the MER specifically focuses on these three core areas.  The scope of the MER does not explicitly exclude cybercrime, but it's primarily focused on the financial aspects of these crimes. Cybercrime is dealt with by other international and national bodies.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The FIU-IND was indeed established in 2004, and the ED in 1956. Both play crucial roles in India's anti-money laundering efforts. The statement accurately reflects their roles and establishment years.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with the highest consumption in the "Golden Triangle" region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The UNODC's World Drug Day report does indeed highlight cannabis as the most widely abused drug, followed by the substances listed. However, the statement incorrectly states that the highest consumption is in the "Golden Triangle". While the Golden Triangle (now termed the Death Triangle) is a significant drug-producing region, the report doesn't necessarily pinpoint it as having the highest *consumption*.  The report focuses on production and trafficking patterns as much as consumption data which varies greatly across regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the "Death Crescent" is a significant area for illicit activities, including drug trafficking, the UNODC's report doesn't claim it's a *major* hub for wildlife crime that *exceeds* the impact of the "Triple Frontier Area."  The relative importance of these regions in wildlife crime varies depending on the specific species and type of crime considered. The statement presents an oversimplification and an inaccurate comparison of the two regions' roles in wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA's objective is accurately described,  but the claim that India holds a trade surplus with ASEAN is false.  India consistently experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the trade balance between the two entities.

Statement 2 is correct. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting did indeed take place to review AITIGA and to explore ways to address the persistent trade deficit that India faces with ASEAN.  The focus on reducing the deficit is a key element of these meetings.


**4. With reference to the Currency Swap Agreements (CSAs) of India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's CSA with SAARC nations, announced for 2024-2027, aims to enhance regional financial stability by providing a mechanism for exchanging currencies at a fixed rate, primarily focusing on the Indian Rupee.
2.  Other significant CSAs for India include the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement (signed in 2015) and a bilateral CSA with Japan amounting to $75 billion, but excludes any agreement with UAE.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. India's CSA with SAARC nations does aim to improve regional financial stability by facilitating currency exchanges at pre-determined rates.  While the focus isn't exclusively on the Indian Rupee (as multiple currencies are involved), the statement's central point regarding the agreement's purpose is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement and the India-Japan CSA are correctly mentioned, the statement wrongly claims that there's no CSA with the UAE.  India does indeed have a CSA in place with the UAE.  The exclusion of this important CSA makes the statement inaccurate.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. IPEF, launched in 2022, includes India and 13 other partners, and established three bodies: a Supply Chain Council, a Crisis Response Network, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board to bolster supply chain resilience.
2.  India's role as Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses primarily on enhancing labor standards and promoting sustainable supply chain practices within the South Asian region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IPEF's structure and the establishment of the three bodies are accurately described.  The statement correctly identifies India as a participant and the key functions of the established bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the Supply Chain Council does indeed consider labor standards and sustainability, India's role as Vice-Chair isn't *primarily* focused on the South Asian region. The IPEF's scope is much broader, encompassing the Indo-Pacific region. The statement incorrectly limits the geographical focus of India's role.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  At the 24th SCO summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, Belarus became the 10th member, and the summit adopted a cooperation program to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism for 2025-2027, but not an anti-drug strategy.
2. The SCO's Development Strategy until 2035 prioritizes economic cooperation among member states,  with a particular emphasis on infrastructure development and energy security, while downplaying initiatives related to cultural exchange.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The statement inaccurately claims that an anti-drug strategy wasn't adopted. The summit *did* adopt an anti-drug strategy for 2024-2029. The omission of this key outcome renders the statement false.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO's Development Strategy does focus on economic cooperation, the statement misrepresents its priorities.  The strategy encompasses a wide range of areas, including cultural exchange and people-to-people contact, alongside infrastructure and energy security.  The statement downplays the importance of cultural exchange and other non-economic aspects which are integral components of the strategy.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7, lacking a permanent structure, operates on a rotating presidency system, with the current presidency setting the annual agenda and initiatives, such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), focusing solely on infrastructure projects in developed nations.
2. The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, a G7-led effort, aims to facilitate access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa,  and excludes any focus on capacity building or technological transfer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The description of the G7's rotating presidency is accurate, but the claim that the PGII focuses *solely* on developed nations is false.  The PGII explicitly targets developing nations as beneficiaries of infrastructure investment.  This misrepresentation of the PGII's target audience makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative while focused on attracting investment, also incorporates elements of capacity building and technological transfer to ensure the long-term success and sustainability of the clean energy projects.  The statement's exclusion of these key aspects makes it inaccurate.


**8. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia, with both nations engaging in regular military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN.
2.  Recent developments in India-Bangladesh relations include Bangladesh joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, but excludes any significant energy cooperation projects between the two countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The statement accurately reflects the significant trading relationship between India and Bangladesh and their participation in joint military exercises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement about Bangladesh joining the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is accurate. However, it incorrectly states that there is no significant energy cooperation.  India and Bangladesh have several ongoing energy cooperation projects, including the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline and plans for electricity corridors.  The omission of these crucial projects makes the statement false.


**9. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The recently announced "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and Maldives focuses primarily on enhancing maritime security cooperation, with less emphasis on economic development initiatives.
2.  India's initiatives to strengthen relations with the Maldives include constructing a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll and providing grants for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs), but excludes any financial assistance through Currency Swap Agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While maritime security is a component of the partnership, the agreement equally emphasizes economic development and cooperation. The statement misrepresents the balance between the economic and security aspects of the partnership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement correctly mentions the Coast Guard base and HICDPs.  However, it omits the crucial element of financial assistance through Currency Swap Agreements (CSAs), which is a key aspect of India's support to the Maldives.  This omission makes the statement inaccurate.


**10. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. India, a signatory and party to the CWC, enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, which comprehensively addresses the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, including stringent provisions for civilian oversight.
2. The CWC, along with the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC), forms a key part of international efforts to prevent the use of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes any mechanism for addressing the misuse of dual-use technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. India is indeed a signatory to the CWC and enacted the relevant Act. However, the claim that the Act has "stringent provisions for civilian oversight" needs further clarification. While there are provisions for oversight, the level of civilian oversight might be a matter of interpretation and debate.  The statement makes an overly strong claim about the level of civilian oversight.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  The CWC, alongside the BWC and the Rome Statute, plays a significant role in international efforts to prevent weapons of mass destruction. However, the statement's claim that the framework excludes mechanisms for addressing the misuse of dual-use technologies is an oversimplification.  While there isn't a specific, singular mechanism, the conventions and related international agreements indirectly address this concern through various provisions and interpretations.  The statement is not entirely accurate in its absolute assertion of exclusion.


**1. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INCB's primary function is to monitor the implementation of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.
2.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election signifies India's continued commitment to global drug control efforts, having served two previous terms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The INCB's core mandate revolves around overseeing the implementation of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, along with other international drug control treaties.  It monitors the production, distribution, and consumption of controlled substances globally.  Its role goes beyond merely observing; it also provides recommendations and engages in capacity-building initiatives with member states.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Jagjit Pavadia's re-election demonstrates India's engagement with INCB and the global drug control framework,  the statement incorrectly implies a direct causal link between his re-election and a specific commitment level.  His re-election reflects the international community's recognition of his expertise and India's contribution to the INCB's work but doesn't inherently represent a higher level of commitment than previous terms.  The extent of India's commitment is better assessed through a broader analysis of its domestic drug policies and international collaborations beyond INCB membership.  Therefore, only statement 1 is completely accurate.


**2. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CCPCJ's 33rd session primarily focused on combating cybercrime and data breaches, given their increasing transnational nature.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to involve young people in the design and implementation of crime prevention strategies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cybercrime is a significant concern addressed by the CCPCJ, the 33rd session's primary focus was on combating Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) in its broader sense, encompassing various criminal activities.  Cybercrime falls under the umbrella of TOC but wasn't the sole or even primary focus. The question uses a deceptive tactic by focusing on a subset (cybercrime) of the larger issue the CCPCJ tackled.

Statement 2 is correct. The GenJust initiative is explicitly designed to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice. This proactive approach recognizes the importance of youth participation in shaping effective crime prevention strategies and fostering a sense of ownership and responsibility within communities.  It aims to harness the energy and perspectives of young people to create more inclusive and effective solutions. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the CCPCJ's activities.


**3. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. GlobE's primary objective is to facilitate international cooperation in asset recovery, focusing primarily on the repatriation of stolen assets to their countries of origin.
2. India's election to the steering committee of GlobE reflects its growing influence in global anti-corruption initiatives and its commitment to international cooperation in this domain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While asset recovery is a crucial aspect of GlobE's work, it's not its *primary* objective. GlobE's broader aim is to enhance international cooperation among anti-corruption law enforcement agencies, encompassing a wider range of activities beyond asset recovery, such as information sharing, investigative assistance, and capacity building.  The statement oversimplifies GlobE's multifaceted approach.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's election to the steering committee underscores its rising prominence in global anti-corruption efforts and its willingness to collaborate internationally to combat corruption. This reflects India's commitment to strengthening its own anti-corruption mechanisms and contributing to a more transparent and accountable global system. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the Commonwealth Sub Window, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, focuses primarily on promoting sustainable development goals in Commonwealth countries.
2.  The $50 million allocation over five years indicates India's significant financial commitment to strengthening the Commonwealth's development agenda.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund is indeed focused on supporting sustainable development initiatives within Commonwealth nations.  This alignment with the broader global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) makes it a key component of India's development cooperation efforts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The $50 million allocation represents a substantial financial commitment from India, highlighting its dedication to the Commonwealth and its development goals.  This financial contribution is a tangible demonstration of India's support for collaborative efforts within the Commonwealth framework.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**5. With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Joint Action Plan 2024-2028, adopted at the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, primarily focuses on enhancing energy security cooperation.
2. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue, held in 2003, established the framework for enhanced political cooperation between India and the GCC states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 covers a broad spectrum of areas, energy security is a significant component given the GCC's role as a major energy supplier and India's reliance on energy imports.  The plan likely includes measures to strengthen energy partnerships, diversify energy sources, and ensure stable energy supplies for India.

Statement 2 is also correct. The 2003 India-GCC Political Dialogue marked the beginning of a structured mechanism for political consultations and coordination between India and the GCC countries. This dialogue laid the foundation for subsequent engagements and agreements on various aspects of bilateral cooperation. Therefore, both statements accurately reflect the India-GCC relationship.


**6. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses the effectiveness of its measures to combat only money laundering and terrorist financing, excluding other financial crimes.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, plays a crucial role in gathering and disseminating financial intelligence to aid in investigations related to money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's MER under FATF assesses measures to combat not only money laundering and terrorist financing but also the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  This is a crucial aspect of the FATF's broader mandate to prevent illicit financial flows that could be used to support terrorism or the development of weapons.  The statement omits a key element of the evaluation.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND acts as a central hub for collecting and analyzing financial information relevant to money laundering and terrorist financing investigations.  It plays a pivotal role in coordinating efforts between various law enforcement agencies and facilitating international cooperation in this area.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**7. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most widely abused drug globally, surpassing cannabis in terms of prevalence.
2.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on the illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn, neglecting other forms of wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report clearly states that cannabis is the most abused drug globally.  The statement incorrectly assigns the top spot to cocaine, a significant error in factual recall regarding global drug abuse patterns.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report covers a much broader range of illegal wildlife activities than just ivory and rhino horn.  It typically addresses a wide array of wildlife trafficking issues, including the trade in endangered species and their parts, timber, and other natural resources. The statement severely restricts the scope of the report.  Therefore, both statements are inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, but allows for limited exceptions for legitimate peaceful purposes such as industrial production.
2. India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrates its commitment to the CWC's objectives and its willingness to comply with its provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CWC's core principle is a complete ban on chemical weapons. However, it does include provisions for exceptions for small quantities of certain chemicals used for legitimate, peaceful purposes, such as in industrial processes. These exceptions are carefully regulated and monitored to prevent misuse.

Statement 2 is also correct. India's ratification of the CWC and the subsequent enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, clearly demonstrate its commitment to the international norm against chemical weapons and its intention to adhere to the treaty's stipulations. This reflects India's responsible approach to international arms control agreements. Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**9. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants immunity from prosecution to armed forces personnel for actions taken in "disturbed areas," regardless of whether those actions are in accordance with the law.
2. The application of AFSPA is limited to Jammu and Kashmir, with no extension to other parts of the country.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. AFSPA grants significant powers to the armed forces, including the ability to open fire and arrest individuals without warrants in declared "disturbed areas." While there are legal frameworks and processes involved, the act does provide a level of immunity, making prosecution more difficult. The wording is carefully chosen to avoid making a definitive claim that prosecution is impossible under any circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA's application extends beyond Jammu and Kashmir to parts of other states including Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh.  The statement wrongly restricts the geographical scope of the act, a significant factual inaccuracy.  Therefore, only statement 1 is partially correct.


**10. With reference to the India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) allows the militaries of both countries to use each other's bases for logistical support but does not extend to the sharing of sensitive intelligence.
2. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been invoked against India, despite the US expressing concerns about certain defense deals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. LEMOA primarily focuses on logistical support, facilitating the use of each other's bases for maintenance, repairs, and resupply. While it improves interoperability, it doesn't automatically lead to the sharing of intelligence, which is usually governed by separate agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While CAATSA has not yet been fully invoked against India, the US has explicitly expressed concerns and issued warnings about potential sanctions regarding certain defense deals, highlighting the potential for future CAATSA implications.  The statement presents an oversimplification of a complex situation.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council is solely focused on reducing reliance on China for critical inputs and building alternative supply chains.
2. The Crisis Response Network under the IPEF aims to facilitate joint responses to supply chain disruptions, including natural disasters and geopolitical instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While reducing reliance on any single source of critical inputs is a goal of the IPEF, the Supply Chain Council's focus is broader than solely targeting China. It aims to enhance the resilience and diversification of supply chains across the Indo-Pacific region, encompassing various factors beyond geopolitical considerations.  The statement presents a narrow interpretation of the council's goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The Crisis Response Network is designed to coordinate responses to supply chain disruptions stemming from a variety of sources, including natural disasters, geopolitical events, pandemics, and other unforeseen circumstances.  This collaborative approach aims to mitigate the impact of disruptions and ensure the smooth flow of goods and services.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**12. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO significantly expands the organization's geographic reach into Central Asia and strengthens its influence in the region.
2. The SCO's focus on combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism is primarily directed towards addressing threats emanating from Afghanistan and Pakistan.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus's inclusion expands the SCO's geographical footprint and increases its overall influence in the Eurasian region. This reflects the evolving geopolitical dynamics and the SCO's role as a significant regional organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Afghanistan and Pakistan are regions of concern, the SCO's counter-terrorism strategy is not solely focused on these two countries.  It addresses broader transnational threats, recognizing that terrorism and extremism are global challenges requiring a multilateral approach.  The statement oversimplifies the scope of the SCO's counter-terrorism efforts. Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**13. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions primarily focus on protecting combatants during armed conflict, with minimal provisions for civilians.
2.  The Additional Protocols to the Geneva Conventions expand the scope of IHL to cover internal armed conflicts and introduce new emblems for humanitarian organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions are fundamentally concerned with protecting both combatants and non-combatants (civilians) during armed conflict.  The protection afforded to civilians, particularly in occupied territories, is a crucial aspect of the Conventions.  The statement misrepresents the core principles of IHL.

Statement 2 is correct. The Additional Protocols, particularly Protocol II, specifically address the protection of victims in non-international armed conflicts (internal conflicts), extending the reach of IHL beyond international conflicts.  Protocol III introduced the Red Crystal as an additional emblem for humanitarian organizations. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of measures against drug trafficking.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key institutions established to combat money laundering in India, with FIU-IND established before ED.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) explicitly assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While drug trafficking is a significant concern related to financial crimes, it's not explicitly stated in the provided text that it is *excluded* from the MER assessment.  The scope of the MER is broad, encompassing various financial crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both FIU-IND and ED are crucial in combating money laundering, the FIU-IND was established *after* the ED. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956, while the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004.  This reversal of the chronological order is a key point of error in the statement.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, and highlights the Golden Crescent (now renamed Death Crescent) as the region most affected by opioid production.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 is a key report released alongside the Annual Report on World Drug Day.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the UNODC report does indeed identify cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by the other drugs listed, it names the *Golden Crescent* (renamed Death Crescent) as a region significantly affected by illicit drug trafficking, primarily opioids.  The statement incorrectly states it's the *most* affected region, a detail not explicitly supported by the provided information.  The Triple Frontier Area and the Golden Triangle (Death Triangle) are also highlighted as regions significantly impacted by drug abuse.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly mentions that the UNODC released both the Annual Report on World Drug Day and the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.


**3. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's recent re-election to the INCB marks his second term.
2. The INCB is a UN agency responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that Jagjit Pavadia has been re-elected to the INCB for his *third* term, not his second.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates the correct answer from the incorrect options.

Statement 2 is correct. While the text doesn't explicitly state the INCB's monitoring function,  it is implicitly understood that a body responsible for overseeing international drug control would inherently monitor treaty implementation.  The INCB's role is to monitor and assess the implementation of the international drug control treaties.


**4. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The 33rd Session of the CCPCJ focused solely on combating transnational organized crime (TOC) and did not launch any new initiatives.
2. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a key mechanism to tackle TOC, and India is a signatory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 33rd Session of the CCPCJ did indeed focus on combating transnational organized crime (TOC), but it also launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice. This additional initiative demonstrates the incompleteness of statement 1.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a key mechanism to address TOC, and that India has ratified it.


**5. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. India's election to the GlobE Network's steering committee signifies its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts and its leading role in the network's founding.
2. The GlobE Network is primarily focused on sharing best practices and coordinating international efforts to combat corruption, facilitating mutual legal assistance and intelligence sharing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's election to the steering committee does demonstrate its commitment to anti-corruption efforts, the provided text doesn't suggest that India played a leading role in the network's founding.  The text only indicates India's recent election to the steering committee, not its foundational involvement.

Statement 2 is correct. The implicit function of a global network of anti-corruption authorities is to share best practices, coordinate international efforts, and facilitate cooperation, including mutual legal assistance and intelligence sharing.  This is a logical deduction based on the nature of such a network.


**6.  With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants disciplinary and administrative powers over serving or attached personnel to the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs), but excludes personnel from the Coast Guard.
2. An Inter-Services Organization (ISO) is defined as a body of troops including a Joint Services Command consisting of persons subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957, or any two of these Acts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act grants powers to the C-i-C and O-i-C over personnel within ISOs. The provided text doesn't specify whether the Coast Guard is explicitly excluded.  The statement makes an unsupported exclusion.

Statement 2 is correct. The text directly defines an ISO as described in the statement.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**7. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 1999 based on recommendations from a task force led by K.C. Pant and comprises the Prime Minister, Finance Minister, Defence Minister, Home Minister, and External Affairs Minister.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), provides long-term analysis and policy recommendations to the National Security Council (NSC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

2.  A sovereignty agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, signed in 1974, established Bangladesh's sole control over Saint Martin's Island.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  Firstly, Saint Martin's Island is located in the *northeastern* part of the Bay of Bengal, not the southwestern part. This geographical location is crucial for understanding its strategic significance. Secondly, the island is not jointly administered; it is under the *sole* sovereignty of Bangladesh. Statement 2 is correct.  The 1974 agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar definitively assigned sovereignty over Saint Martin's Island to Bangladesh, resolving any prior ambiguity.  The other options are incorrect as they misrepresent the island's location or the nature of its sovereignty.


**4. With reference to the Seine River, consider the following statements:**

1. The Seine River is France's longest river, flowing in a southeasterly direction through Paris before emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.
2. Major tributaries of the Seine River include the Marne, Aube, and Yonne rivers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the Marne, Aube, and Yonne are indeed tributaries, the Seine is *not* France's longest river; that distinction belongs to the Loire River. The direction of flow is also slightly inaccurate; it flows in a *northwesterly* direction, not southeasterly.  The statement's inaccuracy regarding length and direction makes it incorrect. Statement 2 is correct.  The Marne, Aube, and Yonne rivers are all significant tributaries of the Seine.  This detail correctly reflects the river's hydrological system. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracies present in statement 1.


**5.  With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia and is Africa's second-largest lake.
2. The primary water source for Lake Turkana is the Omo River, which originates in Ethiopia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Lake Turkana's location in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia is accurate, it is Africa's *fourth* largest lake, not the second-largest. This factual error renders the statement incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana. This hydrological connection is a crucial aspect of the lake's ecosystem and its dependence on the Ethiopian highlands.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the lake's size or fail to acknowledge the accuracy of statement 2.



**6. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Kenya and is the second-highest mountain in Africa.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano, characterized by its conical shape formed from layers of ash, lava, and rock.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in *Tanzania*, not Kenya.  It is also the *highest* mountain in Africa, not the second highest. These geographical inaccuracies render the statement incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano, formed by the accumulation of layers of volcanic material. This geological characteristic is a defining feature of its formation and structure. Thus, only statement 2 is accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent Kilimanjaro's location or its height, or they fail to recognize the accuracy of the geological description.


**7. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. Lipulekh Pass is located at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand.
2. The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the location in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand and its status as a trijunction point are correct, the third country is *Nepal*, not Bhutan.  This crucial geographical detail makes the statement inaccurate. Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass significantly shortens the travel distance and time for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.  This is a key aspect of its significance. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 1 regarding the trijunction countries.


**8. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, providing a shorter maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2.  The Suez Canal is located in Panama.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the *Mediterranean Sea* and the *Red Sea*, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. While it does indeed provide a shorter maritime route between Asia and Europe, the incorrect description of the oceans it connects makes the statement inaccurate. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Suez Canal is located in *Egypt*, not Panama. The Panama Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  Both statements contain significant geographical errors. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**9. With reference to the India-Nepal relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 establishes a framework for equal partnership between India and Nepal, with no special privileges for either nation.
2. India is Nepal's largest trading partner, and Nepal holds a significant trade surplus with India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 is a foundational agreement, it does grant India certain special privileges, particularly in matters of defense and security.  This makes the statement about equal partnership inaccurate. Statement 2 is also incorrect.  India is indeed Nepal's largest trading partner, but *India* holds a trade surplus with Nepal, not the other way around.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the nuances of the India-Nepal relationship.


**10. With reference to the India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan, signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007, grants India significant influence over Bhutan's foreign policy.
2. India is Bhutan's primary source of foreign direct investment (FDI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The 1949 treaty (renewed in 2007) does grant India significant influence in Bhutan's foreign policy. This is a key aspect of their bilateral relationship. Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is a major investor in Bhutan, it is not necessarily Bhutan's *primary* source of FDI.  Other countries might also contribute significantly to Bhutan's economic development through FDI.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.


**11. With reference to the India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives aimed to strengthen the Maldives' relationship with India and reduce its dependence on China.
2.  India's Operation Neer (2014) provided water assistance to the Maldives during a drought, and Vaccine Maitri supplied COVID-19 vaccines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign was a movement *against* increased Indian influence in the Maldives and sought to foster closer ties with China. This directly contradicts the statement. Statement 2 is correct.  Operation Neer and Vaccine Maitri were indeed humanitarian initiatives by India to assist the Maldives during times of crisis.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the details of the relationship.


**12. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chabahar Port is located on the Gulf of Oman and serves as a gateway for India to access Central Asian countries, bypassing Pakistan.
2. The development of Chabahar Port is solely an initiative undertaken by India, without collaboration from other countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The strategic location of Chabahar Port on the Gulf of Oman allows India to access Central Asian markets without relying on routes through Pakistan. This is a key aspect of its geopolitical significance. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The development of Chabahar Port involves collaborations with Iran and Afghanistan, making it a trilateral initiative.  Therefore, only statement 1 accurately reflects the facts.


**13. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transport network connecting India, Iran, and Russia, primarily focusing on rail transport.
2. The INSTC aims to create an alternative route for trade between India and Europe, bypassing the Suez Canal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the length and the involvement of India, Iran, and Russia are correct, the INSTC is a *multi-modal* transport network, not solely reliant on rail.  It utilizes various modes of transportation, including sea, rail, and road, to optimize efficiency. Statement 2 is correct.  A primary objective of the INSTC is to provide an alternative, shorter trade route between India and Europe that does not rely on the Suez Canal.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**14. With reference to the India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Malaysia is home to one of the largest Indian diasporas globally, second only to the United States.
2.  The primary focus of India-Malaysia defense cooperation is joint military exercises focused on land warfare.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Malaysia does have a significant Indian diaspora, it is the *third* largest globally, after the United States and the United Arab Emirates. This makes the statement inaccurate. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While joint military exercises are a part of India-Malaysia defense cooperation, the focus is not solely on land warfare; it encompasses a broader range of areas including naval and air exercises.  Therefore, neither statement is entirely accurate.



**1. With reference to the BRICS initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The New Development Bank (NDB), headquartered in Shanghai, aims to provide infrastructure funding exclusively to BRICS nations.
2. The BRICS Grain Exchange primarily focuses on enhancing food security within the BRICS community by establishing a fair trading system for agricultural products.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the New Development Bank (NDB) is headquartered in Shanghai and does fund infrastructure projects, its mandate extends beyond BRICS nations to include other emerging economies.  The NDB aims to ensure equal representation and voting power for all its members, reflecting a broader developmental focus than solely supporting BRICS countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The BRICS Grain Exchange, a Russian-led initiative, is specifically designed to create a more equitable and transparent trading system for agricultural products within the BRICS community. This directly addresses food security concerns within the BRICS nations by fostering fairer market access and potentially stabilizing prices.  The initiative aims to improve the reliability and resilience of food supplies within the member states.


**2. With reference to the ASEAN institutions, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1996 with India as a founding member.
2. The ASEAN Future Forum, proposed by Vietnam, serves as a platform for ASEAN member states and partner countries to share policy recommendations, with India as a founding member.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994, not 1996.  India joined the ARF in 1996, but it was not a founding member.  The ARF's primary objective is to foster dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues among ASEAN member states and their dialogue partners.

Statement 2 is correct. The ASEAN Future Forum, proposed by Vietnam at the 43rd ASEAN Summit in 2023, is indeed a platform for sharing new ideas and policy recommendations.  India is a founding member of this forum, highlighting its commitment to regional cooperation and engagement with ASEAN.  The forum's structure and operational mechanisms are still evolving.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF Supply Chain Council, where India holds the Vice-Chair position, focuses solely on crisis response and emergency management for supply chain disruptions.
2. The IPEF Clean Economy Agreement promotes clean energy technology development but excludes initiatives aimed at supporting MSMEs (Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IPEF Supply Chain Council's mandate is broader than just crisis response. While it does include a Crisis Response Network, its primary focus is on strengthening critical supply chains through various strategies, including risk mitigation, diversification, and resilience-building.  India's Vice-Chair position reflects its significant role in shaping these efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF Clean Economy Agreement actively promotes clean energy technology development *and* includes initiatives to support MSMEs.  This support often comes through investments and capacity-building programs designed to integrate Indian companies into global value chains and facilitate their participation in the clean energy transition.  The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund and IPEF Accelerator are examples of such initiatives.


**4. With reference to the  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 marked the organization's expansion to include 11 member states.
2. The SCO's cooperation programs exclusively focus on counter-terrorism efforts, neglecting other areas of regional cooperation such as economic development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Belarus did join the SCO, it became the 10th member state, not the 11th. The SCO's membership is comprised of eight founding members and two additional members, not eleven. The addition of Belarus expanded the SCO's geographical reach and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although counter-terrorism is a key focus for the SCO, its cooperation programs extend far beyond this area. The organization addresses various aspects of regional cooperation, including economic development, security, and cultural exchange.  The SCO actively works on initiatives related to trade, investment, and infrastructure development to promote regional economic growth.  The adoption of development strategies and other initiatives demonstrates a broader agenda than solely counter-terrorism.


**5. With reference to  the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 operates under a permanent, fixed structure with a dedicated secretariat to ensure continuity and consistency in its operations.
2. The G7's initiatives, such as the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), are exclusively focused on providing financial assistance to developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 does *not* have a permanent structure or a dedicated secretariat. Its operations are based on a rotating presidency system, meaning that the agenda and priorities are set annually by the country holding the presidency. This ensures flexibility but can also lead to variations in focus and outcomes over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The G7's initiatives, including the PGII, are aimed at addressing global challenges. While the G7 comprises developed nations, the PGII, for example, is explicitly designed to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* countries.  The focus is on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development to support global growth and development.  The initiative aims to mobilize significant investment to address infrastructure gaps in emerging economies.


**1. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) complete disciplinary and administrative authority over all personnel, both serving and attached, but only within the confines of their respective organizations.
2. An ISO is defined as a body of troops comprising personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957, or any combination of two of these Acts, and its jurisdiction extends to all aspects of military operations, including joint exercises and deployments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, indeed empowers the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with comprehensive disciplinary and administrative powers over serving and attached personnel within the ISO's structure.  However, the phrasing "but only within the confines of their respective organizations" is a slight oversimplification. While the primary focus is internal control, the act's implications might indirectly influence interactions with other branches during joint operations.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the definition of ISO as a body of troops under the purview of the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957, or any two of them, is accurate, the statement's assertion regarding the extent of its jurisdiction is too broad.  An ISO's authority primarily concerns internal administration and discipline; it doesn't automatically extend to overarching command during joint military exercises or deployments. Those operations would typically fall under the command structure of the specific exercise or deployment. The act clarifies internal command but doesn't create a new overarching command structure for all joint operations.

Therefore, only statement 1 is substantially correct, albeit with a minor caveat regarding the nuanced scope of authority.


**2. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 2001, following the recommendations of a task force led by K.C. Pant, to provide strategic analysis and policy recommendations exclusively to the Prime Minister.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), functions under the NSCS and is responsible for overseeing the implementation of national security policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. The NSCS was established in 1999, not 2001, based on the K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations.  Furthermore, the NSCS provides support to the entire National Security Council (NSC), not exclusively to the Prime Minister. The NSC is the apex advisory body.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The NSAB, while headed by the NSA, is a distinct entity that provides long-term analysis and policy recommendations to the NSC, not the NSCS. The NSCS is the secretariat providing administrative and support functions to the NSC and its constituent bodies. It doesn't oversee policy implementation; that responsibility rests with various government ministries and agencies.


Both statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the establishment date and the functional relationship between the NSAB and NSCS.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**3. With reference to Operation Vijay (1999), consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Talwar, a naval operation, involved a complete blockade of Pakistan's naval ports, preventing any naval support to Pakistani forces in Kargil.
2. Operation Safed Sagar, an air operation, primarily focused on targeting Pakistani ground positions in the Mushkoh Valley and Batalik sectors, utilizing precision-guided munitions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval operation, but it did not involve a complete blockade of Pakistani ports.  While the Indian Navy did deploy its assets to monitor and deter Pakistani naval activity, a full blockade was not implemented.  The focus was more on maintaining naval dominance and preventing any significant naval support to the Pakistani forces in Kargil rather than a complete blockage of ports.


Statement 2 is largely correct. Operation Safed Sagar was indeed an air operation that targeted Pakistani positions in Kargil. While the specific focus on Mushkoh Valley and Batalik sectors and the exclusive use of precision-guided munitions need further clarification (depending on the exact definition of "primarily" and "precision-guided munitions"), the core description of the operation's nature and objective is accurate.


Therefore, only statement 2 provides a substantially accurate depiction of Operation Vijay's components.


**4. With reference to the weaponization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of any weapons in space, including conventional arms, thus aiming for complete demilitarization of outer space.
2.  The term "militarization of space" refers exclusively to the deployment of weapons in space, differentiating it from the broader concept of using space for military purposes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on the moon, or other celestial bodies. It does not explicitly ban all weapons in space, leaving a gray area for conventional weaponry.  The treaty's focus was primarily on preventing an arms race in space involving WMDs, not a complete ban on all military activities.


Statement 2 is incorrect. "Militarization of space" encompasses a broader range of activities beyond weapon deployment. It includes the utilization of space-based assets for military intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications, navigation, and other supportive functions, even without deploying weapons directly into space. Weaponization is a subset of militarization.


Both statements misrepresent key aspects of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and the definitions of related terms.  Therefore, neither statement is correct.



**5. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under the CMF, involved the seizure of a significant quantity of narcotics in the Arabian Sea, demonstrating India's commitment to counter-narcotics operations within the CMF framework.
2. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on combating piracy and terrorism in the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, with its headquarters located in Bahrain.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's participation in CMF and its subsequent involvement in Operation Crimson Barracuda, resulting in a drug seizure, accurately reflects India's commitment to counter-narcotics efforts within the CMF's operational scope. The operation showcases India's active role in multinational maritime security cooperation.


Statement 2 is also correct. The CMF is indeed a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on combating piracy and terrorism. While its operational area is the Arabian Sea and the Indian Ocean, the headquarters location is accurate as well.


Both statements accurately reflect the role and activities of the CMF and India's participation in it. Therefore, both statements are correct.


**6. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in "disturbed areas," including the authority to arrest individuals without warrants and conduct searches without prior judicial authorization, but these powers are subject to judicial oversight and review.
2.  AFSPA's applicability extends to specified areas within Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, and its continued implementation in these regions is subject to periodic review and potential modification by the Central Government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AFSPA does grant the armed forces significant powers in disturbed areas, including the authority to arrest without warrants and conduct searches without prior judicial authorization, these powers are *not* subject to routine judicial oversight and review in the same way as standard law enforcement procedures. The immunity provided under AFSPA significantly limits the scope of judicial review.


Statement 2 is correct. AFSPA's applicability is limited to specific areas within the mentioned states, and the Central Government does periodically review and potentially modify its implementation based on security assessments and evolving circumstances.  The extension or revocation of AFSPA is a matter of government policy and is subject to ongoing evaluation.


Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the key aspects of the AFSPA.


**7. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear material theft, excluding any data on loss, unauthorized access, or other security-related events involving nuclear materials.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative utilizes nuclear techniques to enhance crop yields and improve food security globally, but it does not address challenges related to post-harvest losses or food distribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB is a comprehensive database that tracks a wide range of events related to nuclear material, including theft, loss, unauthorized access, and other security incidents. It's not limited solely to theft-related events.


Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the Atoms4Food initiative uses nuclear technology to improve crop yields, it also addresses broader challenges in food security, including post-harvest losses and aspects of food distribution.  The initiative aims for a holistic approach to food security, not just crop production.


Both statements contain significant inaccuracies regarding the scope of the IAEA's ITDB and Atoms4Food program. Therefore, neither statement is correct.


**8.  With reference to the International Solar Alliance (ISA), consider the following statements:**

1. The ISA was jointly launched by India and France in 2015, with its headquarters initially established in Paris before relocating to India.
2.  The ISA's primary mission is to mobilize US$1 trillion in investments for solar energy by 2030, primarily focusing on developing countries and promoting technology transfer.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The ISA was indeed jointly launched by India and France in 2015. However, while its headquarters were initially in Paris, it's now located in India (Gurgaon).  The statement's description of the relocation needs clarification.


Statement 2 is largely correct. The ISA's core mission is to mobilize significant investment (the US$1 trillion target by 2030 is an ambitious goal) in solar energy, with a particular focus on developing countries and facilitating technology transfer and capacity building.


While statement 1 requires a minor correction, statement 2 accurately reflects the ISA's primary objectives. Therefore, statement 2 is the more accurate of the two.


**9. With reference to the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance (GEEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The GEEA was launched at COP27 in Egypt, aiming to accelerate the global transition to renewable energy sources and enhance energy efficiency.
2. The GEEA's focus is primarily on promoting energy efficiency in developing countries, particularly in Africa, assisting with capacity building and technology transfer.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the GEEA aims to accelerate the global transition to renewable energy and enhance energy efficiency, it was not launched at COP27 in Egypt. The exact launch details need verification.


Statement 2 is correct. The GEEA's focus is indeed on developing countries, with a significant emphasis on Africa, providing support for capacity building and technology transfer to improve energy efficiency.


Therefore, only statement 2 reflects a core aspect of the GEEA's mission.



**10. With reference to the Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CAC, established in 1963, is responsible for setting international food safety standards and guidelines, but it lacks the authority to enforce these standards directly.
2. The CAC is a joint initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), and its members are primarily governments, with participation from other stakeholders, including industry representatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CAC does set international food safety standards and guidelines, but it doesn't have direct enforcement power.  Enforcement is the responsibility of individual national governments.


Statement 2 is also correct. The CAC is indeed a joint FAO/WHO initiative, with its membership composed mainly of governments, but also includes participation from other relevant stakeholders, such as industry representatives and international organizations.


Both statements accurately describe the CAC's role and structure.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council is solely responsible for addressing labor rights issues within regional supply chains.
2.  India's election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council signifies its significant role in strengthening critical supply chains within the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, it does so through multiple bodies, including the Labor Rights Advisory Board, which specifically addresses labor rights and workforce development.  The Council's mandate is broader than just labor rights.  The Crisis Response Network is also a key component, handling emergency responses to disruptions.  Therefore, attributing the responsibility solely to the Supply Chain Council is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election as Vice-Chair demonstrates its active participation and leadership role in IPEF's efforts to enhance the resilience and security of supply chains in the Indo-Pacific. This reflects India's growing influence in regional economic cooperation and its commitment to a rules-based order. The Vice-Chair position provides India with a platform to shape policy and contribute to the framework's overall goals.  This is a significant development for India's economic diplomacy in the region.



**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity within the Middle East, excluding Europe and India.
2.  The IMEC's primary goal is to reduce trade barriers between India and European nations while ignoring Middle Eastern countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The very name "India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor" (IMEC) clearly indicates its aim to improve connectivity between India, Middle Eastern countries, and Europe. The corridor is designed to foster economic cooperation and integration across these geographically diverse regions.  To state it's solely focused on the Middle East is a misrepresentation of its core objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IMEC's objective is broader than just reducing trade barriers between India and Europe. It aims to create a comprehensive economic corridor that facilitates trade and investment across all three regions, thereby improving connectivity and economic growth for all participants.  The statement misrepresents the IMEC's inclusive nature.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's primary focus is on military cooperation, neglecting economic and cultural initiatives.
2. Belarus's accession to the SCO significantly reduces the organization's influence on regional security and economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCO does address security concerns, including counter-terrorism, its scope extends far beyond military cooperation. The organization actively promotes economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people contacts among its member states.  The mention of initiatives like the Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism, and the Anti-Drug Strategy showcases this diversity of focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belarus's accession to the SCO is likely to *increase*, not decrease, the organization's influence.  Adding a new member expands the SCO's geographical reach and strengthens its collective weight in regional and international affairs.  This could enhance its capacity for economic cooperation and its ability to address security challenges more effectively.  The statement wrongly assumes expansion weakens the organization.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is exclusively focused on funding infrastructure projects in high-income countries.
2. The G7 operates with a fixed, permanent structure, ensuring consistent policy implementation across its member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII explicitly aims to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* nations,  promoting sustainable and inclusive development.  The initiative's focus on mobilizing significant funding for these projects directly contradicts the statement's claim. The focus on developing nations is a key aspect of the PGII's mandate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The G7 operates with a rotating presidency, meaning its structure is not fixed. Each member state holds the presidency for one year, setting the agenda for that period.  This rotating system ensures that the G7's priorities and focus may shift annually.  The statement incorrectly portrays a permanent, unchanging structure.


**5. With reference to India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India consistently maintains a trade surplus with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
2.  Remittances from GCC countries constitute a negligible portion of India's total remittances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text clearly states that India has a *trade deficit* with GCC countries, meaning it imports more from them than it exports.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual situation.  This highlights the imbalance in trade between India and the GCC region.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text specifies that GCC countries contribute a significant portion (30% in 2020-21) of India's total remittances.  This is a substantial figure, demonstrating the importance of these remittances to the Indian economy.  The statement minimizes the significant contribution of GCC remittances.


**6. With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Ukraine is currently a full member of NATO.
2.  NATO's funding mechanism relies solely on voluntary contributions from its member states, with no fixed formula.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Ukraine *applied* for NATO membership in 2022 but is *not* yet a member.  The statement incorrectly asserts Ukraine's current membership status.  This reflects the ongoing geopolitical complexities surrounding Ukraine and NATO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NATO's funding involves contributions from all members, it's based on a formula related to Gross National Income (GNI).  This means there is a structured, albeit not entirely rigid, system for determining each member's financial contribution.  The statement misrepresents the structured nature of the funding mechanism.



**7. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2019 with the primary objective of eliminating all trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2. India maintains a trade surplus with the ASEAN countries due to AITIGA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2019.  Furthermore, while it aims to reduce trade barriers, it doesn't eliminate *all* of them.  The statement contains errors in both the year and the extent of trade barrier reduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text indicates that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, meaning it imports more from ASEAN than it exports.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual trade balance.  This illustrates the ongoing trade dynamics between India and the ASEAN bloc.


**8. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. SAARC's decision-making process relies on a majority vote system to ensure efficient resolutions.
2. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement, a key SAARC initiative, has significantly reduced trade barriers among all SAARC member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SAARC operates on a principle of *unanimity*, meaning all member states must agree on any decision.  A majority vote system does not exist within SAARC's decision-making framework.  This highlights the challenges of consensus-building in regional organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SAFTA aimed to reduce trade barriers, its effectiveness has been limited due to various factors, including political tensions among member states.  The statement oversimplifies the complexity of regional trade dynamics and the challenges faced by SAFTA.


**9. With reference to India's initiatives for the Global South, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Social Impact Fund allocates $100 million to support digital public infrastructure (DPI) in the Global South.
2. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum focuses primarily on promoting tourism and cultural exchange.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India's contribution to the Social Impact Fund for accelerating DPI in the Global South is $25 million, not $100 million.  The statement misrepresents the actual amount allocated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum's primary objective is education and capacity building, not tourism and cultural exchange, although these aspects may be included as part of a broader program.  The statement focuses on a secondary aspect, misrepresenting the core objective.


**10. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), consider the following statements:**

1. IPOI is a legally binding treaty-based arrangement promoting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.
2. IPOI's philosophy is entirely separate from India's 'Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)' initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPOI is explicitly described as a *non-treaty-based*, voluntary arrangement.  The statement presents the opposite of IPOI's actual nature.  This highlights the difference between legally binding and voluntary international cooperation mechanisms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that IPOI *builds upon* India's SAGAR initiative.  The statement inaccurately portrays them as unrelated.  This demonstrates how different initiatives can be interconnected and build upon each other's objectives.


**11. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EFTA is a customs union similar to the European Union (EU).
2.  The India-EFTA TEPA aims to establish a common external tariff for all member states of both India and EFTA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that EFTA is *not* a customs union, unlike the EU.  EFTA members maintain their own external tariffs for countries outside the association.  The statement incorrectly equates EFTA's structure with that of the EU.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The TEPA does not aim to establish a common external tariff.  EFTA members retain their individual external tariffs, a key characteristic differentiating it from a customs union.  The statement misrepresents a core characteristic of the EFTA's structure and the nature of the agreement.


**12. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's primary focus is on military alliances and interventions in global conflicts.
2. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list reflects its focus on the interests of developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAM's core principle is non-alignment with major power blocs, focusing on peaceful coexistence and avoiding military entanglements.  The statement misrepresents NAM's fundamental principle of non-alignment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAM's support for Cuba highlights its advocacy for the interests of *developing* nations and its opposition to unilateral sanctions.  The statement misinterprets NAM's support for Cuba as reflecting the interests of developed nations.  The focus on Cuba's situation is linked to NAM's commitment to the Global South.


**13. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the smallest member of the Commonwealth in terms of population.
2. The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is funded entirely by the UK government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India is the *largest* member of the Commonwealth in terms of population, representing nearly 60% of its total population.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window is funded by India through the India-UN Development Fund, not the UK government.  The statement misattributes the source of funding for this initiative.


**14. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) only tracks nuclear material theft incidents within a limited number of countries.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program focuses on promoting nuclear weapons development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB tracks nuclear material theft incidents across *many* states (31 are mentioned in the text).  The statement understates the scope of the ITDB's data collection.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atoms4Food program focuses on using nuclear techniques to *improve* global food security, not on weapons development.  The statement misrepresents the program's objectives.  This contrasts the peaceful applications of nuclear technology with the misuse for weapons.


**15. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments at the individual level rather than the country level.
2.  The GCI 2024 report indicates that India is among the least prepared countries in terms of cybersecurity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments at the *country* level, not the individual level.  The statement misrepresents the level of analysis used in the GCI report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India is among the "role modelling" countries (Tier 1), demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual assessment of India's cybersecurity preparedness.  This highlights India's efforts in the field of cybersecurity.


**16.  With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently holds a trade deficit with the United States.
2. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India has a *trade surplus* with the US, meaning it exports more than it imports.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual trade balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2023.  The statement contains an error regarding the signing date of this important defense agreement.  This highlights the importance of accurate chronology in understanding the evolution of bilateral relations.


**17. With reference to the G4 nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The G4 nations are actively working to oppose reforms of the United Nations Security Council.
2. The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group supports the G4 nations' bid for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G4 nations are actively advocating for *reforms* to the UN Security Council, seeking permanent seats.  The statement contradicts their stated objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UfC group *opposes* the G4 nations' bid for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.  The statement misrepresents the UfC's position on the G4's proposal.  This highlights the differing perspectives within the international community on UN Security Council reform.


**18. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC issued arrest warrants only for political leaders and not for military commanders involved in war crimes.
2.  Member states of the ICC are not obligated to comply with arrest warrants issued by the Court.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text mentions arrest warrants issued by the ICC against both political leaders (e.g., Russia's President) and leaders of armed groups (Hamas).  The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the ICC's actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Member states *are* obligated to comply with arrest warrants issued by the ICC.  Failure to comply can have significant consequences.  The statement misrepresents the legal obligations of ICC member states.


**19. With reference to BRICS, consider the following statements:**

1. The New Development Bank (NDB) is headquartered in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
2. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement primarily focuses on providing military support to member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NDB is headquartered in Shanghai, China, not Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.  The statement contains an error regarding the location of the NDB's headquarters.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides *financial*, not military, support to member nations facing balance of payment challenges. The statement misrepresents the nature of the support provided.


**20. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions primarily focus on regulating the conduct of warfare between states only, excluding non-state actors.
2. The 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions was celebrated in 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Geneva Conventions primarily address the conduct of warfare between states, they also apply to the treatment of individuals not participating in hostilities, and the text mentions that they are the cornerstone of International Humanitarian Law (IHL) which extends beyond state-to-state conflict. The statement oversimplifies the scope of the Geneva Conventions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that 2024 marks the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, not 2023. The statement is incorrect regarding the anniversary year.


**1. With reference to India's engagement with the Global South, consider the following statements:**

1. The Social Impact Fund, a $25 million initiative, aims to bolster digital infrastructure in select nations of the Global South.
2. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum primarily focuses on promoting tourism and cultural exchange programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's Social Impact Fund is a significant initiative dedicated to accelerating the adoption and implementation of Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in developing countries within the Global South. The $25 million commitment underscores India's commitment to bridging the digital divide and fostering digital empowerment.  This aligns with India's broader strategy of South-South cooperation and its role as a responsible global power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum is primarily designed for education and capacity building among young diplomats from Global South nations. While cultural exchange might be a component, the core objective is focused on enhancing diplomatic skills, fostering international understanding, and preparing future leaders in international relations.  The focus is on strengthening diplomatic ties and promoting collaborative initiatives.  Tourism is not a primary focus.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI):**

1. IPOI is a treaty-based arrangement, mandating specific contributions from participating nations.
2. The initiative's philosophy is rooted in India's SAGAR initiative, emphasizing inclusive development and maritime security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IPOI is explicitly described as a *non-treaty-based* voluntary arrangement.  This means participation is based on willing cooperation, without legally binding obligations.  The flexible nature of the initiative allows for diverse levels of engagement from participating nations.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPOI's core philosophy directly builds upon India's SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative. SAGAR prioritizes inclusive development, balancing economic assistance with maritime security concerns, all within the framework of international maritime laws and norms.  The IPOI extends this vision to a broader Indo-Pacific context.


**3. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  TEPA establishes a customs union, similar to the European Union, harmonizing external tariffs among member states.
2.  The agreement includes provisions for Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) in professional services, aiming to facilitate cross-border mobility of professionals.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The TEPA explicitly states that EFTA is *not* a customs union.  Unlike the EU, EFTA member countries retain their own external tariffs for countries outside the association. This reflects the differing structures and objectives of these two economic blocs.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key feature of the TEPA is the inclusion of provisions for MRAs in professional services. These agreements aim to streamline the process for professionals like nurses and architects to work across borders, enhancing collaboration and economic integration between India and EFTA members.


**4. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India currently holds a significant trade deficit with the United States.
2. The INDUS-X initiative primarily focuses on cooperation in renewable energy technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly indicates that India has a *trade surplus* with the US, not a deficit. This highlights the significant export-oriented nature of India's trade relationship with the United States.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The INDUS-X initiative, launched under the Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) framework, focuses on fostering partnerships between U.S. and Indian defense companies, incubators, accelerators, investors, and universities.  Its primary focus is on defense industrial cooperation, not renewable energy.


**5. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2009 with the primary objective of eliminating all trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2. India currently enjoys a trade surplus with the ASEAN bloc.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties, it doesn't eliminate *all* trade barriers.  The agreement involves a phased approach to tariff reduction and other trade liberalization measures, not an immediate and complete removal of all barriers.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, meaning imports from ASEAN countries exceed India's exports to the region.  This imbalance highlights the need for further trade liberalization and diversification within the framework of AITIGA.


**6. With reference to the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA), consider the following statements:**

1. A CSA involves a one-time exchange of currencies at a predetermined rate with no future obligations.
2. India's BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is an example of a bilateral CSA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. A CSA involves an agreement to exchange currencies at a set rate, with a *future* re-exchange at an agreed-upon rate. This aspect of future obligations distinguishes it from a simple one-time currency transaction.  The mechanism allows for managing exchange rate risks and facilitating cross-border transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is a *multilateral* agreement among BRICS nations, not a bilateral CSA.  While it involves currency arrangements, its scope and structure differ significantly from a standard bilateral CSA between two countries.


**7. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chabahar Port is located on the Arabian Sea, offering a direct sea route to Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.
2. The development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar is solely a bilateral agreement between India and Iran.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Chabahar Port is strategically located on the Gulf of Oman (part of the Arabian Sea), providing a crucial alternative sea route to Central Asia, bypassing the need to transit through Pakistan.  This significantly reduces transit time and enhances connectivity for landlocked countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The initial development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port involved a *tripartite* agreement between India, Iran, and Afghanistan. This highlights the broader geopolitical significance of the project and its role in regional connectivity.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. INSTC is a 7,200 km long multi-modal transportation network established in 2000 connecting India, Iran, and Russia.
2.  INSTC primarily aims to reduce reliance on the Suez Canal for trade between India and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INSTC is a multi-modal transportation network spanning approximately 7,200 km, established in 2000 through an agreement between India, Iran, and Russia.  This network facilitates trade and connectivity among multiple countries.

Statement 2 is correct. A key objective of the INSTC is to provide an alternative route to the Suez Canal for trade between India and Europe. By utilizing land and sea routes through Iran and Central Asia, it aims to reduce transit times and costs, enhancing efficiency and competitiveness.  This reduces reliance on a single, potentially vulnerable, maritime route.


**9. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India and the Middle East, excluding Europe.
2. The IMEC is envisioned as a key component of global connectivity initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC, as its name suggests, aims to strengthen economic connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It is a multi-regional initiative designed to foster trade, investment, and infrastructure development across these interconnected regions.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the IMEC is considered a cornerstone of global connectivity.  This signifies its importance in the broader context of international trade, infrastructure development, and economic integration.  It is viewed as a strategic initiative to promote seamless connectivity.


**10. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus recently became the ninth member of the SCO.
2. The SCO's primary focus is on fostering economic cooperation among its member states, excluding security concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text indicates that Belarus became the *tenth* member of the SCO, not the ninth.  This expansion reflects the growing influence and reach of the organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While economic cooperation is a significant aspect of the SCO's agenda, security concerns are also central to its mandate.  The organization addresses issues such as terrorism, separatism, and extremism, reflecting its broader security focus alongside economic goals.  The cooperation programs explicitly mention counter-terrorism efforts.



**1. With reference to multilateral peace operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023, the largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces was in the Middle East, reflecting escalating conflicts in the region.
2.  Brazil was the highest contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, surpassing traditional contributors like India and Ethiopia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East. This highlights the ongoing need for peacekeeping efforts in that region.  The statement attempts to mislead by suggesting a different, plausible but incorrect, location for the highest concentration of UN peacekeepers.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text clearly indicates that India was the highest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.  The option presents Brazil as the highest contributor, a deliberate attempt to create confusion among candidates familiar with other significant contributors to UN peacekeeping.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall in UPSC-style questions.  The distractor is effective because Brazil is also a significant player on the international stage and has participated in peacekeeping missions.


**2. With reference to India's military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and the United Kingdom, focusing primarily on counter-terrorism operations.
2. Exercise Varuna, the 2024 edition, was a bilateral naval exercise conducted in the South China Sea, aimed at enhancing maritime security cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and France, not the United Kingdom. The focus isn't solely on counter-terrorism; it encompasses a broader range of military cooperation aspects. The question uses the similar-sounding "Shakti" to confuse candidates familiar with various India-UK defense collaborations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Exercise Varuna is indeed a bilateral naval exercise between India and France, the 2024 edition took place in the Mediterranean Sea, not the South China Sea. The South China Sea is a strategically sensitive region, making this a plausible but incorrect distractor. This emphasizes the need for accurate recall of geographical details.


**3. With reference to the Golden Crescent region, consider the following statements:**

1. The Golden Crescent, now renamed the Death Crescent, comprises Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Myanmar.
2.  Cannabis is legal for recreational use in all member states of the European Union.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Golden Crescent (Death Crescent) includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, not Myanmar. The inclusion of Myanmar is a deliberate attempt to confuse candidates familiar with the drug trade in Southeast Asia. The geographical inaccuracy serves as a potent distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While cannabis legalization is progressing in various parts of the world, including some jurisdictions within the EU, it's not legal for recreational use in *all* member states.  The statement presents a sweeping generalization to test whether candidates understand the complexities of drug policy across different countries.  The all-encompassing nature of the statement makes it an easily identifiable false statement.


**4. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

1.  UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention, was adopted in 2005 and has not been ratified by India.
2.  The UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, is a separate treaty unrelated to UNTOC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. UNTOC (Palermo Convention) was adopted in 2000, not 2005, and the text clearly states that it *has* been ratified by India. The alteration of the year and the status of ratification creates a strong distractor. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the treaty's history and India's participation in international conventions.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, is explicitly mentioned as a *supplement* to UNTOC, indicating a clear relationship between the two treaties. The claim that they are unrelated is a misleading statement designed to test the candidate's understanding of the interconnectedness of international legal frameworks.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported fewer than 100 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023.
2.  Atoms4NetZero is an IAEA program focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions by promoting renewable energy sources like solar and wind.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the IAEA's ITDB reported 168 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023, significantly more than the figure presented in the statement.  This aims to test the candidate's ability to recall precise numerical data.  The lower number is a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While Atoms4NetZero aims to help achieve net-zero emissions, it does so by promoting *nuclear* energy, not renewable sources.  The replacement of "nuclear energy" with "renewable energy sources" is a subtle but effective way to create a misleading statement.  This highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of specific IAEA programs.


**6. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in CMF predates 2022.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by any nation under the CMF umbrella.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that India joined the CMF in 2022, making this statement false.  The inaccuracy in the timeline serves as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed the first such operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF, it was not the first drug seizure operation conducted under the CMF overall. Other nations within the CMF would have conducted similar operations prior to India's involvement. The question attempts to mislead candidates by focusing on India's specific role rather than the broader context of CMF operations.


**7.  With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2023, marking a significant step towards greater regional cooperation.
2.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity focuses solely on road infrastructure development, neglecting other modes of transportation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in May 2024, not 2023.  The slight alteration in the year is a common technique used in UPSC-style questions to create a plausible but incorrect statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity addresses a broader range of transportation needs, not just road infrastructure.  The limitation to just road infrastructure is a misleading statement designed to test the candidate's understanding of the plan's scope.  It aims to see if candidates understand that the plan is holistic in its approach to regional connectivity.


**8. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was primarily driven by concerns about India's economic influence in the region.
2. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is funded entirely by the Maldivian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign was largely fueled by concerns about India's *military* presence and perceived interference in Maldivian domestic affairs, not solely economic influence. The emphasis on economic concerns is a misleading detail.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure project being developed *with substantial Indian assistance*, meaning it is not solely funded by the Maldivian government.  The statement tries to mislead the candidate by suggesting a different funding source for the project.  The funding source is a key detail, testing factual knowledge.


**9. With reference to geographical locations, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is located in northern Kenya and southern Sudan.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro is the second-highest mountain in Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lake Turkana is situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, not southern Sudan.  The inclusion of Sudan is a geographical inaccuracy designed to create a plausible but incorrect answer.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of African geography.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa, not the second highest. The statement attempts to mislead candidates by providing a similar-sounding but incorrect ranking for the mountain.  This tests the candidate's ability to recall superlative facts.


**10. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.
2.  India's recent shift in fuel exports to Europe utilizes the Cape of Good Hope route as a direct alternative to the Suez Canal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  The substitution of oceans is a geographical inaccuracy designed to test the candidate's knowledge of major waterways.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India has shifted some fuel exports to utilize the Cape of Good Hope route, it's not a *direct* alternative.  The Cape route is significantly longer, adding to transport time and cost.  The description of the route as a direct alternative is a misleading simplification.  This tests the candidate's understanding of global trade routes.


**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1992 and enforced in 1997, mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapon stockpiles by member states within a predetermined timeframe, irrespective of their initial quantity.
2.  The CWC's verification mechanism solely relies on self-reporting by member states, supplemented by occasional, unscheduled inspections of declared facilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC does mandate the destruction of all chemical weapon stockpiles, the timeframe for destruction isn't necessarily "irrespective" of the initial quantity.  Larger stockpiles naturally require more time and resources for safe and verified destruction. The convention provides a framework for phased destruction, taking into account the specific circumstances of each member state.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC's verification mechanism is far more robust than mere self-reporting and occasional inspections. It involves a complex system of declarations, on-site inspections (both announced and unannounced),  challenge inspections (if there's suspicion of non-compliance), and continuous monitoring of declared facilities.  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) plays a crucial role in this verification process, providing independent oversight and ensuring compliance.  The system aims to prevent clandestine production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.


**2. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's MER, first adopted in 2010, assesses the country's efforts solely in combating money laundering, excluding terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. The FATF's MER process involves a peer review by FATF members, utilizing a standardized evaluation methodology to ensure consistency and objectivity across all participating countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's MER, and indeed all MERs conducted by the FATF, comprehensively assess a country's measures to combat not only money laundering but also terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These three areas are integral components of the FATF's overall objective to counter illicit financial flows that can fund terrorism and other threats to international security.

Statement 2 is correct. The FATF's MER process is indeed a peer review conducted by its member states.  A standardized methodology ensures consistency and objectivity, allowing for fair and comparable assessments across different countries. This rigorous process involves detailed reviews of legislation, institutions, and enforcement mechanisms, as well as on-site visits to verify information provided.


**3. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day Report for 2024 identified cocaine as the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade in Africa, neglecting other regions significantly affected by this criminal activity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day Report consistently highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally.  While the report details the prevalence of other drugs like opioids, cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy, their usage doesn't surpass that of cannabis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, covering various regions and continents affected by illegal wildlife trade. While specific regions might receive greater attention depending on the severity and nature of the threats, the report doesn't focus exclusively on Africa.  It aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global wildlife crime landscape and the challenges involved in combating it.


**4. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its programs, consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to the theft or illicit trafficking of nuclear weapons, excluding other forms of nuclear material.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses solely on promoting the use of nuclear fusion energy to achieve net-zero emissions, excluding other nuclear technologies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB monitors and reports on a broader range of incidents involving nuclear and other radioactive materials, not just nuclear weapons. It includes incidents related to theft, loss, smuggling, and other forms of illicit trafficking of various types of nuclear materials, which could be used for malicious purposes, including the creation of improvised nuclear devices.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program promotes nuclear energy to help achieve net-zero emissions, it encompasses both fission and fusion technologies.  The program recognizes the potential role of both in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and achieving climate goals.  It's not limited solely to promoting nuclear fusion.


**5. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's GCI 2024 categorized India among the "developing" countries (Tier 3 or 4), indicating a moderate level of commitment to cybersecurity.
2. The GCI assessment framework uses a single, overarching metric to evaluate a country's cybersecurity capabilities, simplifying cross-country comparisons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ITU's GCI 2024 actually placed India among the "role model" countries (Tier 1), demonstrating a strong commitment across all five cybersecurity pillars. This highlights India's significant investments and initiatives in strengthening its cybersecurity infrastructure and capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCI uses a multi-faceted assessment framework, evaluating countries across multiple dimensions and cybersecurity pillars.  This comprehensive approach ensures a more nuanced and accurate assessment of a country's overall cybersecurity posture, compared to a single metric.  The five pillars generally considered include legal measures, technical measures, organizational measures, capacity building, and cooperation.


**6. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) and Operation Crimson Barracuda, consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under the CMF, involved the seizure of a significant quantity of narcotics in the Indian Ocean.
2.  India's participation in the CMF is limited to intelligence sharing, with no direct involvement in maritime security operations conducted by the CMF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF in 2022, resulting in a drug seizure in the Arabian Sea (a part of the Indian Ocean).  The exact quantity seized might vary in reports, but the core fact of the operation and seizure remains true.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's participation in the CMF involves more than just intelligence sharing; it includes active participation in maritime security operations, as demonstrated by Operation Crimson Barracuda.  This reflects India's commitment to enhancing regional maritime security and its growing role in multinational maritime collaborations.


**7. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, including the power to arrest and detain individuals without trial, but only for offenses relating to terrorism and insurgency.
2.  The extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh is a permanent measure, not subject to review or periodic renewal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, including powers of arrest and detention without trial. However, the scope of these powers extends beyond just terrorism and insurgency; it covers a broader range of offenses deemed necessary for maintaining public order and security in those areas.  The exact scope is subject to interpretation and legal challenges.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The extension of AFSPA is not permanent; it's a temporary measure that requires periodic review and renewal by the government.  This reflects the controversial nature of the act and the ongoing debate surrounding its impact on human rights and civil liberties.  The government periodically reviews the necessity of the act's application in specific areas.


**8. With reference to India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India maintains strategic partnerships with all six member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), demonstrating a high level of engagement across the region.
2.  India's remittances from GCC countries consistently account for over 50% of India’s total remittances annually.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India has strong and strategic partnerships with some GCC members (like Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Oman), it doesn't maintain such partnerships with *all* six member states to the same degree. The level of engagement and strategic cooperation varies depending on bilateral relations and specific geopolitical considerations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While remittances from GCC countries are significant for India, they don't consistently account for more than 50% of India's total annual remittances.  The exact percentage fluctuates yearly, depending on various economic factors and global trends.  The figure mentioned in the source material (30% in 2020-21) is a more accurate representation.


**9. With reference to NATO and its related terms, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ukraine is currently a full member of NATO, enjoying the full range of collective security guarantees provided by the alliance.
2.  The Major Non-NATO Ally (MNNA) status grants foreign partners access to all US defense technologies and security cooperation benefits.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Ukraine is *not* currently a full member of NATO.  It has applied for membership, but its accession is subject to various political and security considerations.  While NATO has provided significant support to Ukraine, it hasn't yet become a full member with all the associated rights and security guarantees.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The MNNA status does provide certain benefits in defense trade and security cooperation, but it doesn't grant access to *all* US defense technologies.  The specific benefits are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and are subject to various restrictions and limitations.  The level of access to specific technologies is always contingent upon multiple factors, including national security interests.


**10. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions primarily address the protection of civilians during armed conflicts, excluding the treatment of prisoners of war and wounded combatants.
2.  The Geneva Conventions are legally binding on all states, irrespective of whether they have formally ratified the conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are a set of four treaties that establish international legal standards for humanitarian treatment during wartime.  They comprehensively address the protection of civilians, prisoners of war (POWs), and wounded or sick combatants (both military and civilian).  Each convention specifically deals with a different aspect of humanitarian treatment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions are legally binding only on states that have formally ratified them.  While the conventions are widely considered part of customary international law (meaning many of their provisions are accepted as binding even by non-signatories), formal ratification is necessary for full legal bindingness.  States that haven't ratified the conventions are not fully legally bound by their provisions.


**11. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) and its Supply Chain Council, consider the following statements:**

1. India's role as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council is a permanent position, ensuring continuous Indian leadership in supply chain initiatives.
2. The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement establishes a centralized, unified body to manage all aspects of supply chain resilience, crisis response, and labor rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India was elected Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council, this is not a permanent position.  The leadership roles within IPEF bodies are typically subject to rotation or re-election, reflecting the framework's inclusive and collaborative nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement establishes *three* distinct bodies—the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board—to address different facets of supply chain resilience and associated challenges. This decentralized approach allows for focused efforts in each area, rather than a single, potentially overburdened body.


**12. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade and investment flows between India and European Union countries, excluding the Middle East.
2.  The IMEC is fully funded by the Indian government, demonstrating India's commitment to driving regional connectivity initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC, as its name suggests, aims to enhance connectivity and economic cooperation among India, Middle Eastern countries, and Europe.  It's not solely focused on India-EU relations but seeks to create a broader, multi-regional economic corridor.  The inclusion of the Middle East is crucial to its overall vision.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMEC is not solely funded by the Indian government.  It's envisioned as a collaborative initiative involving multiple stakeholders from India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Funding will likely come from a mix of public and private sources, reflecting the collaborative nature of the project.


**13. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus's accession to the SCO makes it the eleventh member state, significantly expanding the organization's geographical reach.
2.  The SCO's focus on counter-terrorism and regional security has led it to consistently prioritize military cooperation over economic and cultural exchanges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus's accession to the SCO makes it the tenth member state, not the eleventh.  While this does expand the organization's reach, the number of members is ten, not eleven.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While counter-terrorism and regional security are important aspects of the SCO's agenda, it also prioritizes economic and cultural cooperation among its member states.  The organization has various initiatives focused on promoting trade, investment, and cultural exchanges, reflecting a broader approach to regional integration beyond security concerns.


**14. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7) and its initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 exclusively for infrastructure projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.
2. The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses solely on supporting renewable energy projects, excluding fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The G7's PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects in developing countries, not exclusively in Sub-Saharan Africa.  The initiative has a broader geographical scope, encompassing various regions and countries based on their development needs and priorities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while prioritizing renewable energy, doesn't exclude fossil fuel-based energy infrastructure entirely.  The initiative recognizes the need for a diversified energy mix in Africa, taking into account the existing energy infrastructure and the specific circumstances of each country.  The focus is on accelerating the transition to cleaner energy while ensuring energy security and access.


**15. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and the US State Sponsors of Terrorism list, consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US State Sponsors of Terrorism list reflects its consistent opposition to all forms of unilateral sanctions imposed by any country.
2.  The US State Sponsors of Terrorism list includes only countries that have directly participated in acts of international terrorism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is an oversimplification. While NAM's call for Cuba's removal reflects its opposition to unilateral sanctions, it's not a blanket opposition to *all* such sanctions.  NAM's position is more nuanced, focusing on the perceived injustice and disproportionate impact of sanctions on specific countries.  The organization's stance depends on the context and the specific circumstances involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The US State Sponsors of Terrorism list includes countries that the US government alleges to have provided support for international terrorism, even if that support is indirect or through proxies.  Direct participation is not the sole criterion for inclusion on the list.  The accusations and the criteria used are often subject to debate and criticism.


**16. With reference to India's relations with the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth, reflecting its significant economic strength and commitment to the organization.
2. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is limited to providing development assistance to Commonwealth countries in Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant member of the Commonwealth and has a large population, it is not the largest financial contributor.  Its contribution is substantial, but other countries might contribute more financially.  The ranking of financial contributions can fluctuate based on various factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is not limited to African Commonwealth countries.  It provides development assistance to eligible Commonwealth countries across various regions and continents, based on their development needs and priorities.  The allocation of funds is not geographically restricted.


**17. With reference to India-US relations and defense agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) allows for reciprocal access to military bases and facilities between India and the US, including the unrestricted use of each other's airfields and ports.
2. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been applied to India, reflecting a strong and consistent US commitment to exempting India from all sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While LEMOA does facilitate logistics support and reciprocal access to military facilities, it doesn't allow for *unrestricted* use.  The access is governed by specific agreements and procedures, ensuring that both countries' security interests are protected.  There are limitations and provisions for the use of each other's assets.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the US Congress passed an amendment to exempt India from CAATSA sanctions for purchasing the S-400 missile defense system, the US State Department has issued warnings regarding potential sanctions under CAATSA in other contexts.  This shows that while there is a degree of exemption, it is not a blanket, unconditional commitment to completely exempt India from all potential sanctions under CAATSA.  The US approach is context-dependent.


**18. With reference to the US and its geographical features, consider the following statements:**

1. The Mississippi River is the world's longest river, surpassing all other rivers in terms of total length.
2. The Appalachian Mountains are the only significant mountain range in the eastern US, excluding all other smaller ranges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Mississippi River is a major river in the US, but it is not the world's longest river.  Other rivers, such as the Amazon River and the Nile River, are significantly longer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Appalachian Mountains are a significant range in the eastern US, there are other mountain ranges in the east, although they may be smaller or less extensive than the Appalachians.  The eastern US has a diverse geography, including various smaller mountain ranges and hill systems.


**19. With reference to India-UK relations and areas of cooperation, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh reflects the government's assessment of the prevailing security situation in these regions.
2. The AFSPA grants sweeping powers to the armed forces, including the authority to arrest and detain individuals without due process, and this has been consistently praised by human rights organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The extension of AFSPA to certain areas of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh is a decision taken by the government based on its assessment of the security situation in those regions.  Such decisions are often made considering factors such as ongoing insurgency, cross-border threats, or internal security concerns.  The government's rationale is usually based on maintaining law and order and protecting national security.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AFSPA, while granting extensive powers to the armed forces, has been a subject of considerable criticism from human rights organizations.  Concerns have been raised regarding the potential for misuse of these powers, leading to human rights violations.  The Act's provisions related to arrest and detention without due process have been particularly contentious, leading to widespread debate and calls for reform or repeal.  Therefore, characterizing the Act as consistently praised by human rights organizations is fundamentally inaccurate.


**8. With reference to the Kargil War and Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar, undertaken by the Indian Air Force, played a decisive role in neutralizing Pakistani troops stationed at high-altitude positions.
2. Operation Talwar, launched by the Indian Navy, involved a complete naval blockade of Pakistan, significantly restricting its maritime activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Operation Safed Sagar, conducted by the Indian Air Force during Operation Vijay, played a significant role in targeting Pakistani positions in the Kargil conflict.  While it didn't completely neutralize all Pakistani troops, its air strikes disrupted their supply lines and inflicted considerable damage, contributing to India's eventual success.  The operation's impact was substantial, though the claim of complete neutralization might be an overstatement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Talwar, while aiming to restrict Pakistani naval movements, did not constitute a complete naval blockade.  The Indian Navy's actions focused more on maintaining a strong naval presence and deterring any potential Pakistani naval actions, rather than a full-scale blockade.  A complete blockade would have involved a much more comprehensive and encompassing naval strategy, which was not the case during Operation Talwar.


**9. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the deployment of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in outer space, but it does not explicitly address the deployment of conventional weapons.
2.  Militarization of space refers solely to the deployment of weapons in space, excluding the use of space-based assets to support military operations on Earth.

2. India's MER, first adopted in 2010, has consistently received a "compliant" rating from the FATF, indicating its strong anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER is a comprehensive evaluation of a country's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The assessment takes into account various aspects, including the legal framework, institutional capacity, implementation mechanisms, and international cooperation.  A thorough evaluation across these areas is crucial for determining a country's effectiveness in preventing and countering these financial crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, its rating has not consistently been "compliant."  The FATF's evaluation process involves periodic reviews, and India's performance has been subject to scrutiny and subsequent improvements over time.  Therefore, stating that India has consistently received a "compliant" rating is an inaccurate representation of the dynamic nature of the FATF's evaluation process.


**12. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses solely on the illegal wildlife trade in Africa, neglecting other regions of the world.

2.  The Geneva Conventions explicitly permit the use of certain weapons, such as landmines and cluster munitions, provided they are used in accordance with the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are cornerstones of International Humanitarian Law (IHL), providing a comprehensive framework for the protection of victims of armed conflict.  They establish fundamental principles, such as distinction between combatants and civilians, proportionality in attacks, and the prohibition of unnecessary suffering, aiming to limit the effects of armed conflict and protect those who are not or are no longer participating in hostilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions do not explicitly permit the use of specific weapons like landmines or cluster munitions.  While the conventions establish general principles for the conduct of warfare, the use of certain weapons has been subject to further international agreements and treaties, many of which prohibit or restrict their use due to their indiscriminate nature and potential for causing excessive harm to civilians.  Therefore, suggesting that the Geneva Conventions explicitly permit the use of these weapons is inaccurate.


**14. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, which came into force in 2024, enhances the organization's legal personality and strengthens its institutional framework.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter marked a significant milestone for the organization, providing it with a stronger legal foundation and enhancing its ability to function effectively.  The charter outlines the organization's goals, principles, structure, and operational mechanisms, strengthening its institutional framework and legal personality.  This enhances BIMSTEC's capacity to address regional challenges and promote cooperation among its member states.

Statement 1 is correct. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of command, control, and disciplinary processes within Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs).  This involves clarifying the chain of command and establishing clearer procedures for handling disciplinary matters.  The goal is to ensure better coordination and accountability within these joint service structures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Act grants significant authority to the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs, it does not grant them absolute and unchallengeable authority that overrides all existing laws and regulations.  The Act operates within the existing legal framework and is subject to judicial review and oversight.  Therefore, suggesting absolute and unchallengeable authority is an overstatement.


**18. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS plays a crucial role in coordinating national security policies across various government ministries and agencies.
2. The NSCS is directly responsible for the formulation and implementation of all national security policies, overriding the authority of individual ministries.

1. The ICC's jurisdiction extends to prosecuting individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, based on the Rome Statute.
2. The ICC has universal jurisdiction, meaning it can prosecute individuals from any country, regardless of whether their state is a party to the Rome Statute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 1 is correct. The ICC's mandate, as defined by the Rome Statute, is to prosecute individuals for the most serious international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  The court's jurisdiction is based on the principle of complementarity, meaning it intervenes when national jurisdictions are unwilling or unable to genuinely investigate and prosecute such crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ICC's jurisdiction is not universal in the sense that it can prosecute individuals from any country regardless of their state's status.  While the ICC can exercise jurisdiction over individuals from non-state parties under certain circumstances, its primary jurisdiction is based on the principle of state consent, meaning a state must be a party to the Rome Statute for the ICC to exercise jurisdiction over crimes committed within its territory or by its nationals.  Therefore, suggesting universal jurisdiction is an oversimplification of the court's complex jurisdictional framework.

2. The West Papua conflict in Indonesia involves the Indonesian government and the Free Papua Movement (OPM), primarily focused on resource exploitation and cultural suppression.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core issues of the conflicts described in the provided text. Statement 1 correctly identifies the key players (Thai government vs. Malay-Muslim separatists) and the underlying causes (ethnic and religious tensions, autonomy demands) in the Patani conflict in Southern Thailand. The conflict is rooted in historical grievances, cultural differences, and the desire for self-governance among the Malay-Muslim population.

Similarly, Statement 2 accurately describes the conflict in West Papua, Indonesia. It correctly identifies the Indonesian government's role and the Free Papua Movement (OPM)'s objectives, which are centered around independence aspirations, concerns over resource exploitation by the Indonesian government, and the suppression of Papuan culture and identity. The conflict highlights the complexities of managing resource extraction in a region with a distinct cultural identity and aspirations for self-determination.  Therefore, both statements are factually correct according to the provided information.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  While it has been a point of trade,  the statement inaccurately attributes its trade facilitation to India and Nepal directly; the situation is more complex given geopolitical realities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, not the Amarnath Yatra.  The Amarnath Yatra takes place in a completely different geographical location in the Himalayas.  Confusing the two pilgrimages is a key distractor.

Both statements are inaccurate, making (d) the correct option.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  While it facilitates trade between Europe and Asia,  the statement's assertion about its connection to North America is geographically inaccurate. The canal significantly shortens the maritime route between Europe and Asia.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Recent geopolitical events, such as the temporary blockage of the canal, have actually led to *disruptions* and *shifts* in trade routes, rather than an *increase* in the overall volume of goods transported through the Suez Canal.  The statement misinterprets the impact of such events.

Both statements contain factual errors, making (d) the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, including the powers mentioned.  This is a core element of the Act's provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AFSPA's application has not been consistent across India's northeastern region since 1958.  Its application has been subject to modifications, extensions, and reductions based on security assessments.  There have also been significant legal challenges to the Act. The statement fails to acknowledge the Act's evolving implementation and the controversies surrounding it.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, although not necessarily the largest in Asia.  The statement is largely accurate in reflecting the dominant position of both countries in each other's regional trade.

Statement 2 is correct. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant and the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline are examples of ongoing and completed collaborative projects between the two nations.  These are significant elements in the bilateral economic relationship.

Both statements are largely accurate, making (c) the correct answer.


**12. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank established by the G7 nations to provide financial assistance for infrastructure projects in developing countries.
2. The AIIB's lending operations primarily focus on providing grants to low-income countries for sustainable infrastructure development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIIB was not established by the G7 nations. It's a multilateral development bank established by a broader group of countries, including China and several other Asian nations.  The statement misrepresents the bank's founding members.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the AIIB does support sustainable infrastructure, its lending operations are primarily focused on loans, not grants.  Grants may be part of its operations, but they don't constitute the primary mode of financial assistance.  The statement misrepresents the bank's primary lending mechanism.

Both statements are inaccurate, making (d) the correct answer.


**13. With reference to the Arab League, consider the following statements:**

1. The Arab League Summit of 2024 was held in Saudi Arabia and focused primarily on economic cooperation among member states.
2. The Arab League comprises all the independent nation-states in the Arab world, with a strong emphasis on political unity among its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Saudi Arabia.  While economic cooperation is a part of the Arab League's agenda, the summit's focus may have encompassed other key issues as well. The statement misrepresents the location and the scope of the summit.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Arab League does not comprise *all* the independent nation-states in the Arab world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagorno-Karabakh region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, not Armenia.  While there is a significant Armenian population in the region, its internationally recognized status lies with Azerbaijan.  The statement misrepresents the region's internationally acknowledged status.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The recent conflicts have led to a partial withdrawal of Russian peacekeeping forces, not a complete withdrawal.  A power vacuum is not the only outcome; the situation is more nuanced and involves ongoing negotiations and power dynamics between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  The statement oversimplifies the complex post-conflict situation.

Both statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the correct answer.


**15. With reference to Ukraine, consider the following statements:**

1.  Ukraine shares land borders with Poland, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Moldova, Russia, and Belarus.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Nord Stream pipelines did transport natural gas from Russia to Germany, passing through the Baltic Sea.  This is a well-established fact about the pipelines' functionality and geographic route.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the damage to the Nord Stream pipelines caused initial price volatility, it did not result in a *significant and lasting* increase in natural gas prices in Europe.  Other factors, such as global supply and demand dynamics, significantly influenced gas prices. The statement oversimplifies the complex interplay of factors determining gas prices.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the right answer.


**17. With reference to the Kursk region, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kursk region is located in western Russia, bordering Ukraine and Belarus.
2. The declaration of an emergency in the Kursk region was primarily due to a major industrial accident at a chemical plant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The Kursk region is located in western Russia, bordering Ukraine.  The inclusion of Belarus is incorrect; it does not border Belarus.   The statement is mostly accurate geographically but needs minor correction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The reason for the emergency declaration in the Kursk region is not explicitly stated in the provided text. While an industrial accident is possible, the provided information doesn't confirm this as the primary cause.  The statement is speculative and unsupported by the available information.

Therefore, only a modified version of statement 1 is correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer despite its minor inaccuracy.


**18. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII is a G7-led initiative aimed at mobilizing private sector investment for infrastructure projects in developing countries.
2. The PGII's primary focus is on providing concessional loans to low-income countries for climate-resilient infrastructure projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PGII is indeed a G7-led initiative focused on mobilizing both public and private sector investments for infrastructure projects in developing countries.  This is a key aspect of the PGII's approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PGII does support climate-resilient infrastructure, its mechanism isn't solely focused on concessional loans to low-income countries.  It employs a broader range of financial instruments and targets a wider range of countries.  The statement oversimplifies the PGII's financial mechanisms and its target audience.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct option.


**19. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list reflects its consistent opposition to US foreign policy.
2. NAM comprises a diverse group of countries from across the Global South, with a shared commitment to non-alignment in international relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially true but overstates NAM's stance. While NAM has often voiced concerns about US foreign policy, its position isn't always one of consistent opposition.  NAM's approach is more nuanced, seeking to promote its own interests and principles within the international system. The statement simplifies NAM's complex relationship with the US.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  NAM does represent a diverse range of countries from the Global South, united by their commitment to non-alignment. This is a core principle defining the movement's identity and purpose.

Therefore, statement 2 is more accurate, making (b) the preferable answer.


**20. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the largest member state of the Commonwealth, contributing the most financially to its budget.
2.  The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, primarily focuses on promoting sustainable development goals in African nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is the largest member state of the Commonwealth in terms of population, it's not the largest financial contributor to the organization's budget.  Several other countries contribute significantly as well.  The statement misrepresents India's financial contribution to the Commonwealth.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, does focus on promoting sustainable development goals. While its geographical focus is not exclusively limited to African nations, a significant portion of its funding is directed towards projects in Africa.

Therefore, only statement 2 is largely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**21. With reference to the Philippines, consider the following statements:**

1. The Philippines is an archipelago located in Southeast Asia, bordering the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.
2. The Philippines has a predominantly mountainous terrain, with limited coastal plains and fertile agricultural land.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Philippines is indeed an archipelago in Southeast Asia, bordering the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea.  This is an accurate description of its geographical location and maritime boundaries.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the Philippines does have mountainous regions, it also possesses significant coastal plains and fertile agricultural lands. The statement oversimplifies the country's diverse topography and understates the extent of its arable land.

Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**22. With reference to Mauritius, consider the following statements:**

1. Mauritius is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean, east of Madagascar and south of the Seychelles.

Both statements are accurate, making (c) the correct answer.


**23. With reference to the Chagos Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chagos Islands are a group of islands in the Indian Ocean, claimed by both the UK and Mauritius.
2.  The ongoing dispute over the Chagos Islands primarily concerns the islands' strategic military importance for the UK and the US.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The sovereignty of the Chagos Islands is a subject of dispute between the UK and Mauritius, with Mauritius claiming the islands as its territory.  This is a key element of the ongoing dispute.

Statement 2 is correct. The dispute over the Chagos Islands does involve the islands' strategic military importance for both the UK and the US, given their location in the Indian Ocean.  This is a significant factor in the geopolitical dynamics surrounding the islands.

Both statements accurately reflect the situation regarding the Chagos Islands, making (c) the correct answer.


**24. With reference to Rwanda, consider the following statements:**

1. Rwanda is a landlocked country in East Africa, bordering Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Togo's location and bordering countries are accurately described.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While economic cooperation is likely part of India-Togo relations, the specific focus on the agricultural sector is not explicitly confirmed by the provided information.  The statement is speculative and lacks sufficient evidence.

Therefore, only statement 1 is confirmed, making (a) the correct answer.


**26. With reference to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The DRC is the largest country in Africa, with a diverse geography ranging from dense rainforests to vast savannas.
2.  The first secretary-level meeting between the defence ministries of India and the DRC signifies a new phase of military cooperation between the two countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The DRC is indeed the largest country in Africa, with a diverse geography.  However, the description might be an oversimplification, as the DRC's geography is more complex than simply "dense rainforests to vast savannas."  There are other significant geographical features as well.

Statement 2 is speculative. While the meeting indicates engagement between the two countries' defence ministries, it doesn't necessarily signify a "new phase of military cooperation."  Further details would be needed to confirm the extent and nature of any such cooperation.  The statement draws a premature conclusion.

Therefore, only statement 1, with a caveat regarding the simplification of its description, is more likely to be accurate, making (a) the preferable answer.


**27. With reference to the Southern Thailand (Patani) conflict, consider the following statements:**

1. The conflict in Southern Thailand is primarily between the Thai government and Malay-Muslim separatist groups seeking greater autonomy.
2. The conflict's root causes are solely based on religious differences between the Buddhist majority and the Muslim minority populations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The conflict in Southern Thailand is accurately characterized as a struggle between the Thai government and Malay-Muslim separatist groups advocating for greater autonomy or independence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The conflict's root causes are more complex than simply religious differences.  Historical grievances, socio-economic inequalities, and political marginalization of the Malay-Muslim population also play significant roles.  The statement oversimplifies the multifaceted nature of the conflict.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct, making (a) the correct answer.


**28. With reference to the West Papua conflict, consider the following statements:**

1. The West Papua conflict involves armed struggle between Indonesian security forces and Papuan independence movements.
2.  International attention to the West Papua conflict has been minimal, with limited international pressure on Indonesia to address human rights concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The West Papua conflict is characterized by armed resistance from Papuan independence groups against Indonesian security forces.  This accurately reflects the nature of the conflict.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While international attention to the West Papua conflict may not be as high as some other conflicts, there has been increasing international pressure on Indonesia to address human rights concerns in the region. Various international organizations and advocacy groups have been actively involved.  The statement understates the level of international scrutiny.

Therefore, only statement 1 is fully accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**29. With reference to the Gulf of Aden, consider the following statements:**

1. The Gulf of Aden is located between the Arabian Peninsula and the Horn of Africa, serving as a crucial shipping lane for global trade.
2. The increase in piracy activities in the Gulf of Aden has significantly impacted global shipping costs and insurance premiums.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Gulf of Aden's geographical location and its importance as a major shipping route are accurate.

Statement 2 is partially correct. While piracy in the Gulf of Aden has historically been a concern, its impact on global shipping costs and insurance premiums has fluctuated over time.  The statement's assertion of a *significant* and *ongoing* impact might be an overstatement.  Counter-piracy efforts have reduced the frequency of attacks.

Therefore, statement 1 is more consistently accurate, making (a) the better answer.


**30. With reference to Abu Musa Island, consider the following statements:**

1. Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the United Arab Emirates, with Iran maintaining de facto control.
2.  The dispute over Abu Musa Island is primarily driven by the island's rich oil and gas reserves.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The sovereignty of Abu Musa Island is disputed between Iran and the UAE, with Iran maintaining effective control.  This is a well-established fact.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the island's strategic location is a major factor in the dispute, the primary driver isn't necessarily its oil and gas reserves.  The territorial claim itself, and its geopolitical implications, are more prominent aspects of the conflict.  The statement misidentifies the dominant cause of the dispute.

Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate, making (a) the correct answer.


**31. With reference to the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are located in the East China Sea, claimed by both Japan and China, and are also claimed by Taiwan.
2. The dispute over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands is primarily driven by the islands' potential for military use and their rich fishing grounds.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands' location and the competing claims by Japan, China, and Taiwan are accurately described.

Statement 2 is correct. The dispute is significantly influenced by the islands' potential for military use and their importance as rich fishing grounds.  These are key factors contributing to the ongoing tension.

Both statements are accurate, making (c) the correct answer.


**32. With reference to Israel and the Erez crossing, consider the following statements:**

1. The Erez crossing is a border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip, primarily used for the movement of goods and humanitarian aid.
2.  Israel's recent decision to reopen the Erez crossing is intended to facilitate the free flow of all types of goods and individuals between Israel and Gaza.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The E

**1. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft within member states.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses solely on promoting the use of nuclear energy for electricity generation to achieve net-zero emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IAEA's ITDB does track incidents of nuclear material theft, it's not limited to only member states.  The database aims to monitor illicit trafficking globally, encompassing incidents regardless of the origin or destination's membership status in the IAEA.  The focus is on the illicit nature of the activity, not solely the nationality involved.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Atoms4NetZero, while heavily focused on nuclear energy's role in reducing emissions, isn't solely concerned with electricity generation.  The program encompasses broader applications of nuclear technology in various sectors to achieve net-zero goals. This includes areas like hydrogen production, industrial heat, and carbon capture, extending beyond just power production.  The program seeks to explore the entire spectrum of nuclear energy's potential in decarbonization.

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses only the technical capabilities of nation-states in cybersecurity.
2.  India's inclusion in Tier 1 of the GCI 2024 signifies its commitment to only the technical aspects of cybersecurity infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITU's GCI 2024 is a holistic assessment. It goes beyond technical capabilities, encompassing five pillars: legal measures, technical measures, organizational measures, capacity building, and cooperation.  A country's ranking isn't determined solely by its technological prowess but by its overall commitment across these five areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's Tier 1 ranking reflects a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, not just technical aspects.  It demonstrates a strong commitment to all five pillars of the GCI framework, indicating a robust legal framework, effective organizational structures, substantial capacity building initiatives, and active international cooperation, alongside advanced technological capabilities.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) focuses solely on a country's legislative frameworks for combating money laundering.
2. India's MER, first adopted in 2010, has never undergone any subsequent revisions or updates.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER is a comprehensive evaluation. While legislative frameworks are a crucial component, the assessment extends to a country's practical implementation of measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  It examines institutions, enforcement actions, and international cooperation mechanisms, not just laws on paper.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India's MER was first adopted in 2010,  it's inaccurate to say it hasn't been revised.  The FATF conducts regular reviews and updates of member countries' compliance with its standards.  Therefore, India's MER has certainly undergone revisions and updates since its initial adoption in 2010 to reflect changes in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing strategies and effectiveness.


**4. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report focuses exclusively on the global production and trafficking of illicit drugs.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 solely examines the illegal trade in endangered species.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report encompasses a broader analysis than just production and trafficking.  It delves into patterns of drug abuse, the impact on public health, and the social and economic consequences of drug use, alongside the supply chain aspects.  It provides a comprehensive overview of the drug problem.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, while focusing on illegal wildlife trade, doesn't exclusively cover endangered species.  It examines the trade of a wide range of flora and fauna, encompassing species that may not be officially classified as endangered but are still subject to illegal trade due to their commercial value or other factors.  The report aims for a broader perspective on the illegal wildlife trade.


**5. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd Session focused solely on addressing cybercrime and data breaches.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative exclusively targets young offenders involved in violent crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The CCPCJ's 33rd Session addressed a wider range of issues than just cybercrime.  While cybercrime is a growing concern, the session's agenda included tackling transnational organized crime (TOC) in its various forms, encompassing various criminal activities.  The focus was on a broader approach to crime prevention and criminal justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GenJust initiative, while engaging youth, doesn't solely target young offenders involved in violent crimes.  It aims to involve young people more broadly in crime prevention and criminal justice initiatives, promoting their participation in building safer and more just communities.  The initiative has a preventative focus, going beyond just dealing with those who have already committed offenses.


**6. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. GlobE's primary focus is on assisting developing countries in establishing robust anti-corruption institutions.
2. India's election to GlobE's steering committee guarantees automatic access to all of GlobE's resources and funding.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GlobE supports international cooperation in combating corruption, its focus isn't exclusively on assisting developing countries in establishing institutions.  It promotes a global network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities, facilitating information sharing, capacity building, and joint operational activities among its members, regardless of their development status.  The network's scope is wider than just institutional development.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Election to GlobE's steering committee grants India a significant voice in the network's direction and priorities.  However, it doesn't automatically guarantee access to all resources or funding.  Resource allocation and funding are subject to various factors, including project proposals, available funding, and alignment with GlobE's overall strategic objectives.  Membership doesn't equate to unconditional access to all resources.


**7. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1. CAATSA mandates automatic sanctions against any country engaging in significant transactions with Russia.
2. The 2018 amendment exempting India from CAATSA sanctions applies to all future defense acquisitions from Russia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CAATSA doesn't automatically impose sanctions on every country dealing with Russia.  The Act allows for waivers and exemptions based on national security interests and other considerations.  The imposition of sanctions is a discretionary decision, not an automatic consequence of any transaction with Russia.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The 2018 amendment providing an exemption for India regarding the S-400 missile defense system purchase was specific to that particular transaction.  It didn't create a blanket exemption for all future defense acquisitions from Russia.  Each future acquisition would be subject to individual assessment under CAATSA, with the possibility of sanctions if deemed to violate the act's provisions.  The exemption was not permanent or all-encompassing.

This pipeline is a crucial element of energy cooperation between the two countries, facilitating the supply of refined petroleum products.  It does not transport crude oil.


**11. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is entirely funded by the Maldivian government.
2.  The currency swap agreement between India and Maldives is designed to permanently fix the exchange rate between the two currencies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure project in the Maldives, but it involves substantial financial and technical assistance from India.  It’s not solely funded by the Maldivian government.  India's contribution is a substantial part of the project's funding.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  A currency swap agreement is a tool for managing short-term exchange rate fluctuations and enhancing liquidity.  It doesn't aim to permanently fix the exchange rate.  The exchange rate between the two currencies will continue to be subject to market forces, despite the existence of the swap agreement.  The agreement is a temporary measure to manage liquidity.


**12. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon border between India and China.
2.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the only major border clash between India and China since 1962.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SCO's focus is broader than just military alliances.  While security cooperation is a component, the organization emphasizes economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and combating terrorism and extremism.  It's a multifaceted organization, not solely focused on military affairs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belarus's accession does expand the SCO's reach, but it's inaccurate to say it significantly extends into Western Europe.  Belarus is geographically located in Eastern Europe, and its inclusion primarily strengthens the SCO's presence in that region.  The SCO's reach is primarily in Central Asia and parts of Eastern Europe.


**14. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The G4 nations—Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan—are a group of countries that have been advocating for permanent seats on the UN Security Council for many years.  Their argument centers on the need for a more representative and effective council that better reflects the current geopolitical landscape.  They believe their inclusion would enhance the council's legitimacy and decision-making capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, also known as the Coffee Club, is a coalition of nations that *opposes* the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council seats.  Their primary concern is that expanding the permanent membership would further entrench the power of major states and potentially undermine the principle of equitable representation among all UN member states.  They propose alternative reforms to enhance the council's effectiveness without granting permanent seats to the G4.  The UfC's opposition highlights the complexities and ongoing debates surrounding UN Security Council reform.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ICC's jurisdiction is not limited to heads of state or government officials. It can prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression, regardless of their official position or status.  The principle of individual criminal responsibility is central to the ICC's mandate, meaning that any person who commits these crimes can be held accountable, regardless of their political affiliation or power.

Statement 2 is correct.  Under the Rome Statute, which established the ICC, member states are legally obliged to cooperate fully with the court. This includes arresting and surrendering individuals who are indicted by the ICC, even if those individuals are their own citizens or are located within their territory.  This cooperation is crucial for ensuring the court's effectiveness and upholding international criminal justice.  Failure to cooperate can lead to sanctions and other consequences.

While the NDB aims to support development in BRICS nations and emerging economies globally, its location in Shanghai reflects the significant role of China in its establishment and operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides short-term liquidity support, the NDB's primary focus is on financing infrastructure projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.  It aims to provide a more equitable and diversified source of development funding, supplementing existing international financial institutions.  The NDB's focus on infrastructure development is reflected in its lending portfolio and strategic priorities.

Statement 1 is correct. The AFSPA grants extensive powers to the armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" under the act. These powers include the authority to arrest individuals without warrants, conduct searches without prior notice, and use force, even to the extent of causing death, if deemed necessary.  The act's provisions have been a subject of significant debate and controversy regarding human rights implications.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The AFSPA has not been permanently repealed in all states of India.  While there have been calls for its repeal or amendment due to concerns about human rights violations, it remains in effect in certain regions of India where it is deemed necessary for maintaining security and public order.  The continued application of AFSPA in specific areas reflects the ongoing security challenges and the government's assessment of the need for such special powers.


**8. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII is a G7 initiative aimed at mobilizing private sector investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries.

1. NAM was founded during the Cold War era, aiming to provide a platform for countries to remain neutral in the ideological conflict between the US and the Soviet Union.
2. Currently, NAM comprises a diverse group of countries from across the globe, including many members of the G7.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM emerged during the Cold War as a response to the bipolar geopolitical system dominated by the US and the Soviet Union.  Many newly independent countries sought to avoid alignment with either superpower, maintaining their independence in foreign policy and promoting peaceful coexistence.  NAM's founding principles emphasized national sovereignty, non-interference in internal affairs, and peaceful resolution of conflicts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NAM includes a wide range of countries, it does *not* include members of the G7.  The G7 countries are generally considered to be aligned with the Western bloc, and their participation in NAM would contradict the movement's core principles of non-alignment.  NAM primarily consists of countries from the Global South, reflecting its historical origins and focus on the concerns of developing nations.


**10. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the largest member state of the Commonwealth, representing a significant portion of its total population.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPEF is not a traditional trade agreement focused on tariff reduction. Instead, it is a framework for cooperation on a range of economic issues, including supply chains, clean energy, and digital trade.  It does not involve the negotiation of binding tariff reductions, distinguishing it from traditional free trade agreements.

Statement 2 is correct. The Supply Chain Council, a key pillar of IPEF, is specifically focused on strengthening supply chain resilience and security.  This includes addressing risks associated with disruptions, promoting diversification, and enhancing transparency and collaboration among participating countries.  The council plays a significant role in promoting economic security and stability within the Indo-Pacific region.

The SCO's security focus reflects the security concerns of its member states in a region marked by various security threats.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Not all members of the SCO are also members of BRICS.  While there is some overlap between the two groups, they have different memberships and focuses.  The SCO has a broader geographical reach than BRICS, encompassing Central Asian countries that are not part of BRICS.


**14. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1.  ASEAN comprises ten member states located in Southeast Asia, and India is a full member of ASEAN.
2. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a key ASEAN institution focused primarily on economic and trade cooperation among member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While ASEAN does comprise ten member states in Southeast Asia, India is not a *full* member of ASEAN.  India is a Dialogue Partner, indicating a close relationship and active participation in ASEAN activities, but it does not hold full membership status with voting rights in the main ASEAN bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ARF focuses primarily on political and security issues in the Southeast Asian region. While economic and trade cooperation are important for ASEAN, they are primarily handled through other ASEAN institutions.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. SAARC operates on the principle of unanimity in decision-making.  This means that all member states must agree on any major decision, reflecting the organization's commitment to inclusivity and respect for the views of all participating nations.  However, this consensus requirement has also been a factor contributing to the challenges faced by SAARC in recent years.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While SAFTA aimed to reduce trade barriers, it has not led to substantial increases in intra-regional trade.  Several factors have hampered the effective implementation of SAFTA, including non-tariff barriers, differing regulatory frameworks, and political tensions among member states.  The limited progress in intra-regional trade highlights the challenges of regional economic integration in South Asia.


**16. With reference to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While OPEC+ includes many Middle Eastern oil-producing countries, its membership is not limited to that region.  It also includes non-OPEC oil-producing countries, expanding its reach and influence on global oil markets.  The inclusion of non-OPEC members reflects the need for broader coordination in managing global oil supply and demand.

Statement 2 is correct. OPEC+'s decisions on oil production quotas have a significant impact on global oil prices.  By coordinating production levels, OPEC+ can influence the global supply of oil, which in turn affects oil prices.  This influence makes OPEC+ a key player in the global energy market.  The organization's decisions are closely watched by governments, businesses, and consumers worldwide.


**17. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank focused exclusively on financing infrastructure projects in Asian countries.

They establish fundamental rules for the protection of victims of armed conflict, including civilians, wounded and sick combatants, prisoners of war, and those at sea.  The conventions aim to limit the suffering caused by war and ensure humane treatment of those affected.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Geneva Conventions aim to limit the suffering of war, they do not explicitly prohibit the use of all types of weapons.  The use of certain weapons, such as those causing unnecessary suffering, is restricted under various international treaties and customary international law, but the Geneva Conventions themselves do not create a comprehensive ban on all weapons systems.  The prohibition on specific weapons is addressed by other international agreements.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and while India is a significant trading partner for Bangladesh, it is not the *largest* in Asia; that position is held by other major economies like China.  The significant trade volume between India and Bangladesh highlights the deep economic interdependence between the two nations and the importance of maintaining strong bilateral ties for economic growth in the region. This reflects a successful and growing economic relationship fostered through various agreements and initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports High Speed Diesel (HSD), not crude oil.

This initiative aligns with India's broader efforts to promote digital payments and financial inclusion in the region. The adoption of RuPay highlights the potential of Indian financial technologies to expand their reach internationally and facilitate cross-border transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project, a significant infrastructure development initiative in the Maldives, is primarily funded and constructed by India, not China. This project underscores India's commitment to supporting the Maldives' infrastructure development and enhancing its connectivity. The scale and nature of the project highlight the importance of infrastructure development in fostering economic growth and regional integration.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII's focus is on developing nations, not developed ones.  The goal is to address infrastructure deficits in these countries, thereby promoting economic growth and development.  The statement incorrectly attributes the initiative's focus to developed nations and misrepresents its primary objective.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGII was indeed launched in 2022 by the G7 (Group of Seven) nations. Its core aim is to foster sustainable and inclusive infrastructure development in developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NAM's advocacy for Cuba highlights its continued relevance to Global South countries, not the Global North.  The NAM's influence is primarily felt among developing nations sharing similar geopolitical positions and concerns. The statement mistakenly places the NAM's influence within the Global North, misrepresenting its core membership and objectives.

Statement 2 is correct. The US's unilateral designation of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" does indeed subject the listed countries to significant economic, commercial, and financial penalties. These sanctions aim to isolate the targeted nations and pressure them to alter their policies.  The consequences can severely impact a country's ability to engage in international trade and access financial resources. The statement accurately reflects the impact of this US policy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant member of the Commonwealth, representing a substantial portion of its population, it is not the largest *financial* contributor.  The statement overstates India's financial contribution to the Commonwealth, misrepresenting its budgetary role.  The Commonwealth's funding mechanism involves diverse contributions from member states, not dominated by a single nation.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. CAATSA targets countries engaging in significant transactions with Russia, Iran, and North Korea.  While India has a strategic partnership with the US,  the exemption is not blanket.  The statement inaccurately portrays a complete exemption for India from all CAATSA sanctions.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India-UK relationship was indeed elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) during a virtual summit in 2021. While economic and trade cooperation are important aspects, the CSP encompasses a broader range of strategic and security cooperation as well.  The statement correctly identifies the upgrade in bilateral relations but underemphasizes the scope of the partnership.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port was indeed a significant initiative, but it was established through a *tripartite* agreement involving India, Iran, and Afghanistan, not just India and Iran.  The omission of Afghanistan is the key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Chabahar Port does strategically reduce the travel distance from India's west coast to landlocked Central Asian nations. Its alignment with the INSTC further enhances its importance as an alternative route to the Suez Canal, significantly impacting trade and connectivity.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, is the longest maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2. India's recent shift of fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route is primarily due to geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal is the *shortest*, not the longest, maritime route between Asia and Europe.  This plays on the examinee's general knowledge of the canal's significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While geopolitical tensions might be a contributing factor, the provided text doesn't explicitly state that as the primary reason.  The question introduces this as a plausible, yet ultimately incorrect, explanation. The actual reason is not provided in the given text.


**5. With reference to India-Nepal relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship forms the basis of the bilateral relationship between India and Nepal, and it has been recently renegotiated to reflect current geopolitical realities.
2.  India is Nepal's largest trading partner and a major source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), but Nepal maintains a consistent trade surplus with India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship is indeed foundational to India-Nepal relations, but the statement falsely claims it's been recently renegotiated.  This is a deliberate attempt to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is Nepal's largest trading partner and a major source of FDI, the statement wrongly asserts that Nepal holds a trade surplus with India.  India actually holds the trade surplus.


**6. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2007 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan replaced the 1949 treaty, significantly altering the framework of their bilateral relationship.
2.  India's Prime Minister conferring the "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" on the Bhutanese Prime Minister signifies the strong cultural ties and mutual respect between the two nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1949 treaty was *renewed* in 2007, not replaced.  The subtle difference in wording ("replaced" vs. "renewed") is a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The awarding of the "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" is a significant gesture highlighting the strong and close relationship between India and Bhutan.  The question focuses on the symbolic meaning of the award, testing the candidate's understanding of diplomatic relations.


**7. Consider the following statements regarding the Kargil War:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar, undertaken by the Indian Navy, played a crucial role in targeting Pakistani troops positioned at high altitudes during the Kargil conflict.
2. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC), headed by K. Subrahmanyam, was established immediately after the war's conclusion to assess the conflict's strategic and tactical aspects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an air force operation, not a naval one. This is a deliberate attempt to confuse the candidate by mixing up the branches of the armed forces involved.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. The KRC was established in July 1999, which was shortly after the war, but the phrasing "immediately after" is inaccurate and designed to be a distractor.  The timing is close enough to mislead those with less precise knowledge of the event's timeline.


**8. With reference to the weaponization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of all types of weapons in outer space, irrespective of their destructive capacity.
2. Russia's veto of a UN Security Council resolution on a weapon-free outer space was primarily due to concerns about the resolution's focus solely on nuclear weapons, ignoring other potential space-based weaponry.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in outer space, but it doesn't explicitly ban all types of weapons.  The distinction between WMDs and other weapons systems is a key detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is correct. Russia's veto was indeed based on its concerns that the resolution focused disproportionately on WMDs while neglecting other potential space-based weapons that could be used for military purposes.


**9.  Consider the following statements concerning the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200-km-long multimodal transport network primarily designed to connect India with Southeast Asia via Iran and Central Asia.
2. The INSTC serves as an alternative route to the Suez Canal, offering a potentially shorter shipping route for goods between India and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INSTC is indeed 7,200 km long and multimodal, it connects India with *Russia and Europe*, not Southeast Asia, via Iran and Central Asia.  The substitution of Southeast Asia for Europe is a deliberate distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The INSTC is indeed positioned as a viable alternative to the Suez Canal, potentially offering a more efficient route for goods transportation between India and Europe, although its full operational potential is still under development.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the TAPI pipeline does originate in the Galkynysh gas field, the statement incorrectly places it 1800 km from Ashgabat. The accurate distance is closer to 75km from Mary,  a city in Turkmenistan. This slight misrepresentation of distance is a key distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The TAPI pipeline's route accurately follows the path mentioned, aiming to enhance energy security and diversification for the participating nations.


**11.  Consider the following statements related to the Colombo Process:**

1.  The Colombo Process is a regional initiative focused on addressing the issue of human trafficking in South Asia.
2.  India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process indicates its growing engagement in regional security cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Colombo Process is primarily concerned with irregular migration, not solely human trafficking, although the latter is a related issue.  The narrowing of the focus to only human trafficking is a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. India's chairmanship highlights its increased involvement in regional cooperation mechanisms concerning migration and related security concerns.


**12. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders, ranked India among the top 50 countries in terms of press freedom.
2. The theme of WPFI 2024 was “A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis.”

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 was significantly lower than the top 50, placing it at 159 out of 180 countries.  This is a significant numerical distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The theme of the WPFI 2024 accurately reflects the chosen topic.  This is a straightforward factual recall question.


**13. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India assesses the country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2020 and has been consistently updated to reflect the evolving nature of financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER accurately covers the areas mentioned.  This is a straightforward factual question.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The first adoption of India's MER was in 2010, not 2020.  The slight change in the year is a distractor.


**14. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report identifies cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines.
2. The report highlights the "Golden Crescent" region (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) and the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) as regions with high levels of drug trafficking and abuse.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The order of drug abuse prevalence mentioned is accurate according to the report.

Statement 2 is also correct. The report does highlight both the "Golden Crescent" and "Triple Frontier Area" as significant regions affected by drug trafficking.  This is a question testing factual recall.


**15.  Consider the following statements about the Maldives:**

1. The Maldives archipelago is geographically located in the Indian Ocean, with its closest neighboring countries being India and Sri Lanka.
2. India's development projects in the Maldives, such as the Greater Male Connectivity Project, are examples of its commitment to strengthening economic ties with the island nation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, its closest neighbors are India to the northeast and Sri Lanka is considerably further away.  The inclusion of Sri Lanka as a close neighbor is a geographical distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. India's various development projects in the Maldives clearly demonstrate its commitment to fostering economic cooperation and friendly relations.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's foreign policy initiatives.



**1. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia. However,  India is *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  This subtle difference makes statement 1 partially correct, but sufficiently accurate for a UPSC-style question focused on the broader relationship.  The emphasis here is on the significant trade volume between the two nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports High Speed Diesel (HSD), not crude oil. This fact is crucial for understanding energy cooperation between the two countries, and its inaccuracy makes the statement entirely false.  The question tests knowledge of specific details within the broader context of bilateral relations.  The inclusion of a partially correct statement and a completely incorrect statement ensures a challenging question that requires careful analysis.

1. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam primarily aims to enhance electricity trade between India and Nepal.
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily focused on supplying electricity to Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor is designed to enhance electricity trade between India and *Bangladesh*, not Nepal. This highlights the importance of understanding the specific geographical locations and their implications for regional energy cooperation.  The statement tests the candidate's ability to recall project details and accurately associate them with participating nations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily aimed at supplying electricity to *India*, not Bangladesh. This detail is crucial for evaluating the nature and direction of energy flows in the region. The incorrect association of projects with recipient countries demonstrates a lack of understanding of specific energy infrastructure projects and their beneficiaries.


**3. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was primarily driven by pro-Pakistan sentiments.
2. Operation Neer was launched by India to provide medical assistance to the Maldives during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was largely fueled by pro-*China* sentiments, not pro-Pakistan.  This highlights the geopolitical complexities of the Indian Ocean region and the competing influences of major powers. The incorrect attribution of the campaign's origin tests the candidate's understanding of regional dynamics and their ability to correctly identify the driving force behind specific political movements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Neer was launched to provide *water* assistance during a water crisis, not medical assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Vaccine Maitri was the initiative that focused on supplying vaccines to the Maldives during the pandemic. Confusing the two initiatives demonstrates a lack of understanding of the specific humanitarian assistance programs undertaken by India.


**4. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chabahar Port is located on the Arabian Sea, providing a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.
2.  The INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor) initiative primarily aims to connect India with Southeast Asia via the Chabahar Port.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the Chabahar Port is located on the Gulf of Oman (a part of the Arabian Sea), the statement accurately captures its geostrategic importance in providing a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. The minor geographical inaccuracy is overshadowed by the accurate depiction of its significance in regional connectivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The INSTC aims to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran and Central Asia, not Southeast Asia.  The incorrect association of the INSTC with Southeast Asia indicates a lack of understanding of the corridor's geographical scope and objectives. The inclusion of a largely correct and a completely incorrect statement creates a challenging question that necessitates careful analysis of details.


**5.  Consider the following statements concerning the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) complete control over all personnel, regardless of their service branch.
2. An ISO is defined as a body of troops exclusively composed of personnel from the Indian Army.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act indeed empowers the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with extensive disciplinary and administrative authority over all personnel, irrespective of their service branch (Army, Navy, or Air Force). This demonstrates an understanding of the implications of the Act on the organizational structure of the Indian armed forces.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An ISO is not exclusively composed of Army personnel; it can include personnel from any or all three branches of the Indian armed forces. This demonstrates a lack of understanding of the composition and nature of Inter-Services Organizations. The combination of a correct and an incorrect statement tests the candidate's knowledge of the Act's scope and the definition of key terms.


**6. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 2005 based on the recommendations of the K.C. Pant-led task force.
2.  The Strategic Policy Group (SPG) within the NSC structure is headed by the Minister of Defence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSCS was established in 1999, not 2005, based on the recommendations of the K.C. Pant-led task force. The incorrect year demonstrates a lack of understanding of the NSCS's historical context and its establishment timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Strategic Policy Group (SPG) is headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), not the Minister of Defence. The incorrect designation of the SPG's head reflects a misunderstanding of the NSC's organizational structure and the roles of key individuals within it. The question tests the candidate's ability to recall accurate details about the NSCS's formation and internal structure.


**7. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was first signed in 1949 and subsequently renewed in 2007.
2.  The majority of roads in Bhutan have been constructed by China under the project 'DANTAK'.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was indeed signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007. This demonstrates an understanding of the historical context of the bilateral relationship and the key agreements that shape it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The majority of roads in Bhutan have been constructed by India's Border Roads Organisation (BRO), not China, under Project DANTAK.  Attributing the construction of Bhutanese roads to China demonstrates a lack of knowledge about the nature of India's developmental assistance to Bhutan. The contrast between a correct statement and a completely false statement makes this a challenging question that requires accurate factual recall.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding BIMSTEC:**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2023 after its ratification by all member states.
2.  Nepal was the last member state to ratify the BIMSTEC Charter.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in May 2024, not 2023.  The incorrect year indicates a lack of precise knowledge about the timeline of the Charter's implementation.

Statement 2 is correct.  Nepal was indeed the last member state to ratify the BIMSTEC Charter, making its entry into force possible.  This demonstrates an understanding of the process of treaty ratification and the role of individual member states in regional cooperation.  The combination of an incorrect year and a correct statement regarding the final ratifying member makes this a challenging question that demands precise factual knowledge.


**9. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focuses primarily on combating breast cancer.
2. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to enhance port infrastructure development in the Arctic region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focuses on combating *cervical* cancer, not breast cancer.  This highlights the importance of knowing the specific diseases targeted by international collaborations. The incorrect disease specification tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details from significant international initiatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" is focused on sustainable port infrastructure development in the *Indo-Pacific region*, not the Arctic region.  The incorrect geographical location demonstrates a lack of understanding of the partnership's scope and geographical focus.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific Quad initiatives and their respective geographical areas of operation.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's third term on the INCB will commence in 2024.
2. The INCB's recent reports have highlighted cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jagjit Pavadia's third term on the INCB will commence in 2025, not 2024. The incorrect year reveals a lack of precision in recalling the commencement date of a significant appointment.

Statement 2 is correct. Recent INCB reports have indeed indicated cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids. This demonstrates an understanding of current trends in drug abuse as highlighted by international organizations.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of current events and the ability to recall information from reports of international bodies.



**1. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bangladesh is indeed India's biggest trading partner in South Asia. However,  India is the *second* biggest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  This subtle difference makes statement 1 partially correct, but the inaccuracy in the second part of the statement about India's ranking as Bangladesh's largest trading partner makes option (c) incorrect. Option (d) is also incorrect because statement 1 is partially correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports High Speed Diesel (HSD), not crude oil.  This factual error makes the statement completely false.  The pipeline is a significant symbol of bilateral cooperation in energy security, but its function needs to be accurately understood.  Confusing HSD with crude oil is a common distractor designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the project.


**2. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transportation network connecting India, Iran, Russia, and Central Asian countries, primarily aiming to reduce reliance on the Suez Canal.
2.  The INSTC was established in 2010 as a joint initiative between India, Iran, and Russia, with the primary goal of facilitating trade between India and Europe via Central Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The INSTC is indeed a multi-modal transport network aiming to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.  The approximate length is accurate, and the goal of providing an alternative route to the Suez Canal is a key objective. While the countries involved extend beyond just India, Iran and Russia (including Central Asian nations), the core statement about connectivity and reducing Suez Canal dependence is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The INSTC was established in 2000, not 2010.  This is a crucial factual error. The 2010 date is a distractor; while various agreements and expansions might have occurred around that time, the foundational agreement dates back to 2000.  The goal is also not solely focused on India-Europe trade but encompasses broader connectivity across the region.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding Bhutan:**

1. Bhutan shares borders with five Indian states: Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, Sikkim, and Meghalaya.
2. The Amo Chu River, which flows into West Bengal, is known as the Torsa River in that state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Bhutan shares borders with only four Indian states: Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Sikkim. Meghalaya is not a bordering state. Including Meghalaya is a deliberate error intended to test the candidate's precise geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Amo Chu River is indeed known as the Torsa River once it enters West Bengal. This demonstrates a specific understanding of regional geography and river systems relevant to India-Bhutan relations.  The seemingly minor detail of the river's name change is a significant point of knowledge in the context of the question.


**4. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chabahar Port, located on the Arabian Sea, provides India with a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.
2.  The tripartite agreement for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port was signed in 2017 between India, Iran, and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Chabahar Port's strategic location on the Gulf of Oman (part of the Arabian Sea) offers India a crucial alternative route to Afghanistan, circumventing the need to transit through Pakistan. This is a critical geopolitical aspect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The tripartite agreement for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port was signed in 2016, not 2017. This seemingly minor discrepancy in the year is a key detail designed to test the candidate's precise knowledge of the chronology of events related to the project.


**5. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives as part of a broader initiative to enhance financial connectivity and reduce reliance on other international payment systems.
2. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was primarily driven by concerns about India's economic influence and its support for the incumbent government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of the RuPay card in the Maldives is a significant step in enhancing financial integration between the two countries, offering an alternative payment system and strengthening economic ties.

Statement 2 is partially correct but oversimplified. While concerns about Indian economic influence played a role in the "India Out" campaign, it was more complex and involved a mix of factors including political and strategic considerations, not solely limited to economic concerns.  The statement's focus on solely economic influence oversimplifies the motivations behind the campaign, making it inaccurate.


**6. With reference to the Colombo Process, consider the following statements:**

1. The Colombo Process is a regional initiative focused on combating human trafficking and smuggling in the South Asian region.
2.  India recently chaired its first meeting as the Chair of the Colombo Process, highlighting its commitment to regional cooperation on migration management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is also correct. India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process underscores its growing role in regional cooperation on migration management and its commitment to addressing the challenges of irregular migration.


**7. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders, ranked India lower than the previous year, reflecting concerns about press freedom in the country.
2. The theme of WPFI 2024 was "Journalism for Peace: Reporting in Conflict Zones."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. While the exact ranking might vary slightly depending on the source, the overall trend reflects a decline in India's ranking in the WPFI 2024, indicating ongoing concerns regarding press freedom.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The theme of WPFI 2024 was "A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis," not "Journalism for Peace: Reporting in Conflict Zones."  This is a critical factual inaccuracy that serves as a key distractor.


**8. With reference to the Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is located in the northeastern part of Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  A recent survey conducted by UNESCO and the World Food Programme revealed a significant decline in fish stocks in Lake Turkana.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana's location in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia is accurate, and it is indeed the world's largest permanent desert lake.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The recent survey revealed *high*, not a decline in, fish potential in Lake Turkana. This directly contradicts the information presented, making it a strong distractor. The survey's findings highlight the lake's potential as a source of food security, contrasting with the statement's assertion of declining fish stocks.


**9. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Kenya and is the highest mountain in Africa.
2.  A recent expedition team, under the aegis of the Indian Ministry of Defence, hoisted the Indian national flag at the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya.  The location is a crucial detail that can easily lead to incorrect answers if not accurately recalled.  While both countries are in East Africa, the specific location is important.

Statement 2 is correct.  The recent expedition and flag-hoisting event are accurately described.


**10.  With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan and is a significant route for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.
2.  Indian traders are currently demanding the reopening of the Lipulekh Pass for border trade with Nepal, which was closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The inclusion of Bhutan is a deliberate error intended to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the region's geography.

Statement 2 is correct. The demand for reopening the pass for trade with Nepal is accurate, and the reason cited (COVID-19 closure) is also correct.  The statement accurately reflects a current geopolitical issue.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of measures against illicit drug trade.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key Indian institutions involved in combating money laundering, established in 2004 and 1956 respectively.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly assesses measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While illicit drug trade is a significant concern, it's not explicitly mentioned as a core component of the FATF's MER assessment. The scope is focused on the financial aspects of these crimes.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FIU-IND and the ED are indeed crucial institutions in India's anti-money laundering efforts.  The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a central role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence, while the ED, established in 1956, enforces laws related to economic offenses, including money laundering. The dates mentioned are accurate.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India-Bangladesh relations:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  Key initiatives in India-Bangladesh energy cooperation include the upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar and the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bangladesh is indeed a major trading partner for India in South Asia, the statement incorrectly states that India is Bangladesh's *largest* trading partner in Asia.  India is a significant partner, but not the largest.  The provided text does not give a definitive answer on the largest partner.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) as a key initiative in India-Bangladesh energy cooperation, along with the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant.  These are accurate details.


**3. With reference to the UNODC reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The report also highlights the "Death Triangle" (formerly the Golden Triangle) as a significant drug-producing region.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 is mentioned as being released concurrently with the World Drug Day report, but the specific details of the wildlife crime report's content are not provided.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text clearly states that the UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug, followed by the others listed.  The renaming of the Golden Triangle to the Death Triangle is also mentioned.

Statement 2 is correct. While the specific contents of the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 are not detailed in the given text, the text does mention its release alongside the World Drug Day report, making the statement factually accurate based on the provided information.


**4. With reference to India's international relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, but is not a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention.
2.  India's participation in the International Solar Alliance and the Global Biofuel Alliance is mentioned in the context of India-Singapore relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India is a signatory to the CWC and has enacted the corresponding act. It does not state that India is *not* a signatory to the Biological Weapons Convention; the provided text simply does not mention India's status regarding the Biological Weapons Convention.  Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text specifically mentions Singapore's joining of the International Solar Alliance and the Global Biofuel Alliance, and places this within the discussion of India-Singapore relations, indicating India's involvement in these alliances.



**5. Consider the following statements concerning India's defense agreements:**

1. The Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between India and the US is a legally binding agreement ensuring the timely provision of defense-related goods and services.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), Industrial Security Agreement, and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) are all defense agreements signed between India and the US.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the SOSA is *legally non-binding*.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text lists LEMOA, COMCASA, the Industrial Security Agreement, and BECA as defense agreements between India and the US.  The information is accurately presented.


**6. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  The India-Nepal energy cooperation projects include the Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects (UKHP).
2. The TAPI pipeline is a project focused on cross-border electricity trade, alongside the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline and the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text specifically mentions Arun III and UKHP as examples of India-Nepal energy cooperation projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TAPI, India-Bangladesh Friendship, and Motihari-Amlekhganj pipelines are mentioned, they are described as *energy pipelines* transporting natural gas, not electricity.  The statement misrepresents their function in the context of cross-border electricity trade.


**7. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives and both countries signed a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA).
2.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives refers to a movement advocating for the withdrawal of Indian economic aid and development projects from the Maldives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text confirms that India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives and that a CSA was signed between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign, as described in the text, specifically refers to a push for the withdrawal of *Indian military personnel*, not economic aid or development projects. The statement incorrectly describes the focus of the campaign.


**8.  Consider the following statements about India-China relations:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon, with clear boundary markers.
2. The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash between India and China since 1962.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the border between India and China is *not* formally demarcated and there is no mutually agreed LAC.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately identifies the Galwan incident of 2020 as the deadliest since 1962.


**9. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 has a permanent structure with a fixed headquarters and a permanent secretariat.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is an initiative launched by the G7 to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the G7 *lacks* a permanent structure.  It operates on a rotating presidency system.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the PGII as a G7 initiative aimed at funding infrastructure projects in developing countries.  The information is accurate.


**10. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India has a trade deficit with the US, amounting to $19.59 billion.
2. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) aims to punish countries engaging deeply with Russia, North Korea, and Iran through economic sanctions, and India has never faced any sanctions under this act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India has a *trade surplus* with the US, not a deficit, of $19.59 billion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While CAATSA's purpose is accurately described, the text explicitly mentions the US State Department warning India of *potential* sanctions under CAATSA after the India-Iran deal on the Chabahar port.  This indicates that the possibility of sanctions exists, contradicting the statement.


**1. With reference to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), consider the following statements:**

1. The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA), functioning as its secretary, and is the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee.
2.  The CDS exercises direct military command over the three Service Chiefs (Army, Navy, and Air Force).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CDS, a four-star General equivalent in rank to a Service Chief, heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) within the Ministry of Defence and acts as its secretary.  Critically, the CDS also serves as the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, a crucial body for inter-service coordination. This role is central to the CDS's mandate of improving tri-service synergy and efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. A key aspect of the CDS's role is that they *do not* exercise direct military command over the three Service Chiefs.  The Service Chiefs retain their operational command authority over their respective branches. The CDS's authority is primarily focused on integrating the services, advising the government on military matters, and streamlining defense processes.  Confusing the advisory and integrative functions of the CDS with direct command authority is a common misconception.  The structure is designed to maintain the operational independence of the individual services while fostering greater coordination at the strategic level.


**2. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 2001 based on recommendations from the K. Subrahmanyam Committee Report.
2. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), functions under the NSCS and coordinates national security policies across various ministries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The National Security Council (NSC), under which the NSCS operates, was constituted in 1999, based on recommendations from a K.C. Pant-led task force, not the K. Subrahmanyam Committee Report.  The timeline is crucial here, as the K. Subrahmanyam Committee's report is associated with the creation of the CDS post, not the NSC.  Attributing the NSC's establishment to the wrong committee demonstrates a lack of precision in understanding the institutional history of India's national security apparatus.

Statement 2 is correct. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), a key component of the NSC structure, is indeed headed by the NSA and plays a vital role in ensuring inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies. This coordination is essential for the effective implementation of national security strategies and avoids duplication or conflict between different ministries. The SPG's function highlights the NSC's focus on integrated and holistic national security management.


**3. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) disciplinary powers only over personnel from the same service branch.
2. An ISO is defined as a body of troops comprising personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957, or any two of these Acts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2023 Act significantly empowers the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with disciplinary and administrative powers over *all* serving or attached personnel within the ISO, regardless of their original service branch (Army, Navy, or Air Force). This is a crucial aspect of the Act, aiming to streamline command and control within joint organizations.  Restricting disciplinary powers to personnel from a single service would undermine the purpose of creating unified commands.

Statement 2 is correct. The Act defines an ISO precisely as a body of troops that includes personnel subject to any combination of the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957. This inclusive definition is key to understanding the scope of the Act's application and its impact on the organizational structure of the Indian Armed Forces.  The flexibility in the composition of ISOs is a critical feature, allowing for varied configurations depending on the specific needs of a particular organization.


**4.  With reference to the Kargil War and Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Vijay was launched to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants who infiltrated the Siachen Glacier region of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. The primary objective of Operation Vijay was to reclaim Indian territory occupied by Pakistani forces during the conflict.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Pakistani infiltration was a key element of the Kargil conflict, the infiltration primarily occurred in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, not the Siachen Glacier.  The geographical location of the infiltration is a crucial detail that distinguishes the Kargil War from other conflicts in the region.  Confusing the location highlights a lack of precise knowledge of the war's specifics.

Statement 2 is correct.  The core objective of Operation Vijay was indeed to reclaim Indian territory that had been infiltrated and occupied by Pakistani forces and militants during the Kargil War.  This territorial objective was central to the military strategy and the overall political context of the conflict.  The successful execution of Operation Vijay resulted in the expulsion of Pakistani forces and the restoration of Indian control over the affected areas.


**5. With reference to the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and is peer-reviewed by FATF members.
2. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, are among the key legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India provides a comprehensive assessment of the country's efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  This peer review process is a critical aspect of the FATF's work, ensuring accountability and transparency among its member countries. The MER highlights India's commitment to global standards in combating financial crime.

Statement 2 is also correct. Both the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, are significant legal instruments used by India to address money laundering and related financial crimes.  These Acts provide the legal framework for investigations, prosecutions, and asset seizures related to financial crimes.  Understanding the role of these Acts is essential for appreciating the legal mechanisms employed by India in its fight against financial crime.  The interplay between these two acts and other related legislation shows a multi-pronged approach by India.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is subjective and depends on the examinee's prior knowledge.  I've aimed for a challenging level by incorporating subtle inaccuracies and plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Commonwealth of Nations:**

1.  The Commonwealth Games, held in New Delhi in 2010, were the first major sporting event hosted by a Commonwealth member nation in the 21st century.
2.  The India-UN Development Fund's Commonwealth Sub-Window, established in 2018, allocated $100 million over a 5-year period.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While New Delhi did host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, it was not the first such event in the 21st century.  Other Commonwealth Games were held before 2010.  The statement incorrectly implies exclusivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the Commonwealth Sub-Window received $50 million, not $100 million, over five years.  A simple numerical error creates a plausible distractor.


**2. With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, which resulted in the adoption of a Joint Action Plan (2024-2028), was the first such meeting between the two entities.
2.  The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2003, marking the beginning of formal political engagement between India and the GCC nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that a Joint Action Plan was adopted at a *recent* meeting, but doesn't claim it was the first India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting.  The use of the word "recent" is crucial for creating ambiguity. Prior meetings could have occurred.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions the 2003 date for the first India-GCC Political Dialogue.


**3. With reference to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functions as its secretary, but does not directly command any of the three service chiefs (Army, Navy, Air Force).
2.  The recommendation for the creation of the CDS post originated from a Group of Ministers (GoM) report in 2001, which was based on the Shri K Subrahmanyam Committee Report from an earlier year.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are correct.  The passage clearly states the CDS's role within the DMA and the lack of direct command over service chiefs.  It also correctly attributes the recommendation for the CDS post to the 2001 GoM report, which was based on the Shri K Subrahmanyam Committee Report.


**4. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 1998, based on recommendations from a task force headed by K.C. Pant.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), provides short-term analysis and policy recommendations to the National Security Council (NSC).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSCS was established in 1999, not 1998, based on K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations.  The one-year difference is a subtle but significant inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB provides *long-term*, not short-term, analysis and policy recommendations.  The alteration of "long-term" to "short-term" is a key distractor.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the India-Bangladesh relationship:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, showcasing their energy cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that Bangladesh is India's *biggest* trade partner in South Asia, but India is only Bangladesh's *second* biggest trade partner in Asia.  The subtle difference in ranking is a crucial point.

Statement 2 is correct. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is explicitly mentioned as an example of India-Bangladesh cooperation.


**6. With reference to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNSC has the power to make binding decisions on member states, but these decisions are subject to veto power from any of the five permanent members.
2. India has been elected to the non-permanent seat of the UNSC seven times.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  While the text doesn't explicitly mention veto power, it's a well-known fact about the UNSC's structure. The question tests knowledge beyond the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage states India has been elected eight times, not seven.  The one-number difference is a significant distractor.


**7. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas," including the authority to arrest and search premises without warrants, but it does not allow them to open fire at will without any legal justification.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, and also in Jammu and Kashmir through a separate act.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AFSPA *does* grant the power to open fire, albeit under specified circumstances. The statement subtly misrepresents the extent of the powers granted.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately reflects the current applicability of AFSPA and its separate application in Jammu and Kashmir.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding international conventions related to weapons:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, but it does not address their use.
2. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, including the use of chemical and biological weapons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the *development, production, and stockpiling, and use* of biological weapons. The statement omits the crucial element of prohibition on use.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rome Statute and the ICC's jurisdiction are accurately described in the passage.  However, the ICC's jurisdiction is not limited to chemical and biological weapons.


These questions are designed to be challenging and require a thorough understanding of the facts and their nuances.  They avoid simple recall and instead test the ability to analyze, evaluate, and identify subtle inaccuracies.


**1. With reference to the Golden Crescent and Golden Triangle regions, consider the following statements:**

1. The Golden Crescent, now renamed the Death Crescent, comprises Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, known for significant opium production.
2. The Golden Triangle, now renamed the Death Triangle, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is a major hub for methamphetamine trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the geographic locations and the nature of illicit drug activities associated with the Golden Crescent and Golden Triangle regions.  The Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent) indeed includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, historically significant for opium poppy cultivation and heroin production.  Similarly, the Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle), encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, has long been notorious for its role in the production and trafficking of opium, heroin, and increasingly, methamphetamine.  The renaming reflects the increasingly deadly consequences of the drug trade in these areas.  While other drugs are also trafficked from these regions, the core description of the statements aligns with established knowledge on the subject.  Therefore, both statements are correct.


**2. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a quasi-judicial body responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's recent re-election to the INCB signifies India's continuous commitment to global drug control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The INCB is an independent and quasi-judicial body established under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.  It monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties and conventions, making recommendations to states and reporting on global drug trends.  It doesn't have direct enforcement powers but plays a crucial role in international drug control governance.  Statement 2 is also correct.  The re-election of Jagjit Pavadia reflects India's ongoing participation and commitment to international collaborations in tackling the global drug problem.  India's presence on the INCB demonstrates its engagement with international drug control mechanisms.  Therefore, both statements are accurate.


**3. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused solely on combating transnational organized crime, neglecting other criminal justice issues.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to engage youth in crime prevention through educational programs and awareness campaigns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While the 33rd session of the CCPCJ did address transnational organized crime (TOC) as a major focus, it's inaccurate to say it *solely* focused on this issue.  The CCPCJ addresses a broad range of criminal justice concerns. Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. Statement 2 is correct. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, launched during the 33rd session, is specifically designed to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice. This initiative likely involves various approaches, including educational programs, community initiatives, and awareness campaigns to prevent youth involvement in crime.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lake Turkana is indeed the largest permanent desert lake in the world,  it is not the largest by surface area.  Lake Chad, though its size fluctuates significantly, can surpass Lake Turkana in surface area during periods of high water levels.  The question plays on the ambiguity of "largest" by implying surface area when the text specifies it's the largest *permanent* desert lake.  This requires careful reading and understanding of the nuances of the description.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River, originating in the Ethiopian highlands, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.  This is a key fact about the lake's hydrology and its dependence on a transboundary river.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is a dormant stratovolcano.  While the text doesn't explicitly state the precise composition as basalt and andesite, these are common components of stratovolcanoes, and the presence of glacial features is well-documented.  The statement uses slightly more specific geological terminology than the text to increase the difficulty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although Mount Kilimanjaro is located in East Africa, it is *not* part of the East African Rift system.  It's a freestanding mountain, formed by volcanic activity separate from the rifting processes that created the Rift Valley. This is a crucial distinction in understanding the mountain's geological origins.

Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the geological context of Mount Kilimanjaro's formation.  The question tests the understanding of specific geological processes and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct geological features.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Black Sea.  This is a fundamental geographical error. The question uses a similar-sounding body of water to create confusion.

Statement 2 is correct. Shifting fuel exports from the shorter Suez Canal route to the much longer Cape of Good Hope route inevitably leads to increased transportation costs and significantly longer transit times. This is a straightforward consequence of the geographical change.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccurate description of the Suez Canal's connection.  The question tests both geographical accuracy and the understanding of logistical implications.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the MER does assess India's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  the crucial detail is the year of its *first* adoption.  The provided statement incorrectly states it was 2002; it was actually first adopted in 2010. This subtle error necessitates precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a vital role in India's anti-money laundering efforts. Its functions include receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies. The accuracy of this statement contrasts with the inaccuracy of statement 1, requiring the candidate to evaluate both statements independently.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Chabahar Port's location does indeed offer a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan, the statement incorrectly claims it primarily uses the Suez Canal for transporting goods to Central Asia.  Chabahar Port is designed to provide an alternative route to the Suez Canal, aiming to reduce transportation time and costs to Central Asia, and is connected to the INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor). This factual inaccuracy concerning the primary route highlights the importance of precise geographical and logistical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The tripartite agreement between India, Iran, and Afghanistan in 2016 for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port is a well-documented event that significantly impacts regional geopolitics and trade relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB does monitor and report illicit nuclear trafficking, it's inaccurate to restrict its scope to only UN member states. The database tracks incidents globally, regardless of whether the involved nations are UN members. The statement also implies an exclusivity that is false.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Atoms4Food does use nuclear techniques to improve global food security, but stating that it primarily focuses on increasing crop yields through genetic modification is an oversimplification and an inaccurate representation of its multifaceted approach. The program employs various nuclear techniques across different aspects of food production, not solely genetic modification.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the breadth of the IAEA's programs beyond a superficial level.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC charter did come into force after all member states ratified it, granting it legal personality, but the year mentioned is inaccurate. The charter came into force in May 2024, not May 2023.  This highlights the importance of precise chronological knowledge.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity aims to enhance regional connectivity, it's inaccurate to state that it primarily focuses on high-speed rail networks and prioritizing travel time between capital cities. The plan encompasses a broader range of transport infrastructure projects, including road, sea, and air connectivity, with various priorities depending on the specific needs and context of each member state.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the comprehensive nature of the BIMSTEC Master Plan.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Lake Turkana is the world's largest *permanent* desert lake, it's not the largest by surface area.  That distinction belongs to another lake. The statement misrepresents the superlative.  Lake Turkana's significance lies in its size relative to its desert environment, not its overall global ranking in size.  This detail requires specific knowledge of geographical superlatives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Omo River, which is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana, originates in Ethiopia, not Kenya. This is a crucial detail about the lake's hydrology and its transboundary nature, often relevant in geopolitical discussions.  Confusing the source country highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge in UPSC-style questions.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall and differentiate specific geographical details.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a dormant stratovolcano, but it's located in Tanzania, not Kenya.  This error in location is a common distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of African geography. The question emphasizes the importance of accurate geographical location in relation to prominent landmarks.

Statement 2 is correct.  Mount Kilimanjaro is renowned for being the highest free-standing mountain globally. This fact is widely known, but including it alongside a geographically misleading statement increases the question's difficulty and tests the candidate's ability to discern accurate information from plausible but incorrect details.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  This subtle change in the country involved highlights the importance of precision in geopolitical knowledge, a key aspect of UPSC examinations. The incorrect inclusion of Bhutan as a bordering country acts as a sophisticated distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Lipulekh Pass is strategically important due to its role in shortening the travel route for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. This fact is relevant to understanding India's strategic interests in the region and its relationship with neighboring countries.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the geopolitical significance of the pass.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This is a fundamental error in geographical knowledge, designed to test the candidate's understanding of basic global waterways. The incorrect oceans act as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Suez Canal significantly reduces the travel time and distance for ships traveling between Asia and Europe, making it a crucial maritime route. This fact is important for understanding global trade and shipping patterns. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the canal's economic and strategic importance.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF's MER does assess measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's inaccurate to say it *excludes* cybercrime.  The FATF's mandate is broad and evolving, and while it may not have a dedicated section specifically labeled "cybercrime," the interconnectedness of financial crimes and cyber activities means measures to combat cyber-enabled financial crimes are implicitly considered within the broader assessment.  The FATF's recommendations increasingly address the cyber dimension of financial crime.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The peer review process is a core component of FATF's methodology, ensuring a degree of consistency and objectivity in evaluating member countries' compliance with international standards.  The use of a standardized methodology is crucial for ensuring fair and comparable assessments across diverse national contexts.

The precise ranking of opioids, cocaine, and amphetamines can vary slightly depending on the specific data and methodologies used in different UNODC reports.  Additionally, there is no information provided within the source text about ecstasy showing a significant decline.  The statement oversimplifies and potentially misrepresents the nuanced findings of the UNODC reports.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC consistently identifies the regions previously known as the "Golden Triangle" and "Golden Crescent," now often referred to as "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent," respectively, as major hubs for illicit drug production and trafficking.  The geographic locations and countries involved remain consistent in UNODC assessments.

1. The IPEF's Clean Economy pillar focuses exclusively on renewable energy sources, excluding any support for fossil fuel-based energy technologies or initiatives.
2. The IPEF's Fair Economy pillar aims to enhance tax transparency and resource mobilization through measures like combating corruption and improving cross-border investigations, but does not address issues related to labor standards or worker rights.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IPEF's Clean Economy pillar strongly emphasizes clean energy technologies, it is inaccurate to state that it *exclusively* focuses on renewable sources and excludes fossil fuels entirely.  The nuanced approach to the clean energy transition might involve various strategies, including some transition technologies that may not be purely renewable.  The statement presents an overly simplistic interpretation of the IPEF's multifaceted approach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The description of the IPEF's Fair Economy pillar is incomplete. While tax transparency, resource mobilization, anti-corruption measures, and cross-border investigations are key components, it's misleading to suggest that labor standards and worker rights are entirely excluded.  The IPEF's broader goals often encompass considerations of fair labor practices, although these may not be explicitly detailed in every aspect of the Fair Economy pillar's implementation.  The statement omits crucial elements of the Fair Economy's scope.


**5. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the BIMSTEC Charter coming into force grants the organization legal personality, enhancing its ability to engage in international relations and agreements.  This is a significant development for the organization's institutional capacity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement falsely claims that BIMSTEC excludes a focus on health or disaster management.  The text itself mentions BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX), clearly indicating an active involvement in disaster management. While the seven focus areas listed don't explicitly mention "health" as a separate category, health considerations are likely integrated within other focus areas like agriculture and food security.  The statement is too categorical in its exclusion.


**1. With reference to UN Peacekeeping Operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023, India's contribution to UN peacekeeping forces was the second-highest globally, surpassed only by Bangladesh.
2.  The majority of UN peacekeeping deployments in 2023 were concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India was the *highest* contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, not the second-highest. This statement attempts to mislead by offering a plausible but incorrect ranking.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East and North Africa.  This is a direct contradiction of the statement, serving as a strong distractor for those who might have a general understanding of UN peacekeeping operations but lack precise knowledge of 2023 deployments.  The question tests factual recall of specific data points.


**2. With reference to India's Bilateral Military Exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint military exercise between India and the United Kingdom, focusing primarily on counter-terrorism operations.
2. Exercise Nomadic Elephant, a joint military exercise between India and Mongolia, is typically conducted in the Ladakh region of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint military exercise between India and the *United States*, not the United Kingdom.  The statement attempts to create confusion by substituting a close but incorrect partner nation. The focus is also on broader military cooperation, not solely on counter-terrorism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Exercise Nomadic Elephant is indeed a joint military exercise between India and Mongolia, it is conducted in *Meghalaya*, not Ladakh.  This is a crucial detail that highlights the need for precise recall of locations associated with these exercises.  The question tests both factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar geographical locations.


**3. With reference to the Inter-Services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) the power to override decisions made by the respective service chiefs (Army, Navy, Air Force) in disciplinary matters.
2. An ISO, as defined by the Act, can only consist of personnel from a single service (Army, Navy, or Air Force), not a combination of services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act empowers the C-i-C and O-i-C with disciplinary and administrative powers, but it doesn't grant them the authority to *override* decisions of service chiefs.  The statement introduces a misleading element of hierarchical power dynamics, testing the candidate's understanding of the nuances of the Act.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Act explicitly defines an ISO as a body that *can* include personnel from any two or all three services (Army, Navy, Air Force). This directly contradicts the statement, serving as a strong distractor.  The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately interpret legal definitions within a specific context.


**4. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 2004 as part of the broader restructuring of India's national security apparatus following the 2001 terrorist attacks.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the NSA, primarily focuses on short-term tactical assessments and immediate policy recommendations to the NSC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NSC was constituted in 1999, based on the K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations, not in 2004. The year is altered to create a plausible but incorrect timeline.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the historical context of the NSCS's establishment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB, headed by the NSA, focuses on *long-term* strategic analysis and policy recommendations, not short-term tactical assessments.  The timeframe is reversed to create a misleading contrast with the functions of the Strategic Policy Group (SPG).  This demonstrates the need for precise understanding of the roles and responsibilities of different bodies within the NSC structure.


**5. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. India is not a signatory to the CWC, primarily due to concerns about its impact on India's domestic chemical industry.
2. The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) is responsible for enforcing the CWC and verifying the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that India *is* a signatory and party to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000. This statement attempts to create doubt by suggesting a false reason for India's non-participation.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's stance on international arms control treaties.

Statement 2 is correct. The OPCW is indeed responsible for enforcing the CWC and verifying the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles. This is a straightforward fact about the OPCW's role.  The question tests factual recall of the organization's key functions.


**6. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF, first adopted in 2010, highlighted significant deficiencies in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, the text doesn't state that it highlighted *significant deficiencies*.  The statement introduces a negative connotation to create uncertainty.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the nature and purpose of the FATF's evaluation process.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND's role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence is accurately described.  This serves as a straightforward fact to contrast with the more nuanced statement 1.  The question tests factual knowledge of key Indian institutions involved in combating financial crime.


**7. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 identified cocaine as the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis and opioids.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlighted the "Golden Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) as the primary source of illicit wildlife trafficking.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report identified *cannabis* as the most abused drug, not cocaine. This is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's ability to remember specific data from the report.  The question uses a plausible but incorrect ranking of drug abuse to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the "Golden Triangle" remains a significant region for drug production, the report does not specifically identify it as the *primary* source of illicit wildlife trafficking. The statement incorrectly links drug trafficking with wildlife trafficking. This demonstrates the need for precise understanding of the different reports and their specific findings.  The question tests both factual recall and the ability to distinguish between related but distinct issues.


**1. With reference to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ARF was established in 1994, with India joining as a member in 1996.  
2.  The ARF comprises 27 members, including all ten ASEAN member states and fifteen ASEAN Dialogue Partners, focusing primarily on economic cooperation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was indeed established in 1994, and India joined in 1996.  This is a well-documented fact in international relations and ASEAN studies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ARF does include all ten ASEAN member states and numerous Dialogue Partners, the total membership is not precisely 27.  More importantly, the ARF's primary focus is not economic cooperation. Its mandate centers on political and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, providing a platform for dialogue and confidence-building measures among member states.  The emphasis on economic cooperation is a secondary aspect, often addressed through other ASEAN mechanisms.  The inaccurate number and misrepresentation of the ARF's core function make this statement incorrect.  The distractor is the inclusion of the correct number of ASEAN members and the mention of “Dialogue Partners,” which might seem plausible to an unprepared candidate.


**2. With reference to the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), consider the following statements:**

1. BCBPI, also known as BRICS Pay, is a blockchain-based payment system designed to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border transactions exclusively within the BRICS nations, thereby reducing reliance on the SWIFT system.
2.  The BCBPI aims to enhance financial integration among BRICS members and promote the use of local currencies for international trade, thereby bypassing the dollar dominance in global transactions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the goals and characteristics of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI).  Statement 1 correctly identifies its blockchain-based nature and its aim to provide an alternative to SWIFT for transactions within the BRICS group.  The use of blockchain technology is intended to improve efficiency and reduce costs.  Statement 2 is also correct in highlighting the initiative's broader objective of promoting financial integration and reducing dependence on the US dollar in international trade among BRICS nations. The diversification of currency usage is a key element of the BCBPI's strategic significance.  The potential for reduced reliance on the dollar is a major factor driving the initiative.


**3. With reference to the ASEAN Future Forum, consider the following statements:**

1. Proposed by Indonesia at the 42nd ASEAN Summit in 2022, the ASEAN Future Forum aims to act as a platform for ASEAN member states and partner countries to discuss and formulate strategies for regional economic integration and development.
2.  India is a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum, actively participating in its policy discussions and contributing to the development of its strategic agenda.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ASEAN Future Forum is designed to be a platform for sharing ideas and policy recommendations, its proposal originated from Vietnam at the 43rd ASEAN Summit in 2023, not Indonesia in 2022. The focus is broader than just economic integration and includes various aspects of regional cooperation. The incorrect country and summit year are designed to be distractors.

Statement 2 is correct.  India is indeed a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum, actively engaging in its discussions and contributing to its agenda. This reflects India's commitment to strengthening its ties with ASEAN.


**4. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA, signed in 2008, aims to eliminate tariffs on almost all goods traded between ASEAN member states and India, leading to a significant increase in bilateral trade volumes and economic integration.
2.  Currently, India enjoys a substantial trade surplus with ASEAN nations due to the successful implementation of AITIGA, which has greatly facilitated the export of Indian goods to the region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  AITIGA, signed in 2009 (not 2008), aims to reduce, not eliminate, trade barriers between India and ASEAN. While it has led to increased trade, the description of “almost all goods” and the implication of complete tariff elimination is an overstatement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India currently experiences a trade deficit (not surplus) with ASEAN.  This is a crucial fact that counters the positive implication of Statement 2.  The incorrect assertion about trade balance is a key distractor.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is a proposed multimodal transport corridor connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe via land and sea routes, primarily focused on enhancing energy security and trade relations between the three regions.
2.  The IMEC initiative is primarily driven by the European Union, seeking to diversify its energy sources and reduce its reliance on Russian energy supplies through enhanced cooperation with India and the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The IMEC is indeed a proposed corridor aimed at improving connectivity and trade among the three regions.  While energy security is an important aspect, the focus is broader than just energy.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the IMEC could indirectly benefit the EU’s energy diversification efforts, the initiative's primary drivers are not solely the EU.  India also has a significant role in shaping the IMEC's development and objectives.  The misattribution of the primary driving force is a crucial distractor in this question.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 marks the organization's expansion to include ten member states, significantly bolstering its geopolitical influence in Central Asia and beyond.
2. The SCO's primary focus is on counter-terrorism, with its activities primarily concentrated in combating extremism and separatist movements within its member states' territories.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus's entry in 2024 did increase the SCO's membership to ten.  The geopolitical implications of this expansion are significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While counter-terrorism is a crucial aspect of the SCO's agenda, it's not the *primary* focus.  The SCO's scope encompasses economic cooperation, security, and cultural exchanges, among other areas. The overemphasis on counter-terrorism as the primary function is a designed distractor.


**7. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s programs, consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), established in 1996, monitors and reports incidents of illicit nuclear material trafficking globally, providing crucial information for nuclear security efforts.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear technologies to enhance agricultural productivity and improve food security in developing countries, focusing on crop improvement and pest control techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The ITDB's establishment year is 1995, not 1996. While the statement correctly describes the ITDB's function, the incorrect year acts as a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Atoms4Food program accurately described uses nuclear techniques for agricultural improvements and food security enhancement.


**8. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), consider the following statements:**

1. Launched by India in 2018 at the East Asia Summit in Singapore, the IPOI seeks to foster cooperation among countries in the Indo-Pacific region to address shared maritime challenges and promote sustainable ocean governance.
2. The IPOI's philosophy is based on India's "Security and Growth for All in the Region" (SAGAR) initiative, emphasizing the principles of inclusivity, transparency, and respect for international law in maritime affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The IPOI was launched in 2019 in Bangkok, not in 2018 in Singapore.  The incorrect year and location are designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPOI's foundation in the SAGAR initiative and its emphasis on inclusivity, transparency, and adherence to international maritime law are accurate.


**9. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The TEPA, signed in 2023, establishes a free trade area between India and the four EFTA states (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), aiming to significantly boost bilateral trade and investment flows.
2.  Unlike the European Union, EFTA is a customs union, meaning that the member states have a common external tariff policy towards countries outside the association, simplifying trade procedures under the TEPA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While a TEPA is under negotiation, it hasn't been signed as of the current knowledge. The timeline is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. EFTA is *not* a customs union.  This is a crucial point of difference from the EU. The incorrect description of EFTA's structure is a significant distractor.


**10. With reference to the Group of 7 (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates on a rotating presidency system, with each member state holding the presidency for one year, setting the agenda for the group's activities during that period.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2021, is a G7 initiative aimed at mobilizing private sector investment in infrastructure projects in developing countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The rotating presidency system is a key feature of the G7's organizational structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021.  The incorrect year serves as a distractor.


**1. With reference to the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), consider the following statements:**

1. BCBPI, also known as BRICS Pay, is a blockchain-based payment system designed to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border transactions among BRICS nations.
2.  The initiative aims to reduce reliance on existing international payment systems like SWIFT and promote financial autonomy within the BRICS group.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately reflect the core objectives and functionalities of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI).  Statement 1 correctly identifies BCBPI's nature as a blockchain-based system aiming for efficient and cost-effective cross-border payments within the BRICS nations.  The use of blockchain technology is intended to streamline the transaction process, reducing delays and associated costs compared to traditional systems. Statement 2 is also correct, as the BCBPI directly challenges the dominance of systems like SWIFT, providing an alternative for BRICS members and reducing their dependence on Western-controlled financial infrastructure. This aligns with the broader goal of enhancing financial independence and cooperation among BRICS nations.  The initiative therefore serves as a significant step toward creating a more multipolar global financial system.


**2. With reference to the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), consider the following statements:**

1. The ARF was established in 1994 with India joining as a Dialogue Partner in 1996, and it comprises 27 member states, including all ten ASEAN member states and ten ASEAN Dialogue Partners.
2.  The ARF's primary focus is on fostering economic cooperation and trade agreements among its member states, with a secondary emphasis on addressing political and security issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the ARF's formation, India's participation, and its membership structure.  The ARF was indeed established in 1994, with India joining in 1996 as a Dialogue Partner. The statement accurately reflects the total number of member states and the composition including ASEAN members and Dialogue Partners.  Statement 2, however, misrepresents the ARF's primary focus. While economic cooperation is a part of the broader ASEAN agenda, the ARF itself prioritizes political and security issues. Its main objective is to provide a platform for dialogue and cooperation on matters of regional security and stability among ASEAN member states and their partners.  Therefore, the primary focus is not economic cooperation and trade, as stated.


**3. With reference to the East Asia Summit (EAS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The EAS, established in 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is a leaders-led forum primarily focused on discussing environmental issues and promoting sustainable development practices in the East Asia region.
2.  The EAS comprises 18 members: the ten ASEAN member states plus Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the United States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the membership of the EAS. The summit does indeed include the ten ASEAN members plus the eight other nations listed.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect in its characterization of the EAS's primary focus. While environmental issues and sustainable development are important aspects of the EAS agenda, it is not the primary focus.  The EAS is a broader leaders-led forum for discussing strategic, political, and economic issues of importance to the region.  The scope of discussions encompasses a wide range of topics beyond just environmental concerns, including security, trade, and regional cooperation.


**4. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), consider the following statements:**

1.  Launched by India in 2019 at the East Asia Summit in Bangkok, Thailand, the IPOI is a treaty-based agreement that legally obligates participating countries to specific actions regarding maritime security and environmental protection in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. The IPOI's philosophy is rooted in India's 'Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)' initiative, emphasizing inclusive development by combining economic assistance and maritime security concerns while adhering to international maritime laws and norms.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly explains the core philosophy of the IPOI and its connection to the SAGAR initiative. The IPOI does indeed build on SAGAR's principles of inclusive development, combining economic and security aspects while respecting international law.  Statement 1, however, is incorrect. The IPOI is explicitly a *non*-treaty-based, voluntary arrangement.  It does not impose legally binding obligations on participating countries.  The initiative relies on cooperation and shared understanding rather than formal treaty commitments to achieve its objectives.


**5. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  Similar to the European Union, the EFTA is a customs union, meaning member countries share a common external tariff for goods imported from outside the association.
2.  The TEPA aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between India and the four EFTA member states—Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects the purpose of the India-EFTA TEPA. The agreement seeks to enhance trade relations and economic cooperation between India and the four EFTA member states by reducing trade barriers and fostering closer ties.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  Unlike the EU, the EFTA is *not* a customs union.  EFTA member countries maintain their own individual external tariffs for goods imported from outside the association.  This is a key distinction between the two organizations.


**6. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s programs, consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), established in 1995, focuses on monitoring and reporting incidents related to the illicit trafficking of nuclear materials, primarily focusing on the theft of nuclear weapons.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve global food security, particularly focusing on increasing crop yields through the development of genetically modified crops.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements contain inaccuracies. While Statement 1 correctly identifies the ITDB's function in monitoring illicit nuclear trafficking, it incorrectly states its primary focus is on nuclear weapons theft.  The ITDB covers a broader range of incidents involving nuclear and other radioactive materials.  Statement 2 correctly mentions the Atoms4Food program's aim to improve food security, but it's inaccurate in its assertion that the program focuses on genetically modified crops.  Atoms4Food utilizes nuclear techniques in various ways to enhance agriculture, including pest control, crop improvement, and soil management, but not necessarily through genetic modification.


**7. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)'s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments based on five key pillars, and India was ranked among the top three countries globally demonstrating the strongest commitment.
2.  According to the GCI 2024, most countries are categorized as either "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4), indicating a widespread need for improvement in cybersecurity capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately reflects a key finding of the GCI 2024. The report indeed indicates that a significant number of countries fall into the "establishing" or "evolving" tiers, highlighting the global need for enhanced cybersecurity measures.  Statement 1 is incorrect in its claim about India's ranking and the number of top-ranked countries. While India was recognized as a "role model" country (Tier 1),  the statement exaggerates its position and the number of countries in the highest tier.  The report shows a larger number of countries in Tier 1.


**8.  Consider the following statements regarding the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**

1.  Signed in 2009, AITIGA aims to completely eliminate all trade barriers between India and ASEAN member states, creating a fully integrated free trade area.
2.  Recent data indicates that India consistently maintains a significant trade surplus with ASEAN countries due to the success of AITIGA in boosting Indian exports.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect.  While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers, it does not eliminate *all* barriers, and it hasn't resulted in a fully integrated free trade area.  There are still some remaining tariffs and non-tariff barriers affecting trade.  Furthermore, the statement about India maintaining a trade surplus with ASEAN is false.  India actually has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN.


**9. With reference to the SAARC Currency Swap Framework, consider the following statements:**

1.  The SAARC Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) is a mechanism that allows member states to exchange currencies at a fixed rate for a specified period, primarily used to address short-term balance of payments issues.
2.  India's bilateral CSAs with other countries include agreements with Japan, the UAE, and Sri Lanka, but excludes any agreement with BRICS nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes the function of a CSA within the SAARC framework.  CSAs are designed to provide short-term liquidity support to member states facing balance of payments difficulties.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India does have bilateral CSAs with Japan, the UAE, and Sri Lanka, it also has a CSA with BRICS nations as part of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement.


**10. With reference to the India-US defense cooperation, consider the following statements:**

1.  The US designated India as a Major Defense Partner in 2016, leading to the establishment of the 2+2 ministerial dialogue in 2018, and the signing of the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in 2020.
2.  Key military exercises between India and the US include Malabar exercises (involving only India and the US), Cope India (Air Force), and Tiger Triumph (Army, Navy, and Air Force).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 contains chronological errors. While India was designated a Major Defense Partner in 2016, the 2+2 dialogue began in 2018, and LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2020.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. Malabar exercises involve India, the US, Japan, and Australia.


**11.  With reference to the India-Vietnam relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The bilateral relationship between India and Vietnam was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2007 and further strengthened by the establishment of a joint military base in 2016.
2.  Key defense cooperation initiatives between India and Vietnam include the PASSEX, VINBAX, and MILAN exercises, and India's provision of an indigenously built missile corvette, INS Kirpan, to Vietnam in 2023.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly identifies key aspects of defense cooperation between India and Vietnam.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was established in 2016, not 2007, and there is no mention of a joint military base being established.


**12. With reference to the India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Enhanced Strategic Partnership between India and Malaysia, established in 2015, was upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and Malaysia joined the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA) as a founding member.
2.  Malaysia is currently India's largest trading partner in ASEAN, and the two countries have a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) signed in 2010 that has significantly reduced the trade deficit between them.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the recent developments in India-Malaysia relations.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Malaysia is a significant trading partner for India within ASEAN, it is not India's *largest*.  Additionally, the CECA has not eliminated the trade deficit; India still experiences a trade deficit with Malaysia.


**13. With reference to India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCC is currently India's largest trading partner bloc, and India maintains a significant trade surplus with GCC countries due to robust exports of IT services and pharmaceuticals.
2.  Over two-thirds of the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) population resides in GCC countries, contributing significantly to India's remittances, accounting for 30% of total remittances in 2020-21.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the significant presence of NRIs in GCC countries and their contribution to remittances.  Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, India has a trade *deficit*, not a surplus, with GCC countries.


**14. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus recently became the ninth member state to join the SCO, expanding the organization's geographical reach and influence in Central Asia.
2.  At the 24th SCO summit, member states endorsed the "Initiative on World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony, and Development," focusing primarily on promoting economic cooperation and free trade among member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**15. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 operates with a permanent secretariat and a fixed annual budget, ensuring consistent policy implementation and continuity across its rotating presidencies.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, is a G7 initiative aimed at mobilizing private sector investment for infrastructure projects in developing countries, with a strong focus on renewable energy projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the PGII and its objectives.  Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent secretariat and fixed budget; its operations are managed through the rotating presidency, which sets the agenda for each year.



**1. With reference to the IAEA's key programmes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively focuses on nuclear material theft incidents reported by member states since its inception in 1995.
2.  Atoms4NetZero solely concentrates on promoting nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions, excluding other potential applications of nuclear technology in this area.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB does primarily focus on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking, it doesn't exclusively cover nuclear material theft.  The database encompasses a broader range of incidents related to nuclear material security. The timeframe is also not entirely accurate; the database started tracking incidents from 1995, but its scope might have evolved over time.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Atoms4NetZero is indeed a significant IAEA program dedicated to promoting nuclear energy for decarbonization. However, it's not solely focused on this aspect.  The program also likely incorporates research and development efforts into other areas of nuclear technology that could contribute to net-zero emission goals.  The IAEA's approach to sustainability is multifaceted and not limited to a single program.  Atoms4NetZero likely collaborates with other IAEA initiatives to achieve broader environmental sustainability aims.


**2. With reference to the ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments based on a single, overarching criterion.
2.  The “role modelling” countries (Tier 1) demonstrated a weak commitment to at least one of the five cybersecurity pillars.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 uses a multi-faceted approach, assessing countries based on multiple factors and across various cybersecurity domains, not a single criterion.  It's likely to consider various aspects like legal frameworks, technical capabilities, and awareness programs.  A holistic view of cybersecurity is essential, and the GCI reflects this complexity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The "role modelling" countries (Tier 1) are explicitly identified as demonstrating a *strong* commitment to *all* five cybersecurity pillars, not a weak commitment to even one. The Tier 1 classification signifies a high level of achievement in various aspects of cybersecurity.


**3. With reference to Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar, undertaken by the Indian Air Force, primarily targeted Pakistani military installations located in low-altitude areas.
2. Operation Talwar, launched by the Indian Navy, involved a full-scale naval engagement with the Pakistani Navy, resulting in significant losses on both sides.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar targeted Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions in the Kargil region. Low-altitude targets were less strategically relevant in the context of the Kargil conflict, where Pakistani forces occupied high-ground positions.  The air force's actions were carefully planned to maximize effectiveness in the mountainous terrain.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Operation Talwar did involve the Indian Navy's deployment to the Arabian Sea, it was primarily a blockade strategy aimed at preventing Pakistani naval reinforcements, not a direct engagement resulting in significant losses on both sides. The conflict remained largely confined to ground battles and limited air engagements. Direct major naval conflict was avoided.


**4. With reference to the weaponization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly permits the deployment of conventional weapons in space, provided they do not pose a direct threat to Earth.
2.  Militarization of space refers solely to the deployment of weapons in space, excluding any other military use of space-based assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty aims to prevent an arms race in space and prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on celestial bodies, or in outer space. It doesn't permit the deployment of conventional weapons in space, even if they don't pose a direct threat to Earth.  The treaty's goal is to prevent the escalation of conflict into space.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Militarization of space has a broader meaning than just deploying weapons.  It includes the use of space for supporting military operations on Earth, which could involve reconnaissance satellites, GPS systems, and communication networks, without necessarily involving the deployment of weapons in space itself.  The distinction between weaponization and militarization is crucial in understanding the complexities of space security.


**5. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. India's participation in CMF predates the commencement of Operation Crimson Barracuda.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy as part of its CMF participation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India joined the CMF in 2022. Operation Crimson Barracuda, being the first such operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF, implies that India's participation in CMF began in 2022 or later.


Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first operation of this kind conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF. This indicates that it was the inaugural drug seizure operation for India within the CMF framework.


**6. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force before all member states completed its ratification.
2. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is one of the major projects under the BIMSTEC framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

2.  The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to hinder sustainable port infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership aims to combat *cervical* cancer, not solely breast cancer. The focus on cervical cancer reflects the significant global health burden posed by this disease, particularly in the Indo-Pacific region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to *promote* sustainable port infrastructure development, not hinder it.  Sustainable port development is crucial for economic growth and environmental protection in the Indo-Pacific.  The initiative aims to facilitate cooperation and investment in this area.


**8. With reference to the UNODC's reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cocaine as the most abused drug globally.
2. The Golden Triangle, now renamed the Death Triangle, comprises Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, not cocaine.  While cocaine is a significant drug of concern, its global prevalence is lower than that of cannabis.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle) comprises Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand. This region is known for its historical and ongoing involvement in opium production.


**9. With reference to India's measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, was enacted before the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND).
2. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established after the enactment of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, was enacted *before* the establishment of the FIU-IND in 2004. The FIU was created to strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of the PMLA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established much earlier, in 1956, long before the PMLA, 2002, came into effect.  The ED's responsibilities expanded to include enforcement under the PMLA, but its existence predates the act.


**10. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1.  India is not a signatory to the CWC.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, was enacted in India before India became a signatory to the CWC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that India *is* a signatory and party to the CWC.  This is a key aspect of India's commitment to international non-proliferation efforts.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, was enacted *after* India became a signatory to the CWC. The act is a domestic implementation of the international treaty's obligations.  The timeline reflects the process of ratifying international treaties and enacting corresponding national legislation.



**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1992 and in force since 1997, mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles within a predetermined timeframe, irrespective of the signatory nation's economic capacity.
2.  The CWC's verification mechanisms solely rely on self-reporting by member states, with no provision for on-site inspections of chemical facilities or research programs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC aims for the complete destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, the timeframe isn't universally fixed and takes into account the differing capacities of member states. The destruction process is a complex and phased undertaking, often requiring significant financial and technical resources.  The convention provides for flexibility in implementation schedules based on a nation's capabilities.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CWC has robust verification mechanisms far beyond self-reporting.  A crucial aspect is the provision for on-site inspections of declared and undeclared facilities, including stockpiles, production sites, and research programs.  This intrusive verification regime is designed to ensure compliance and deter cheating.  The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), the implementing body, plays a significant role in this verification process.


**2. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country’s effectiveness in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of domestic corruption levels.
2.  India’s MER, first adopted in 2010, is a static document, with no subsequent updates or revisions conducted by the FATF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER comprehensively evaluates a country's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures.  While the focus is on AML/CFT and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the indirect impact of corruption on these areas is implicitly considered.  However, the MER does not include a separate, dedicated assessment of domestic corruption levels.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FATF's MERs are not static documents.  They are subject to periodic reviews and updates as countries implement improvements or deficiencies are identified.  India's MER, initially adopted in 2010, has undergone revisions and further assessments in subsequent years to reflect changes in its AML/CFT framework and effectiveness.


**3. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report identifies cocaine as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by cannabis and opioids.
2. The report highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed the "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a primary region for the cultivation and trafficking of opium.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  According to the UNODC report, cannabis is identified as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy. The ranking of drug abuse varies across regions and depends on factors like availability, cultural norms, and other factors.  Cocaine is significant but not the most abused globally.

Statement 2 is correct. The report correctly identifies the "Golden Triangle" region (renamed "Death Triangle"), which includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a major area for opium production and trafficking.  This region has a long history associated with the cultivation and trade of illicit drugs.


**4. With reference to the Weaponization and Militarization of Space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of any weapons in space, including conventional weapons, and restricts the use of space solely for peaceful purposes.
2. The term "militarization of space" refers to the deployment of weapons systems in outer space to target objects in orbit or on Earth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on celestial bodies, or in outer space. However, it doesn't explicitly ban all weapons in space.  This ambiguity has led to ongoing debates and concerns about the weaponization of space. The treaty focuses on preventing an arms race in space, but the definition of “weapons” remains a subject of interpretation and negotiation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  "Militarization of space" refers to the use of space for military purposes, such as surveillance, communications, navigation, and intelligence gathering. It does *not* necessarily involve the deployment of weapons in space to directly target objects in orbit or on Earth. Weaponization of space is a more specific term referring to the deployment of offensive weapons systems in space.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear weapons material theft and illicit trafficking.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative employs nuclear techniques to improve agricultural practices and enhance food production, but does not involve the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IAEA's ITDB does focus on nuclear material theft and illicit trafficking, it also includes incidents related to other radioactive materials and sources, not just those associated with nuclear weapons. The scope of the database is broader than just nuclear weapons material.

Statement 2 is correct. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative utilizes nuclear and isotopic techniques to improve agricultural practices, enhance crop yields, and improve food quality and safety.  While the initiative employs advanced technologies, it does not inherently involve the use of GMOs.  The focus is on the application of nuclear science and technology in agriculture.


**6. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), responsible for monitoring the implementation of the UN drug control conventions.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term signifies India's sustained commitment to international drug control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INCB is an independent and quasi-judicial body established under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It's not a subsidiary body of the UNODC, although both organizations work towards similar goals in drug control. The INCB has a distinct mandate and operates autonomously.

Statement 2 is correct. The re-election of Jagjit Pavadia to the INCB for a third term demonstrates India's ongoing commitment to international cooperation in drug control and its active participation in global efforts to combat illicit drug trafficking and abuse.  This reflects a consistent policy stance.


**7.  With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions exclusively apply to international armed conflicts and do not extend to non-international armed conflicts (civil wars).
2.  The Additional Protocols of 1977 expanded the scope of the Geneva Conventions to include the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the original 1949 Geneva Conventions primarily focused on international armed conflicts, their application has been extended to non-international armed conflicts through customary international law and subsequent agreements.  The original conventions provided some protection, but this was significantly expanded later.

Statement 2 is correct. The Additional Protocols I and II of 1977 significantly broadened the scope of the Geneva Conventions.  Protocol II specifically addresses the protection of victims in non-international armed conflicts, providing a more comprehensive legal framework for such situations. This expansion was crucial in addressing the humanitarian needs in civil wars and internal conflicts.


**8. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's legal personality, established through the ratification of its charter, grants it the capacity to enter into international agreements and undertake independent actions on behalf of its member states.
2. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity primarily focuses on developing air transport infrastructure within the BIMSTEC region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter in May 2024 conferred legal personality upon the organization. This means BIMSTEC can now operate as an independent legal entity, enter into treaties, agreements, and undertake various actions on behalf of its member states. This enhances its ability to pursue its objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity has a broader scope than just air transport.  It encompasses various modes of transport including road, rail, maritime, and inland waterway transport, aiming to improve regional connectivity and trade facilitation.  Air transport is a component, but not the sole focus.


**9. With reference to the  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in CMF's Combined Task Force-150 demonstrates its commitment to international counter-terrorism efforts, particularly in combating maritime piracy and drug trafficking.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under CMF, focused on countering cyber threats in the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's participation in the CMF, specifically in Combined Task Force-150, signifies its commitment to multilateral cooperation in maritime security. This reflects India's growing global role in combating terrorism, including maritime piracy and drug trafficking in the Indian Ocean region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under the CMF, focused on countering drug trafficking, specifically the seizure of illicit drugs in the Arabian Sea.  It was not related to cyber threats. The operation highlights India's active role in combating transnational organized crime through maritime security.


**10. With reference to Chloropicrin, consider the following statements:**

1. Chloropicrin is a chemical agent exclusively used as a fumigant in agriculture and has no military applications.
2. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chloropicrin as a chemical weapon in armed conflict, but does not regulate its production or stockpiling.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Chloropicrin, while used as a fumigant in agriculture, also has military applications.  It is considered a riot control agent and has been used as a chemical warfare agent due to its irritant properties. Its dual-use nature raises concerns regarding its potential misuse.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of certain asphyxiating, poisonous, or other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare. While chloropicrin falls under the category of chemical agents, the Geneva Protocol's scope is limited to the use in warfare, not the production or stockpiling. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) provides a more comprehensive framework for regulating chemical weapons.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes illicit drug trafficking.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and its legislative frameworks include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly includes the assessment of measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  It is a comprehensive evaluation of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime. While drug trafficking is a significant concern addressed through other international mechanisms, it is not directly a focus of the FATF's core mandate within the MER.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are key legislative pillars in India's AML/CFT framework.  These acts provide the legal basis for prosecuting money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The question tries to mislead by focusing on the year of adoption of the MER, a seemingly less important detail than the core content of the statement.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the least abused drug globally, followed by opioids and amphetamines.
2.  The report identifies the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as regions significantly affected by drug abuse.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report actually highlights cannabis as the *most* abused drug globally, contrary to the statement's claim.  This reversal of the order of drug abuse prevalence is designed to mislead the candidate. Opioids and amphetamines also feature prominently in the report as significantly abused substances.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC reports accurately identify the geographical regions mentioned, noting their renaming to reflect the severity of the drug problem.  The "Golden Triangle" and "Golden Crescent" are notorious for opium and other illicit drug production and trafficking.  The question plays on the familiarity of the original names and the potentially less-known updated names to create confusion.


**3. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1992 and in force since 1997, mandates the destruction of chemical weapons but does not include verification mechanisms to ensure compliance.
2.  Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan are the only four countries that have not ratified the CWC.  India, having ratified the treaty, enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC has robust verification mechanisms in place to ensure member states comply with its provisions. This includes on-site inspections of declared chemical weapons stockpiles, production facilities, and research programs.  The omission of this crucial aspect of the CWC is a deliberate attempt to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The listed countries are indeed the only non-parties to the CWC. India's ratification and subsequent enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrate its commitment to the treaty's objectives. The inclusion of India's actions adds a layer of complexity to the question, testing knowledge beyond just the list of non-signatories.


**4. With reference to international organizations combating transnational organized crime, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, but India has not ratified either.
2. The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network includes India as a member of its steering committee, while the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) excludes India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India *has* ratified the UNTOC (Palermo Convention).  The statement's assertion that India has not ratified either convention is false.  The inclusion of the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, as a supplementary treaty adds a layer of complexity, potentially confusing candidates unfamiliar with the relationship between these two crucial international agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is a member of SAWEN, an important regional initiative to combat wildlife crime. The statement incorrectly claims India's exclusion from SAWEN while correctly stating India's presence on the GlobE steering committee.  This reversal of India’s participation in two relevant organizations is designed to mislead.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with international initiatives:**

1. India's participation in the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) commenced in 2023, leading to Operation Crimson Barracuda, its first drug seizure operation under the CMF.
2. India has a vision to achieve Net Zero Emissions by 2070 and is aiming to increase renewables capacity to 500 GW by 2035, but has not committed to reducing emissions intensity of its GDP.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2023.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed India’s first drug seizure operation under the CMF, but the incorrect year of entry into the CMF makes the whole statement incorrect. The subtle inaccuracy regarding the year of joining is a key element of the question's difficulty.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India *has* committed to reducing the emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% by 2030, not just increasing renewables.  The statement omits this crucial commitment, making it incorrect. The question tests knowledge of India's climate commitments, going beyond just renewable energy targets.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Golden Crescent, primarily encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, is historically and currently a significant region for opium production.  The renaming to "Death Crescent" reflects the high mortality rates associated with drug production and trafficking in the area, and the devastating social and economic consequences.  The region's geopolitical instability further exacerbates the problem.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) is indeed a region with a history of opium production, it's more prominently known for its production of opium and heroin, not primarily cannabis.  The term "Death Triangle" similarly highlights the dangers and deadly consequences associated with drug production and trafficking within this region.  The primary drug produced is not cannabis, but rather opium which is then processed into heroin.  Cannabis production exists, but it's not the defining characteristic of the Golden Triangle's drug trade.

Its role is crucial in monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties, and it assesses states' adherence to these agreements.  It has the authority to make recommendations and rulings regarding international drug control.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Jagjit Pavadia was re-elected to the INCB, his term extends from 2025 to 2030, not until 2025.  The statement misrepresents the duration of his new term.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNTOC (Palermo Convention) is a significant international treaty, its entry into force was in 2000, not 2003.  Furthermore, not all UN member states have ratified the convention.  The statement contains errors regarding both the date of entry into force and the level of ratification.

Statement 2 is correct. The UN Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) does indeed supplement the UNTOC.  UNCAC recognizes that corruption often plays a significant role in facilitating transnational organized crime, and it provides a framework for addressing corruption as a means of combating organized crime more effectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report typically shows cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, not cocaine.  The statement misrepresents the UNODC's findings on drug abuse prevalence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report does address illegal wildlife trade in endangered species, it also covers a broader range of wildlife crime issues, including those related to non-endangered species and various forms of exploitation.  The statement inaccurately limits the report's scope.


**7.  With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITU's GCI assessment encompasses both national-level and private sector contributions to cybersecurity.  The statement inaccurately limits the scope of the GCI's evaluation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The AFSPA (Armed Forces Special Powers Act) grants special powers to the armed forces, but *only* in areas that have been officially declared as "disturbed areas" by the central government.  This crucial aspect highlights the Act's limited geographical scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh has been met with significant opposition and protests from various groups and stakeholders who argue that the Act's powers can lead to human rights abuses.  The statement misrepresents the level of support for the extension.


**11. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  China is currently India's largest trading partner in goods, but this trade relationship is characterized by a significant trade surplus for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While China is indeed India's largest trading partner in goods, the trade relationship is characterized by a significant *trade deficit* for India, not a surplus.  India imports far more from China than it exports.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The LAC (Line of Actual Control) between India and China is *not* formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon in all sectors.  There are ongoing disputes and disagreements regarding the exact location of the LAC, particularly in certain regions.

1. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives aimed to strengthen bilateral relations between India and the Maldives by promoting closer economic ties.
2.  India's "Vaccine Maitri" initiative delivered COVID-19 vaccines to the Maldives, playing a crucial role in supporting its pandemic response.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was a movement advocating for the reduction of Indian influence in the country, not for strengthening bilateral ties.  The statement misrepresents the campaign's objective.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Murray River is Australia's longest river, it doesn't flow entirely within the country's eastern coastal region; its course extends inland.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Great Barrier Reef is located off the northeastern coast of Australia, not the southwestern coast.  The statement misrepresents the reef's location.



**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGII, launched in 2022, aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 to fund infrastructure projects exclusively in Least Developed Countries (LDCs).
2.  The initiative prioritizes sustainable and inclusive infrastructure development, but excludes projects related to fossil fuel-based energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects in developing nations, it doesn't limit its focus solely to Least Developed Countries (LDCs).  The initiative targets a broader range of developing countries to foster economic growth and improve infrastructure across various regions. The funding is intended for a wide spectrum of infrastructure projects, not limited to a specific category of nations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. Although the PGII emphasizes sustainable and inclusive infrastructure, it does not explicitly exclude projects related to fossil fuel-based energy. The initiative's focus is on quality infrastructure that promotes economic development, and while sustainable projects are prioritized, the inclusion or exclusion of fossil fuel projects is not a strict criterion.  The decision on specific projects depends on various factors, including the country's needs and development priorities.  The PGII's comprehensive approach allows for flexibility in project selection.


**2. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list reflects its consistent advocacy for multilateralism and opposition to unilateral sanctions imposed by developed nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's stance on Cuba's inclusion on the US's unilateral terrorism list demonstrates its commitment to principles of non-interference and the upholding of international law.  The movement consistently advocates for a multipolar world order and opposes unilateral actions that undermine international cooperation and norms.  The support for Cuba underscores NAM's solidarity with countries facing unfair or disproportionate sanctions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NAM predominantly includes countries from the Global South, its membership isn't exclusively limited to this group.  Furthermore, NAM's primary focus is not solely on opposing US and Russian influence.  The movement aims to forge independent foreign policies for its member states, pursuing peaceful coexistence and cooperation among nations, irrespective of their geopolitical alignments.  NAM’s position is one of strategic autonomy, not necessarily complete opposition to all major powers.


**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is the largest among all member states, reflecting its significant economic strength and commitment to multilateral cooperation.
2.  The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, solely focuses on promoting gender equality and women's empowerment in Commonwealth nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is the largest member of the Commonwealth in terms of population and a significant contributor, it is not the largest contributor to the Commonwealth's budget. Several other developed nations contribute more financially.  India's influence stems from its population size and economic growth, but not necessarily from the largest financial contribution to the organization.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is broader in scope than solely focusing on gender equality and women's empowerment.  While such initiatives are certainly part of its mandate, the fund supports various development projects across numerous sectors in Commonwealth nations.  The fund's goal is a more comprehensive approach to sustainable development, encompassing a wider range of objectives.


**4. With reference to the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific," published annually by UNESCAP, primarily focuses on macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy recommendations for member states.
2.  UNESCAP's mandate exclusively encompasses economic development, excluding social and environmental issues within the Asia-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific" analyzes macroeconomic indicators, its scope is much broader.  The survey also covers social and environmental factors influencing the region's development. It provides a holistic view, encompassing various aspects that impact the economic and social well-being of the Asia-Pacific region.  The report goes beyond just macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. UNESCAP's mandate explicitly includes social and environmental issues.  The commission addresses a wide range of development challenges in the Asia-Pacific region, integrating economic, social, and environmental dimensions in its policy recommendations and programs. Its integrated approach aims to achieve sustainable development goals within the region, recognizing the interconnectedness of various factors.


**5. With reference to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  UNCTAD's "Trade & Development Report" analyzes trade and development issues with a focus on both developed and developing countries.  While it examines the impact of trade liberalization, it also addresses the challenges faced by developing countries in participating effectively in the global trading system.  The report's objective is to promote equitable and sustainable trade for all nations, not just developed ones.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The DMFAS Programme assists both developing and developed countries in managing their public debt.  The program provides tools and technical assistance to improve debt management practices, regardless of a country's income level.  The program's aim is to strengthen debt management capabilities globally, contributing to fiscal stability and sustainable development.


**6. With reference to the UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN-GSCF's inaugural edition explicitly addressed supply chain disruptions stemming from a combination of factors, including climate change, geopolitical tensions, and interdependencies. The forum recognized the multifaceted nature of these disruptions and the need for a holistic approach to enhance supply chain resilience.  The forum didn't isolate any single cause but rather aimed to deal with the complex interplay of factors.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the manifesto promotes low-carbon and efficient freight transport, it doesn't advocate for a complete elimination of fossil fuel-based transportation. The document emphasizes the transition towards more sustainable practices, acknowledging the need for a phased approach and the realities of current global logistics.  The manifesto promotes a shift towards intermodal transport and other sustainable options, but it does not call for an immediate and complete ban on fossil fuels in the transport sector.


**7. With reference to the G4 nations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The G4 nations – Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan – unanimously support expanding the UN Security Council's permanent membership to include only countries from the Global South.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The G4 nations advocate for UN Security Council reform, but their proposal doesn't exclusively focus on adding only Global South countries as permanent members. Their proposal involves expanding permanent and non-permanent seats, not limiting the expansion to a specific group of nations. The G4's aim is to make the UNSC more representative and effective.

Statement 2 is correct. The UfC group actively opposes the G4's proposal for UN Security Council reform.  The UfC advocates for a different approach to expanding the council's membership, often proposing alternative methods or emphasizing a broader reform package that goes beyond simply adding new permanent members.  The UfC’s opposition reflects differing viewpoints on the optimal way to reform the UN Security Council.


**8. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICC's jurisdiction extends to all crimes committed by individuals, regardless of their nationality or the location of the crime, provided the state involved is a signatory to the Rome Statute.
2.  The ICC's arrest warrants are legally binding on all member states of the United Nations, irrespective of whether they are signatories to the Rome Statute.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ICC's jurisdiction is determined by the Rome Statute, the treaty establishing the court.  While the ICC can investigate and prosecute individuals for serious international crimes, its jurisdiction is limited to states that have ratified the Rome Statute.  The court's power to act depends on the cooperation of member states, and its reach is not universal.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ICC's arrest warrants are only legally binding on states that are parties to the Rome Statute.  UN membership does not automatically confer ICC jurisdiction.  The court relies on the cooperation of its member states to enforce its warrants, and states that haven't ratified the Rome Statute are not obligated to comply.  The legal framework of the ICC is defined by the Rome Statute, not broader UN membership.


**9. With reference to the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NDB's funding primarily focuses on infrastructure projects within BRICS nations, excluding projects in other emerging economies.
2.  The NDB's governance structure ensures equal voting rights for all member states, promoting a more equitable distribution of power compared to traditional international financial institutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the NDB prioritizes infrastructure projects within BRICS nations, its mandate also extends to funding projects in other emerging economies.  The bank aims to support sustainable development and infrastructure development in a broader context, including countries beyond the BRICS group.  The NDB's role is to be a significant player in global development finance.

Statement 2 is correct. The NDB's governance structure is designed to provide equal voting rights to all member states.  This contrasts with traditional international financial institutions where voting power is often disproportionately distributed based on financial contributions.  The equal voting rights aim to ensure a more balanced and equitable decision-making process, reflecting the bank's commitment to inclusivity and equitable representation.


**10. With reference to the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA), consider the following statements:**

1. The BRICS CRA provides short-term liquidity support only to member nations facing balance of payments crises triggered by external shocks, excluding domestic policy failures.
2.  The CRA’s fund size is determined annually by the BRICS summit based on the prevailing global economic conditions and the liquidity needs of member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BRICS CRA offers short-term liquidity support to member nations experiencing balance of payments difficulties. However, the triggering factors are not limited to external shocks; domestic policy failures can also contribute to a nation's eligibility for CRA support. The CRA aims to provide financial stability within the BRICS group, regardless of the specific causes of the balance of payments issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CRA's initial fund size was established at its inception and is not determined annually. The amount is fixed and not subject to yearly adjustments based on fluctuating global conditions or individual member needs.  The fund's size is set to provide a consistent level of liquidity support to member nations.  The mechanism is designed for a relatively stable and predictable support system.



**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGII was launched in 2021 with the primary goal of providing concessional loans to developing nations for infrastructure projects.
2.  The initiative aims to mobilize over $500 billion by 2028, prioritizing projects that align with sustainable development goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021.  While the initiative does support infrastructure projects in developing nations, its focus isn't solely on concessional loans; it aims to mobilize private and public sector investment through various financial mechanisms. The emphasis is on attracting investment, not just providing direct funding.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not 2028,  and a key component is its focus on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure, directly aligning with numerous Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The slight discrepancy in the funding target amount doesn't negate the core accuracy of the statement.  The focus on sustainable development is a critical aspect of the initiative, making this a key point for UPSC aspirants to remember.  The other options are incorrect because they either misrepresent the launch year or the funding target, or both.


**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing maritime trade routes between India and the Middle East, excluding Europe.
2.  The IMEC's development is expected to significantly reduce transportation costs and time for goods traveling between India and Europe via the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC explicitly aims to create a multi-modal transport corridor connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It's not limited to maritime routes and encompasses land and air transportation as well to create a more efficient and interconnected network. The inclusion of Europe is fundamental to the corridor's purpose.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key objective of the IMEC is to improve connectivity and reduce both the time and cost associated with transporting goods between India and Europe. The route through the Middle East is intended to optimize logistics and provide a more efficient alternative to existing routes, thus making this statement factually accurate and relevant to UPSC-style questions on international trade and connectivity.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the scope and objectives of the IMEC.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's primary focus is on military cooperation amongst its member states, with economic cooperation being a secondary concern.
2.  The SCO has a permanent secretariat located in Beijing, China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCO does address security issues, its mandate is broader than just military cooperation. It actively promotes economic cooperation, cultural exchange, and people-to-people contacts among its member states. Economic cooperation is a significant pillar of the SCO's activities, making this statement a significant misconception.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SCO's permanent secretariat is located in Beijing, but this is not the only significant location for the organization's work.  The organization has multiple regional hubs and working groups, and its activities extend beyond the secretariat's location. The question attempts to mislead candidates by focusing on a minor detail (secretariat location) while neglecting the broader organizational structure and functions.  The correct option is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the SCO's priorities and organizational structure.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 Summits are held annually in a fixed location, rotating among the member countries on a pre-determined schedule.
2. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a joint venture between the G7 and the African Union, equally funded by both entities.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 does not have a fixed location for its annual summits. The presidency rotates annually among its members, and each presiding nation chooses the venue for that year's summit.  This makes the statement factually incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is led by the G7, but it doesn't involve equal funding from the G7 and the African Union.  The G7 facilitates access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa, but the funding itself comes from various sources, both public and private, not solely from a 50/50 split between the G7 and the African Union. The question tries to create confusion by implying a specific funding model that doesn't exist.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements present incorrect information regarding the G7's structure and initiatives.


**5.  With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest contributor to the Commonwealth's budget, exceeding all other member states combined.
2. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) is held every five years in a location selected by the Commonwealth Secretariat.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant contributor to the Commonwealth, it is not the largest contributor exceeding all other member states combined. The contribution levels vary, and it's not a fixed percentage or ranking. The statement attempts to create a misconception regarding India's financial contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the CHOGM is a major event, the frequency and location are not dictated solely by the Commonwealth Secretariat. The hosting of CHOGM is decided by consensus amongst member states, and the frequency is not fixed at every five years.  The statement offers a simplified and inaccurate description of the decision-making process and the event's frequency.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies about India's role and the CHOGM's organizational aspects.


**6. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA aims to eliminate all trade barriers between ASEAN member states and India within 10 years of its implementation.
2.  India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN under the AITIGA framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers, but it doesn't aim to eliminate *all* barriers within a specific timeframe.  The process of tariff reduction and trade liberalization is gradual and takes place over an extended period, not within a fixed 10-year timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus, under the AITIGA framework. This means India imports more goods from ASEAN than it exports to the region.  This statement presents a directly opposite fact to reality.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements inaccurately describe the goals and outcome of AITIGA.


**7. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1.  SAARC operates on a weighted voting system, where larger economies have more voting power than smaller ones.
2.  The SAARC Food Bank initiative has been consistently successful in mitigating food insecurity across all SAARC member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. SAARC decisions are taken by consensus, meaning all member states must agree for a decision to be implemented. There's no weighted voting system. The statement tries to introduce a false element of inequality in the decision-making process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SAARC Food Bank has faced challenges in effectively addressing food insecurity across all member states due to various logistical and political factors.  It hasn't been consistently successful in its goals. The statement oversimplifies a complex reality and presents an overly optimistic view of the initiative’s achievements. The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccurate information about SAARC's decision-making and the effectiveness of its initiatives.


**8. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  BIMSTEC's charter grants it the status of an international organization with legal personality under international law.
2.  All BIMSTEC member states have fully ratified the BIMSTEC convention on counter-terrorism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter in May 2024 granted the organization legal personality, signifying its standing under international law. This is a key fact for UPSC-related questions on international organizations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While BIMSTEC addresses security cooperation,  there isn't a universally ratified convention on counter-terrorism applicable to all member states.  Security cooperation is a complex area within BIMSTEC, and the statement oversimplifies the reality of the organization's counter-terrorism efforts. The correct answer is (a) because only statement 1 accurately reflects the status of BIMSTEC after the charter's ratification.



**9. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The Quad's "Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)" is solely focused on providing naval training to member states' navies.
2.  The Wilmington Declaration, adopted at a Quad Leaders' Summit, included a commitment to establishing a permanent Quad military base in the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While MAITRI involves maritime training, its scope extends beyond just naval training.  It aims to enhance maritime domain awareness and cooperation among partner nations, encompassing a wider range of training and capacity-building activities. The statement presents a narrow and inaccurate portrayal of MAITRI's objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Wilmington Declaration did not include a commitment to establishing a permanent Quad military base. The Quad's cooperation focuses on various aspects, including maritime security, but it does not involve establishing permanent military bases. The statement introduces a false element of military escalation.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements misrepresent the scope and aims of Quad initiatives.


**10. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) are conducted every five years for all member countries.
2.  India's MER, adopted in 2010, highlighted significant deficiencies in India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The frequency of FATF's MERs is not fixed at every five years; it varies depending on various factors, including a country's risk profile and the need for follow-up reviews. The statement presents a false sense of regularity in the evaluation process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's 2010 MER did provide an assessment, it didn't necessarily highlight *significant* deficiencies. The assessment process involves a detailed review, and the interpretation of the findings can be nuanced.  The statement offers an overly simplistic and potentially misleading characterization of the 2010 MER.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding the FATF's evaluation process and the interpretation of India's MER.


**11. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Report consistently ranks cocaine as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses primarily on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Report consistently ranks cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, not cocaine.  Cocaine features prominently in the report, but it's not the most widely abused substance. The statement attempts to switch the most prevalent drug.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Africa is a significant region affected by wildlife crime, the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, covering various regions and types of wildlife crime. The statement presents a limited and inaccurate view of the report's geographical focus. The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain factual errors regarding the UNODC's reports.


**12. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative primarily focuses on using nuclear technology for enhancing crop yields in developed countries.
2. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks nuclear material theft incidents within IAEA member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative aims to improve global food security, focusing on both developed and developing countries.  Its scope is not limited to developed nations. The statement presents a geographically limited and inaccurate understanding of the initiative's goals.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IAEA's ITDB tracks incidents of nuclear material theft globally, not exclusively within IAEA member states.  The database includes incidents from various countries, regardless of their IAEA membership status. The statement limits the scope of the database unnecessarily. The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies about the IAEA's programs and the scope of its database.


**13. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) solely focuses on assessing the cybersecurity capabilities of governments.
2.  The GCI categorizes countries into tiers based on their overall cybersecurity preparedness, without any specific focus on individual cybersecurity pillars.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITU's GCI assesses the cybersecurity commitments and capabilities of countries, encompassing both government and private sector efforts.  It's not limited to government assessments alone.  The statement presents a narrow perspective on the scope of the index.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCI does categorize countries into tiers based on their overall cybersecurity preparedness, but it also analyzes performance across five specific cybersecurity pillars.  The statement omits this crucial aspect of the index's methodology. The correct answer is (d) because both statements misrepresent the scope and methodology of the ITU's GCI.


**14. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in CMF is limited to providing logistical support and intelligence sharing, not direct operational involvement.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first counter-piracy operation conducted by the Indian Navy as part of its CMF contribution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation in CMF includes direct operational involvement, as demonstrated by Operation Crimson Barracuda, which involved the Indian Navy's active participation in drug seizures. The statement presents a limited view of India's role.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy as part of its CMF contribution, not a counter-piracy operation.  The statement incorrectly identifies the nature of the operation.  The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies about India's role and the nature of Operation Crimson Barracuda within the CMF framework.


**15. With reference to the United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UNPK), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to UNPK is primarily limited to providing financial support, with minimal deployment of military personnel.
2.  The Nobel Peace Prize awarded to UNPK in 1988 was primarily in recognition of its humanitarian efforts in Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is one of the largest contributors of military personnel to UNPK, not just financial support. The statement downplays India's significant military contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While UNPK's humanitarian efforts are significant, the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize recognized its broader contribution to maintaining international peace and security, not solely its work in Africa.  The statement presents an overly narrow focus on the award's rationale. The correct answer is (d) because both statements contain inaccuracies regarding India's role and the reasons behind the Nobel Peace Prize awarded to UNPK.


**1. With reference to international treaties concerning weapons, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention mandates the complete destruction of existing biological weapons stockpiles within a specified timeframe.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention establishes a verification mechanism involving inspections of chemical weapons production facilities and research programs, but not stockpiles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, it doesn't explicitly mandate the complete destruction of existing stockpiles within a set timeframe.  The treaty focuses on prohibiting the weapons, but the destruction process is a complex and ongoing process, varying by nation and the nature of the stockpiles.  The verification mechanisms are also less robust than those in the CWC.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) does indeed have a robust verification mechanism.  This includes inspections of chemical weapons stockpiles, production facilities, and research programs to ensure compliance.  The CWC's verification regime is considered one of the most stringent in international arms control treaties.  The statement incorrectly limits the verification to facilities and research, excluding the crucial aspect of stockpile inspections.


**2. With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and India Post, consider the following statements:**

1. The Department of Posts, India, released commemorative postage stamps to mark the 200th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union.
2. India Post is the world's largest postal network and is celebrating 150 years of its formation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text states that India Post released commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of the UPU, not the 200th.  The statement manipulates the anniversary date to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  While India Post is indeed the world's largest postal network, the text specifies it is celebrating 170 years of its formation, not 150. The alteration of the anniversary year again serves as a distractor designed to test the candidate's precise recall of factual information.


**3. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's charter, adopted during the 4th summit in Sri Lanka, came into force on May 20, 2024, after ratification by all member states.
2. One of BIMSTEC's seven focus areas is disaster management, with the BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX) as a key initiative.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the BIMSTEC charter was signed and adopted during the *5th* summit, not the 4th, in Sri Lanka in 2022.  The date of its coming into force (May 20, 2024) is accurate, but the incorrect summit number makes the entire statement false. This highlights the importance of precise detail recall in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions disaster management as one of BIMSTEC's seven focus areas and cites the BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX) as a related initiative.


**4. With reference to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+), consider the following statements:**

1. OPEC+ is an alliance of oil-producing countries that includes only members of OPEC.
2. OPEC+ recently extended its deep oil output cuts into 2026.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. OPEC+ is explicitly described as an *alliance* that extends beyond the original OPEC members.  The inclusion of non-OPEC countries in the alliance is a crucial aspect of its functioning and influence on global oil markets.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text states that OPEC+ extended its oil output cuts into 2025, not 2026.  This slight alteration in the year demonstrates the importance of accurate factual recall in answering these types of questions.  A seemingly minor detail can lead to an incorrect answer.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported over 200 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses on promoting nuclear energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text mentions that the ITDB reported 168 incidents of nuclear material theft, not "over 200."  This discrepancy, though seemingly small, makes the entire statement false in the context of a UPSC-style question.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text clearly outlines the Atoms4NetZero program's objective as promoting nuclear energy to contribute to net-zero emissions targets.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but not cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the MER does indeed assess measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, the statement incorrectly excludes cybercrime, which although not explicitly mentioned, is a related area often considered in such evaluations.  The subtle omission changes the meaning and makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The text explicitly states that India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2015.  This demonstrates the importance of precise recall of dates and details in answering these questions.


**7. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ICC prosecutor issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister and Hamas leaders in 2024 for crimes against humanity.
2. The ICC’s jurisdiction extends to all crimes committed by individuals, regardless of their nationality or the location where the crime occurred.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text mentions that the ICC prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister and Hamas leaders for crimes against humanity and war crimes.  The timeframe is consistent with the text's information.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ICC can prosecute individuals regardless of their nationality, its jurisdiction is not unlimited. Its jurisdiction is limited to crimes committed within the territory of a state party or by a national of a state party, and only if that state does not genuinely investigate the matter.  The statement presents an oversimplified and inaccurate depiction of the ICC's jurisdiction.  The ICC's jurisdiction is a complex matter with various limitations.


**8.  With reference to the G4 nations and the United Nations Security Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The G4 nations comprise Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, and they advocate for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2. The "Uniting for Consensus" (UfC) group actively supports the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council seats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that the G4 nations—Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan—are advocating for permanent seats on the UN Security Council through text-based negotiations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly identifies the UfC group as *opposing* the G4 nations' request for permanent seats.  The statement directly contradicts the information provided.  This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the relationships between different actors in international relations.


**9.  With reference to BRICS initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The New Development Bank (NDB) is headquartered in Beijing, China.
2. The BRICS Grain Exchange is an initiative primarily focused on promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India considers the Johnson Line as its claim in the Western Sector, China's claim is based on the McDonald Line (and also Macartney-MacDonald Line).  The LAC itself is not formally demarcated and remains a point of contention. The question plays on the nuanced reality of the LAC's undefined nature, creating a distractor by implying a simpler, more definitive boundary.  The Johnson Line represents only one aspect of a complex and disputed boundary.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The dispute between India and Nepal over Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani stems from differing interpretations of the origin of the River Kali, which was identified as the boundary in the Treaty of Sagauli (1816).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2007 renewal of the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation did not significantly alter the power dynamics in favor of Bhutan's greater autonomy. While the treaty reaffirmed the commitment to friendship and cooperation, the core principles of the 1949 treaty remained largely unchanged, with India continuing to play a significant role in Bhutan's security and foreign policy.  The treaty renewal primarily focused on strengthening existing ties and adapting the agreement to contemporary realities.  It did not fundamentally shift the balance of power.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2016 India-Bhutan FTA did not lead to a trade surplus for Bhutan.  While the FTA aimed to enhance bilateral trade, India remains Bhutan's largest trading partner, and the balance of trade consistently favors India. This is largely due to Bhutan's reliance on Indian imports and the nature of its export-oriented economy. The FTA facilitated greater trade, but it did not reverse the existing trade imbalance.


**2. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon, providing a clear boundary for both nations.
2. The Galwan Valley clash of 2020, while resulting in casualties on both sides, was not the deadliest border incident between India and China since 1962.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is not formally demarcated and there is no mutually agreed upon definition of the boundary.  Its delineation remains a point of contention between India and China, leading to periodic border disputes.  The lack of a formally agreed-upon boundary contributes to the ongoing tension and necessitates ongoing diplomatic efforts to manage the situation.  Both countries have differing interpretations of where the LAC lies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Galwan Valley clash of 2020 was indeed the deadliest border incident between India and China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.  The violent confrontation resulted in significant casualties on the Indian side, marking a major escalation in the long-standing border dispute.


**3. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PIWTT has facilitated increased inland waterway trade between India and Bangladesh, it has not significantly reduced Bangladesh's reliance on Indian ports for international trade.  Chittagong and Mongla ports remain crucial for Bangladesh's international trade, and the PIWTT primarily complements this existing system, rather than replacing it.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture, indicating that funding is not solely from Indian sources. While India has played a significant role in the project's financing and development, Bangladesh also contributes to the project's funding.  It is a collaborative effort reflecting the shared economic interests of both countries.


**4. With reference to India's relations with the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is the largest among all member nations.
2.  The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, focuses solely on promoting gender equality and women's empowerment within the Commonwealth.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a significant contributor to the Commonwealth, it is not the largest contributor.  Several other nations, particularly larger economies, contribute more substantially to the Commonwealth's budget. India's contribution is substantial, but not the highest.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window, while supporting projects related to gender equality, is not solely focused on this area.  It supports a broader range of development initiatives within the Commonwealth, encompassing various sustainable development goals.  Gender equality is a key component but not the exclusive focus.


**5. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The tripartite agreement between India, Iran, and Afghanistan for the development of Chabahar Port was signed in 2006.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The tripartite agreement for the development of Chabahar Port between India, Iran, and Afghanistan was signed in 2016, not 2006.  The earlier years involved preliminary discussions and negotiations before the formal agreement was finalized in 2016.

Statement 2 is correct.  The strategic importance of Chabahar Port stems from its ability to provide India with a direct sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing the need to transit through Pakistan.  This is particularly important given the often strained relations between India and Pakistan.  The port provides an alternative route, enhancing India's connectivity and regional influence.


**6. With reference to Nepal, consider the following statements:**

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. GlobE network is indeed primarily focused on combating transnational organized crime, including corruption, through international cooperation among law enforcement agencies.  The network facilitates information sharing, joint investigations, and capacity building to effectively address this global challenge.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's election to the steering committee of GlobE demonstrates its commitment to strengthening global anti-corruption efforts.  This reflects India's increasing engagement in international initiatives aimed at promoting good governance and combating financial crime.  The participation underscores India's role on the global stage in combating corruption.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While NAM's call for Cuba's removal highlights its support for Cuba,  it doesn't represent consistent support for *all* communist regimes globally. NAM's core principle is non-alignment, meaning it does not take sides in the Cold War or other major power conflicts. Its support for particular countries is based on individual circumstances rather than ideological alignment.  NAM includes members with diverse political systems.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While NAM encourages economic cooperation among its members, its primary objective is broader than just economic cooperation.  It focuses on promoting peace, independence, and sovereignty, and fostering international cooperation based on the principles of non-interference and mutual respect.  Economic cooperation is a significant aspect but not its sole purpose.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The proposed electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar is intended to improve electricity transmission *within* India, specifically between Bihar and Assam. It's not directly linked to cross-border trade with Nepal, though improved Indian infrastructure could indirectly benefit regional energy flows.  The geographical location of the corridor within India makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborative ventures between India and *Nepal*, not Bhutan.  While India has significant energy cooperation with Bhutan (mentioned in the text with examples such as Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu), these specific projects are related to Nepal.  Confusing the countries involved is a common mistake and a key distractor in this question.


**3.  With reference to India's measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1956.
2. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal was launched in 2022 to enhance international cooperation in combating financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956.  1956 is the year of establishment of a different significant institution, the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), which is also involved in combating financial crimes but is distinct from the FIU-IND.  The incorrect year serves as a plausible distractor, exploiting the proximity of the dates and the similar functions of the two organizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The MLAT Portal launched in 2022 is a key initiative to improve international cooperation in sharing information and pursuing investigations related to money laundering and other financial crimes.  The date and the purpose of the portal are accurately reflected in the statement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2010.  Furthermore, the agreement aims to *reduce*, not eliminate, trade barriers.  The process of tariff reduction and trade liberalization is gradual and ongoing, not an immediate complete removal of all barriers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India experiences a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus. This is due to higher imports from ASEAN countries, particularly in manufactured goods and electronic components, than India's exports to the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner for India, it is not India's largest globally.  The text indicates that Singapore was India's 6th largest trading partner globally in 2023-24.  The ranking of trading partners can fluctuate based on various economic factors.

Statement 2 is correct. "Project Nexus" is a collaborative effort to connect India's UPI with the domestic fast payment systems of several Southeast Asian countries, including Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. This initiative aims to facilitate faster and more efficient cross-border payments.


**5. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's MER was first adopted in 2000, highlighting the country's early commitment to combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. The MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but does not involve peer review by other FATF members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2000.  While India had measures in place to combat money laundering and terrorist financing before 2010, the first formal assessment by the FATF was conducted in that year.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The MER process explicitly involves peer review by other FATF members. This is a crucial aspect of the evaluation, ensuring objectivity and a comparative assessment of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.


**6. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing energy security cooperation between India, Middle Eastern countries, and European nations.
2.  The IMEC initiative aims to create a robust and efficient transportation network, primarily through the development of improved maritime routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  While Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, the statement incorrectly asserts that India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner *globally*.  While India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, other countries likely hold larger shares of Bangladesh's overall trade.

Statement 2 is correct. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports high-speed diesel and kerosene from India to Bangladesh, playing a crucial role in ensuring Bangladesh's energy security.


**9.  With reference to the  Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, consider the following statements:**

2. The India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) aims to increase Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India by $100 billion and create 1 million jobs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that Switzerland is the largest trading partner among EFTA members, but the reason is primarily due to gold imports, rather than Swiss watches and pharmaceuticals.  While Switzerland does export these goods to India, the scale of gold imports significantly outweighs other trade items.

Statement 2 is correct. The TEPA aims to attract $100 billion in FDI and create 1 million jobs in India.  This highlights the potential economic benefits expected from the agreement for India.  The ambitious targets demonstrate the significance India places on the agreement's potential to stimulate economic growth.


**1. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia's recent re-election signifies India's continuous commitment to international drug control efforts, reflecting its robust domestic policies and active participation in global initiatives.
2. The INCB's mandate extends beyond monitoring drug trafficking to encompass the regulation of psychotropic substances and the promotion of evidence-based drug policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB highlights India's sustained engagement in international drug control.  This signifies India's commitment to combating the global drug trade and its dedication to collaborating with international bodies to address this transnational challenge.  India's active role in the INCB demonstrates its recognition of the cross-border nature of drug trafficking and its willingness to contribute expertise and resources to international efforts.

Statement 2 is also correct. The INCB's responsibilities are multifaceted. While drug trafficking is a major focus, the board also plays a crucial role in monitoring the production, distribution, and use of psychotropic substances.  Furthermore, the INCB promotes the development and implementation of evidence-based drug policies, guiding nations towards effective strategies for drug control that are grounded in scientific research and data analysis.  This ensures that international drug control efforts are informed, effective, and tailored to evolving challenges.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Palermo Convention, while primarily addressing transnational organized crime, indirectly supports efforts to combat money laundering through its provisions on criminalization and international cooperation.
2.  The UNTOC's effectiveness hinges solely on the willingness of individual nation-states to implement its provisions effectively, with little recourse for international enforcement if a signatory fails to comply.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The UNTOC (Palermo Convention) directly addresses transnational organized crime, including trafficking in persons, smuggling of migrants, and illicit manufacturing and trafficking of firearms. However,  many forms of organized crime are intrinsically linked to money laundering.  The Convention's provisions on criminalization and international cooperation indirectly aid in combating money laundering by providing a framework for prosecuting related offenses and facilitating information sharing across borders.  This interconnectedness makes the fight against organized crime and money laundering inherently intertwined.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the success of UNTOC relies heavily on the commitment of individual states,  it's not entirely without mechanisms for addressing non-compliance.  While there isn't a direct international enforcement body,  the convention fosters international cooperation, including mutual legal assistance and extradition, which can indirectly pressure states to adhere to its provisions.  Furthermore,  the international community can exert diplomatic pressure and engage in targeted sanctions against states persistently failing to comply.  The UNTOC's effectiveness is therefore not solely dependent on individual state actions.



**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses its capacity to combat only money laundering and terrorist financing, excluding other related financial crimes.
2. The FATF's peer-review process ensures that evaluations are objective and unbiased, eliminating potential political influence on the assessment of a country's compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER goes beyond just money laundering and terrorist financing.  It also assesses a country's measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, a crucial aspect of financial crime prevention. This broader scope reflects the interconnectedness of these various threats and the need for a comprehensive approach to financial crime prevention.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FATF aims for objectivity and impartiality, the peer-review process is not entirely immune to political influences. The fact that member states conduct the evaluations can introduce potential biases, particularly in cases involving countries with significant geopolitical importance or complex relationships with other members.  The process strives for objectivity, but the potential for political dynamics to influence assessments remains a challenge.


**4. With reference to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report focuses exclusively on the global production and trafficking of illicit drugs, neglecting the social and health impacts of drug abuse.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report complements its drug-related work by addressing the illegal trade in endangered species and other wildlife products, highlighting the overlap with organized crime.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Day report is not limited to production and trafficking.  It also analyzes the social and health consequences of drug abuse, including addiction rates, public health challenges, and the impact on crime rates.  The report provides a comprehensive overview of the global drug situation, encompassing both supply and demand sides of the issue.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC's work extends beyond drugs to encompass wildlife crime. The World Wildlife Crime Report explicitly links illegal wildlife trade to organized crime, highlighting the transnational nature of this illicit activity and the need for international cooperation in combating it.  This connection demonstrates the UNODC's broader mandate in tackling various forms of transnational organized crime.

1. India's election to the GlobE steering committee underscores its commitment to combating corruption domestically but does not necessarily indicate a willingness to cooperate internationally on anti-corruption efforts.
2. The GlobE network primarily focuses on enhancing investigative techniques and information sharing among its member states, aiming to strengthen law enforcement capacity in tackling corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**6.  With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC's effectiveness relies entirely on the self-reporting mechanism of states, making it vulnerable to non-compliance by countries that choose not to disclose their chemical weapons stockpiles.
2.  India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrates its commitment to the CWC's principles, but the Act's enforcement mechanisms are weak, and India lacks the capacity to effectively monitor compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC relies on state parties' declarations and inspections, it also includes a robust verification mechanism involving on-site inspections and a comprehensive reporting system.  The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) plays a key role in overseeing compliance, and non-compliance can lead to serious consequences.  The CWC's strength lies in its combination of self-reporting and independent verification.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the effectiveness of any legislation depends on implementation, to claim that India lacks the capacity to monitor compliance is inaccurate.  India has a dedicated organization to implement the CWC and actively participates in OPCW activities.  The claim of weak enforcement mechanisms is an oversimplification of a complex issue.


**7. With reference to the  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, consider the following statements:**

1.  The PMLA primarily focuses on prosecuting individuals involved in money laundering, with limited provisions for seizing and confiscating the proceeds of crime.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) plays a crucial role in gathering and analyzing financial information related to suspected money laundering activities, supporting investigations under the PMLA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The PMLA is not solely focused on prosecution; it also includes provisions for seizing and confiscating the proceeds of crime.  This asset recovery aspect is a critical component of combating money laundering, as it aims to disrupt criminal networks and recover illicit funds.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FIU-IND is a vital component of India's anti-money laundering framework. It acts as the central national agency for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence relating to money laundering and other financial crimes, providing crucial support to law enforcement agencies conducting investigations under the PMLA.  Its role in information gathering and analysis is essential for effective enforcement.


**8. With reference to the  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958, consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants sweeping powers to the armed forces, including the authority to arrest and search premises without warrants, but these powers are subject to judicial review and can be challenged in court.
2. The AFSPA's applicability is limited to areas officially declared as "disturbed areas," and the declaration of such areas is a purely administrative decision with no legislative oversight.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AFSPA does grant extensive powers to the armed forces in disturbed areas, but this is not absolute.  These powers, while broad, are not entirely unfettered.  The actions of the armed forces under AFSPA are subject to legal scrutiny, and individuals can challenge actions taken under the Act through the judicial system.  Judicial review, though often challenging in practice, is a crucial check on the powers granted under AFSPA.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the declaration of a "disturbed area" is an administrative decision, it is not entirely without legislative oversight.  The decision to declare an area disturbed typically involves consideration of security assessments and consultations with relevant authorities, but ultimately, it is subject to political and potentially legislative scrutiny.  Parliamentary oversight mechanisms, while indirect, exist to hold the government accountable for the use of AFSPA.


**9. With reference to the  Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), consider the following statements:**

1. The CDS acts as the principal military advisor to the Ministry of Defence, but lacks operational command over the three service chiefs (Army, Navy, Air Force).

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The CDS serves as the principal military advisor to the Ministry of Defence, providing crucial advice on matters related to all three services. However, a key aspect of the CDS's role is that they do not exercise direct operational command over the individual service chiefs.  The service chiefs maintain their operational autonomy under their respective service Acts.

Statement 2 is correct.  The K. Subrahmanyam Committee's recommendations in 2001 laid the groundwork for the creation of the CDS post.  The establishment of the position in 2019 was a significant step towards greater integration and coordination among the three services, aiming to improve efficiency and effectiveness in India's defence structure.  However, the full extent of integration remains a work in progress.

This ensures that all member states, regardless of size or power, have a voice in the organization's activities.  The consensus approach aims to foster inclusivity and collaboration among diverse nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Head of the Commonwealth is not elected. The Head of the Commonwealth is the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom.  While the Commonwealth itself is a diverse organization of independent nations, the position of Head of the Commonwealth is a hereditary one, reflecting the historical origins of the organization.  The organization's leadership is not determined through a formal election process.


**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1993, mandates the complete elimination of chemical weapons stockpiles by all signatory nations within a specified timeframe.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CWC aims for the complete elimination of chemical weapons, it doesn't mandate a specific, universally applicable timeframe for all signatory nations. The timelines for destruction are negotiated and vary based on individual circumstances and capabilities of each state party.  The destruction process is complex and phased.

Statement 2 is correct. India, as a state party to the CWC, has established a national authority – the designated National Authority – responsible for overseeing the implementation of the convention within its territory.  This authority is tasked with ensuring compliance with the CWC's provisions, including the destruction of chemical weapons and the prevention of their production and use.  Penalties for violations are incorporated into India's domestic legislation related to the CWC.  The process includes inspections and reporting mechanisms to the OPCW.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UPU, founded in 1874, is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations. Its primary function is to ensure the efficient and reliable exchange of postal items across international borders, establishing standards and regulations for international postal services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India Post is a significant player in the global postal network, it does not hold a permanent seat on the UPU's governing council with veto power.  The UPU's structure involves a Congress, Council of Administration, and the Postal Operations Council, with voting rights distributed among member states based on a system that doesn't grant any single nation veto power.  The UPU operates on a principle of consensus decision-making.


**3. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB, headquartered in Beijing, is a multilateral development bank focused exclusively on financing infrastructure projects in Asia.
2. India, a founding member of the AIIB, holds the second-largest voting share in the bank after China, granting it significant influence in decision-making.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AIIB, established in 2016, is headquartered in Beijing, China. Its primary mandate is to finance infrastructure projects within the Asia-Pacific region, contributing to sustainable development and regional connectivity. While its focus is predominantly on Asia, it does not explicitly exclude projects outside the region if they align with its overall objectives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is a founding member and a significant shareholder in the AIIB, it does not hold the second-largest voting share. China holds the largest voting share, reflecting its role as the host nation and largest contributor.  The voting shares are distributed among member countries based on their contributions and other factors, giving China a significant but not absolute controlling influence.  India holds a substantial voting share but not the second-largest.



**4.  With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assess a country's effectiveness in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing but exclude assessment of the country's domestic laws and regulations related to these issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  FATF's MERs are comprehensive evaluations. They not only assess the effectiveness of a country's implementation of measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing but also examine the adequacy of its legal and regulatory frameworks. The assessment considers both the legislative and operational aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's first MER was adopted in 2010, subsequent evaluations have not consistently rated India as fully compliant with all FATF recommendations.  The FATF's evaluation process involves a rigorous peer review, identifying areas where improvements are needed.  India has made significant progress in strengthening its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing regime, but it has not achieved full compliance in all areas across all evaluations.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA grants the armed forces the power to arrest any person without a warrant and conduct searches without warrants, but only in areas declared as "disturbed areas" by the central government.
2. The AFSPA applies uniformly across all states in India, regardless of any specific security concerns or internal conflicts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. AFSPA does grant the armed forces certain special powers in areas declared as "disturbed areas." These powers include the authority to arrest individuals without warrants and conduct searches without warrants. However, the declaration of a "disturbed area" is not solely the prerogative of the central government; it can also be declared by a state governor or the administrator of a union territory, depending on the specific circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA's application is not uniform across all states in India. It is applied only in specific regions deemed to be "disturbed areas" based on the assessment of security threats and internal conflicts.  The Act's application is geographically restricted and subject to periodic reviews and extensions.


**6. With reference to the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 likely focuses on economic cooperation – energy security, trade, and investment – it is highly probable that it also includes elements of defense and security collaboration, given the strategic nature of the India-GCC relationship.  Defense and security cooperation is a significant component of India's engagement with the GCC states.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

It deals with various aspects of crime prevention and criminal justice, encompassing issues such as juvenile justice, prison reform, and the promotion of human rights within the criminal justice system.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GenJust seeks to engage youth, its focus is not limited to vocational training and job placement.  It aims to empower youth to participate actively in crime prevention and criminal justice initiatives, promoting awareness, providing opportunities for engagement in community-based projects, and fostering a sense of responsibility towards justice and safety.  The initiative promotes a broader engagement than just employment-focused solutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Operation Neer provided water, not medical supplies, to the Maldives during a water crisis.

The launch of RuPay cards in the Maldives is intended to enhance financial inclusion by providing an alternative payment system and promoting digital transactions. This initiative aims to modernize the Maldivian financial sector and increase convenience for consumers.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate, making (b) the correct answer.

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint initiative between India and Bangladesh to enhance energy security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bangladesh is a significant trading partner for India in South Asia, the statement about India being Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia is not entirely accurate. The ranking of trading partners can vary depending on the data source and year. Statement 2 is correct. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint energy project between India and Bangladesh. This initiative aims to enhance energy security and cooperation between the two countries, providing electricity to Bangladesh.

**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1. It is the world's largest permanent desert lake and the third largest lake in Africa.
2.  Its primary water source is the Omo River, originating in Tanzania.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Lake Turkana is indeed the largest permanent desert lake in the world. However, it is the fourth largest lake in Africa, not the third.  The ranking of African lakes can vary slightly depending on the measurement criteria used (e.g., surface area versus volume), but  Lake Turkana consistently ranks within the top five. The slight inaccuracy in the statement's ranking doesn't negate its core factual accuracy regarding its status as the world's largest permanent desert lake.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Omo River, which is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana, originates in the Ethiopian Highlands, not in Tanzania.  The Omo River's basin lies entirely within Ethiopia, although its impact is felt in Kenya where the lake is situated.  Confusing the origin of the Omo River with a Tanzanian location is a common geographical misconception.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a dormant stratovolcano located in Kenya, and the highest peak in Africa.
2.  It is considered the world's largest free-standing mountain, formed by tectonic plate collisions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. While Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa and a dormant stratovolcano, it is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. This is a significant geographical error. The statement incorrectly assigns it to a neighboring country, demonstrating a lack of precise geographical knowledge.  Furthermore, referring to it simply as a "dormant stratovolcano" without highlighting its unique status as the largest free-standing mountain in the world is a simplification that misses key information.

Statement 2 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed considered the world's largest free-standing mountain. This means it isn't part of a larger mountain range. Its formation is not directly attributed to tectonic plate collisions in the way some mountain ranges are, but rather to volcanic activity.  The statement is accurate in its description of Kilimanjaro's unique geological characteristic.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. It is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, facilitating trade between India and China.
2.  It significantly reduces the travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, situated in the Kali Valley of Uttarakhand.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The inclusion of Bhutan in the tri-junction is a significant geographical error, highlighting a lack of precision in understanding the geopolitical location of this strategically important pass.  While the pass has implications for trade between India and China, it is also a point of contention between India and Nepal.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass does significantly reduce the travel time for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. Its location provides a shorter and more efficient route compared to alternative paths. The statement correctly identifies the pass's practical utility in facilitating this important pilgrimage.  The mention of its location in the Kali Valley of Uttarakhand further adds to its accuracy.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, serving as a major trade route between Europe and East Africa.
2. India's recent shift in fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope route reflects increased geopolitical instability in the region.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Black Sea. The Black Sea is geographically distinct and has separate maritime routes.  This error is a fundamental misunderstanding of the canal's geographical location and its function within global maritime trade.  The statement also incorrectly states that the Suez Canal serves as a major trade route between Europe and East Africa; while it does connect Europe and Africa, its primary function is to connect Europe and Asia.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's decision to shift its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope route is largely attributed to factors like increased geopolitical uncertainty and concerns about the security of the Suez Canal route. This shift reflects a strategic decision to diversify trade routes and reduce reliance on a single, potentially vulnerable pathway. The statement accurately captures this strategic shift and its underlying geopolitical rationale.


**5. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank headquartered in Beijing, primarily focused on financing infrastructure projects in Asia and Africa.
2.  A recent request by the Union Finance Minister of India urged the AIIB to prioritize providing financial resources to high-income countries to bolster their economic growth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The AIIB is indeed a multilateral development bank headquartered in Beijing. Its primary mandate is to finance infrastructure projects in Asia, with a growing emphasis on expanding its reach to other regions.  The statement accurately reflects the bank's core function and geographical focus.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Union Finance Minister's request to the AIIB emphasized assisting *low-income* countries in accessing financial resources, not high-income countries.  This is a crucial distinction, reflecting the AIIB's developmental focus on bridging the infrastructure gap in less-developed economies.  The statement reverses this crucial aspect of the minister's request, representing a significant factual error.


**6. With reference to the Arab League Summit 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, focusing primarily on regional security issues.
2.  A significant outcome of the summit was a renewed commitment to fostering economic cooperation among member states, including initiatives for infrastructure development.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. This represents a factual error concerning the summit's location. While regional security is always a significant concern for the Arab League, the statement's assertion that it was the *primary* focus is an oversimplification.  The summit's agenda typically encompasses a broader range of topics, including economic and social issues.

Statement 2 is correct. Economic cooperation and infrastructure development were indeed significant themes discussed and addressed at the 2024 Arab League Summit.  The summit typically generates outcomes aimed at strengthening economic ties and collaborative initiatives among member states.  The statement accurately highlights one of the key outcomes of the summit.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Nagorno-Karabakh is indeed known as Artsakh by Armenians and is a landlocked mountainous region, it is officially recognized as part of *Azerbaijan*, not Georgia. This is a critical geographical and political error.  Confusing the geopolitical status of Nagorno-Karabakh with Georgia demonstrates a lack of understanding of the region's complex history and current political dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct.  Azerbaijan did regain control of disputed territories in Nagorno-Karabakh from Armenian separatists following recent conflicts.  This led to the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers, signifying a significant shift in the region's power dynamics and the end of a long period of conflict.  The statement correctly reflects this major event.


**8. With reference to Ukraine, consider the following statements:**

1. Ukraine shares land borders with Belarus, Russia, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, Poland, and Turkey.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Ukraine does share land borders with Belarus, Russia, Moldova, Romania, Hungary, Slovakia, and Poland, it does *not* share a land border with Turkey.  Turkey is geographically separated from Ukraine by the Black Sea.  This error indicates a lack of precise knowledge of Ukraine's geographical boundaries.

Statement 2 is correct. The Sea of Azov and the Black Sea are indeed located to the south of Ukraine, and Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island) is situated in the Black Sea. This statement accurately describes the geographical location of Ukraine's southern coast and a strategically important island within its maritime territory.


**9. With reference to the Nord Stream pipelines, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nord Stream pipelines are a network of underwater pipelines supplying natural gas from Norway to Germany.
2.  A recent study suggests that a significant amount of methane leaked into the Baltic Sea following damage to the Nord Stream pipelines.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nord Stream pipelines supply natural gas from *Russia*, not Norway, to Germany. This is a crucial error concerning the origin of the gas transported through these pipelines.  Confusing the source country with Norway demonstrates a lack of understanding of the geopolitical context of energy supply routes in Europe.

Statement 2 is correct.  A study did indeed indicate that a significant amount of methane leaked into the Baltic Sea following the damage inflicted upon the Nord Stream pipelines. This environmental consequence is a matter of international concern, highlighting the potential impact of such incidents on marine ecosystems. The statement accurately reflects this environmental consequence.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kursk Region is located in the *central* part of the Eastern European Plain, not the western part.  Furthermore, it borders Ukraine, not Poland. This demonstrates a lack of precision in the geographical location of the region. Confusing its location with a neighboring country highlights the need for more accurate geographical knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kursk Region does include parts of the Dnieper and Don river basins. This accurately reflects a key aspect of the region's hydrography and its connection to major river systems.


**11. With reference to the Gulf of Aden, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gulf of Aden connects the Arabian Sea and the *Red Sea*, not the Mediterranean Sea.  This is a significant geographical error that misrepresents the location and function of this important waterway.  The statement also overstates its importance as a "crucial maritime route" without providing context for its significance in global trade. While it is important, other waterways are arguably more crucial.


Statement 2 is correct.  Concerns regarding maritime security in the Gulf of Aden due to piracy are valid and well-documented.  The statement accurately highlights this ongoing challenge.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Zambia is a landlocked country in Southern Africa; it does not have access to the Indian Ocean or any other ocean. This landlocked status significantly shapes its economic development and trade patterns.  Statement 2 is correct. Zambia shares land borders with the countries listed, forming a complex network of regional relationships. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. Zambia's landlocked nature and its extensive network of land borders are crucial aspects of its geography, affecting its economic and political dynamics.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the purpose of the VOGSS. It is indeed an Indian initiative designed to promote collaboration and dialogue among developing countries in the Global South, emphasizing a more inclusive and equitable global order. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 3rd VOGSS was held virtually, and not all UN member states participated.  The summit focused on specific countries and regions aligning with India's strategic objectives. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. The VOGSS reflects India's growing role in shaping global discussions on development and South-South cooperation.  The virtual format of the summit demonstrates the adaptability of diplomacy in the digital age.


**20. With reference to the definition of the "Global South," consider the following statements:**

1. The Global South is a geographically defined region encompassing all countries located in the Southern Hemisphere.
2. The Global South primarily comprises countries with lower levels of economic development, technological advancement, and social progress compared to the Global North.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Global South is not strictly a geographically defined region. While many countries in the Southern Hemisphere are considered part of the Global South, the concept also includes countries in the Northern Hemisphere that share similar characteristics of lower economic development and social progress.  Statement 2 is correct. The Global South is primarily characterized by lower levels of economic development, technological advancement, and social progress relative to the Global North.  This distinction is based on various socio-economic indicators. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.  The concept of the Global South is not simply geographical but socio-economic, reflecting a historical and ongoing power imbalance in the global system.  The definition acknowledges the complexity of categorizing nations based on development levels and geopolitical positioning.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest mountain in Africa, it is located in Tanzania, not Kenya.  This geographical detail is important for accurate location identification. Statement 2 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano, formed by the accumulation of layers of volcanic materials over time, resulting in its characteristic conical shape. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect.  The correct identification of Mount Kilimanjaro's location and its volcanic nature are essential details for accurate geographical knowledge.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal, not Bhutan.  This is a crucial point of contention in the region. Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass serves as a significant route for Indian pilgrims traveling to the Kailash Mansarovar region, reducing travel time considerably. Options (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass's location and its importance for pilgrimage highlight its geopolitical significance and its role in religious and cultural exchanges.


**25. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, providing a shorter maritime route between Europe and Asia.
2. The Suez Canal is entirely located within the territory of Egypt.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Both statements accurately describe the Suez Canal. Statement 1 correctly identifies its function of connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, significantly shortening the maritime route between Europe and Asia. This makes it a crucial trade route. Statement 2 is also correct; the Suez Canal is entirely located within Egyptian territory, making it a significant asset for the Egyptian economy and a key element of its national identity. Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect.  The Suez Canal's strategic importance as a vital trade route and its location entirely within Egypt are fundamental aspects of its global significance and geopolitical relevance.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybercrime related financial activities.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and its measures to combat money laundering include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, and the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) in 2004.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While the focus is primarily on these three areas,  the assessment implicitly covers aspects related to financial crimes, including those potentially involving cybercrime.  The evaluation considers the overall effectiveness of a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime, which would naturally encompass the impact of cybercrime on these areas.  Excluding cybercrime-related financial activities entirely from the assessment would be a significant omission.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, form the legislative backbone of India's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to relevant authorities, contributing significantly to the country's AML/CFT framework.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 highlighted cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, with cocaine and amphetamines showing a significant decline in usage.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focused primarily on the illegal trafficking of ivory and rhinoceros horn, with minimal attention paid to other wildlife crimes like illegal timber trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally. While the precise order of other drugs might vary slightly from year to year depending on data availability and analysis, opioids consistently rank among the most abused substances. The statement's implication that cocaine and amphetamines showed a significant decline is not explicitly supported by the provided text but is not necessarily contradicted either.  The overall accuracy of the statement regarding the ranking of drugs is sufficient to mark it as correct.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report addresses illegal ivory and rhinoceros horn trafficking, it is inaccurate to suggest this is its sole or primary focus. The reports typically cover a broad range of wildlife crimes, including illegal timber trade, the trafficking of endangered species, and other forms of environmental crime.  The statement's oversimplification and misrepresentation of the report's scope renders it incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7) initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, primarily focusing on infrastructure projects in developed nations to enhance their technological capabilities.
2. The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a G7-led effort aimed at facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa, supplementing existing African Union initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII's goal is to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects, but its primary focus is on developing nations, not developed ones. The initiative explicitly aims to support sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development in these countries, helping them address their developmental challenges.  The statement's misrepresentation of the PGII's target beneficiaries makes it incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is indeed a G7-led effort designed to attract external investment for clean energy projects in Africa. This initiative complements existing efforts by the African Union and other regional organizations, aiming to accelerate the continent's transition to cleaner energy sources and improve energy access.


**4. With reference to the India-ASEAN relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India became a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN in 1996, a Summit-level Partner in 2002, and established a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2012, signifying a gradual deepening of engagement.
2. The ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise and the ASEAN Solidarity Exercise are key military collaborations between India and ASEAN member states, focusing on counter-terrorism and disaster relief.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The chronology of India's engagement with ASEAN is accurately described.  The progression from Dialogue Partner to Summit-level Partner and then to a Strategic Partnership reflects the growing importance of the relationship for both sides.

Statement 2 is also correct.  The ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise and the ASEAN Solidarity Exercise are significant components of the security cooperation between India and ASEAN.  While counter-terrorism and disaster relief are important aspects, the exercises also cover a broader range of maritime security and humanitarian assistance themes.  The statement's focus on these two key areas does not misrepresent the nature of the exercises.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 marked the organization's expansion to ten member states, signifying a shift in geopolitical dynamics within Central Asia and beyond.
2. The SCO's cooperation programs focus exclusively on countering terrorism and extremism, with limited attention given to economic or cultural cooperation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus joining the SCO did indeed increase the membership to ten and represents a notable geopolitical development.  The inclusion of Belarus reflects shifting alliances and power dynamics in the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While counter-terrorism and extremism are important aspects of the SCO's agenda, it is inaccurate to say that these are the *exclusive* focus. The SCO engages in a wide range of cooperation activities encompassing economic, cultural, and other areas.  The statement's oversimplification of the SCO's multifaceted agenda makes it incorrect.


**6. With reference to the  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is envisioned as a major infrastructure project, focusing primarily on developing high-speed rail networks connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe, to facilitate faster movement of goods and people.
2. The IMEC is intended to enhance connectivity and trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe, but its feasibility is subject to securing necessary political and financial commitments from participating countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMEC aims to significantly improve connectivity, it's not exclusively focused on high-speed rail. The corridor is conceived as a multi-modal transport system, encompassing various modes of transportation including sea, air, and land routes.  The statement's limitation to high-speed rail is an oversimplification and therefore incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The IMEC's primary goal is to boost connectivity and trade among India, the Middle East, and Europe. However, the successful implementation of such a large-scale project depends on the political will and financial resources of the participating nations, which is a key challenge.


**7. With reference to the  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a quasi-judicial body with the power to impose sanctions on countries that fail to comply with international drug control conventions.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB for a third term signifies India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INCB does not have the authority to impose sanctions. Its role is primarily monitoring and reporting on state compliance with international drug control treaties. It can make recommendations and issue reports highlighting areas of concern, but it lacks the enforcement power to levy sanctions.

Statement 2 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election reflects India's ongoing commitment to international collaboration in drug control.  His continued presence on the INCB provides a platform for India to contribute to global drug control policies and strategies.


**8. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused exclusively on combating transnational organized crime, neglecting other relevant criminal justice issues.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, launched by the CCPCJ, aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice, promoting a more inclusive and participatory approach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating transnational organized crime was a significant focus of the 33rd session, it is inaccurate to suggest it was the *exclusive* focus. The CCPCJ addresses a broader range of criminal justice issues.  The statement's oversimplification of the session's agenda makes it incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The GenJust initiative is designed to actively involve young people in crime prevention and criminal justice reform, reflecting a broader move towards more inclusive and participatory approaches within the criminal justice system.


**9. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. India's election to the steering committee of GlobE signifies its commitment to international cooperation in combating corruption, but this does not necessarily translate into stricter domestic anti-corruption measures.
2.  GlobE's primary focus is on enhancing information sharing and coordination among anti-corruption agencies globally, fostering a more effective response to transnational corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's participation in GlobE's steering committee shows a commitment to international anti-corruption efforts. However, international cooperation does not automatically guarantee stronger domestic anti-corruption measures.  The statement acknowledges this nuanced relationship between international and domestic action.

Statement 2 is also correct.  GlobE's core function is to improve communication and collaboration among anti-corruption agencies worldwide, enabling a more effective and coordinated response to transnational corruption networks.  This focus on information sharing and coordinated action is central to GlobE's mandate.


**10. With reference to India's participation in international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund supports UNOCT's global programs, primarily focusing on countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and countering terrorist travel (CTT).
2. India's participation in the first-ever Joint Ministerial Meeting of the C-10 and L.69 groupings signals its engagement in multilateral diplomacy, but does not necessarily indicate a shift in its stance on specific geopolitical issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's financial contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund directly supports UNOCT's programs designed to combat terrorism financing and terrorist travel. This reflects India's active role in countering terrorism at the international level.

Statement 2 is also correct. Participation in the C-10 and L.69 joint ministerial meeting demonstrates India's involvement in multilateral forums. However, participation in such meetings does not automatically imply a change in India's positions on particular geopolitical matters. The statement accurately reflects the cautious and nuanced nature of India's foreign policy.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions may focus more on specific details than broader conceptual understanding.  The difficulty level aims to be challenging, requiring precise factual recall and analysis.


**1. With reference to India's participation in multilateral peace operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was surpassed only by China.
2.  The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in the Middle East and North Africa region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that India was the *highest* contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.  The statement incorrectly suggests that another country (China) surpassed India's contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East and North Africa. This highlights the importance of precise recall of geographical details relevant to global peacekeeping efforts.  The question uses plausible distractors, as both regions are significant contexts for peacekeeping operations.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) the power to override decisions made by the individual service chiefs (Army, Navy, Air Force) in matters of discipline.
2. An ISO is defined solely as a body of troops under the command of a single service, such as the Army or the Air Force.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act empowers the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with disciplinary powers, it doesn't explicitly state that they can override decisions of individual service chiefs. The Act aims to streamline command within ISOs but doesn't necessarily establish a hierarchical override mechanism.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of an ISO specifically includes troops subject to *any two* of the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957. This explicitly refutes the assertion that an ISO comprises troops from only a single service.  The question tests understanding of the legal framework and the composition of inter-service organizations.


**3. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS is directly responsible for the implementation of all national security policies formulated by the National Security Council (NSC).
2. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), is a sub-committee of the NSCS.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NSCS supports the NSC, but the implementation of policies is not solely its responsibility. It involves various ministries and agencies. The NSCS plays a crucial coordinating role but doesn't directly execute all policies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SPG, while headed by the NSA, is part of the *NSC's* structure, not the NSCS. The NSCS supports the NSC and its various components, including the SPG, but is not the parent body. The question assesses the understanding of the organizational structure of India's national security apparatus.


**4. With reference to Operation Vijay (1999), consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Talwar, a key component of Operation Vijay, involved the Indian Air Force's targeting of Pakistani troop positions in the Kargil region.
2.  The Kargil Review Committee (KRC), established after the war, recommended significant changes to India's military doctrine, including a greater emphasis on offensive capabilities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval operation, aimed at blockading the Pakistani navy in the Arabian Sea, not an air force operation targeting Pakistani troops in Kargil. The question uses incorrect attribution of the operation to a different branch of the military to mislead the examinee.

Statement 2 is correct. The KRC's recommendations included significant changes to India's defence architecture and military doctrine, although the specific emphasis on offensive capabilities might be debated depending on interpretation of the report. The core element of the statement—that the KRC recommended significant changes—is accurate.


**5.  With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and India, consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), adopted by the FATF, assessed the country's effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing as 'largely compliant'.
2. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is the primary legislative framework used by India to address issues related to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the passage does not state that India's MER rating is "largely compliant." The text only mentions that the MER was adopted, not its specific assessment.  The question subtly alters the information to create a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PMLA is crucial for combating money laundering and terrorist financing, it does not primarily address the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  That would fall under different national and international legal frameworks.  The question tests the understanding of the scope of the PMLA.


**6. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identified cocaine as the most widely abused drug globally.
2.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The report highlighted cannabis as the most abused drug, not cocaine. The question uses a common but incorrect assumption to serve as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the report addresses wildlife crime, it's not limited to Africa; it covers global trends and challenges related to wildlife trafficking. The question introduces a limiting geographical constraint that is not supported by the facts.


**7. Consider the following statements about India's military exercises:**

1.  Exercise Tarkash is a joint military exercise between India and the United States focused on counter-terrorism operations.
2.  Exercise Indra is a bilateral naval exercise conducted between India and France.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Exercise Tarkash is described in the text as an Indo-U.S. joint counter-terrorism exercise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Indra is a bilateral exercise between India and Russia, not France. Exercise Varuna is the bilateral naval exercise between India and France. The question involves a subtle swap of exercise names and partner countries to test precise knowledge.


**8. With reference to India's participation in multilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  India participates in the RIMPAC exercise, the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise.
2.  Exercise Desert Flag is a primarily land-based military exercise involving India, the United States, and several European nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly mentions India's participation in RIMPAC, identifying it as the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Exercise Desert Flag is a multilateral air exercise, it does not primarily involve land-based operations, nor does it include the United States and primarily European nations as major participants. The text lists a diverse group of participants including countries from Asia and the Middle East.  The question plays on the terminology and geographic assumptions.


**9. Consider the following statements about international treaties and conventions:**

1.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons but allows for their use in self-defense.
2.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention and the 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court are both legally binding international agreements.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, with no exception for self-defense.  The question introduces a misleading exception to the treaty's provisions.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2023.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed India's first operation after joining, but the year of joining is stated incorrectly in the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While counter-terrorism is a significant component of CMF operations, the force's mandate extends beyond this to encompass a wider range of maritime security issues.  This includes, but is not limited to, counter-piracy, drug interdiction, and other collaborative efforts to maintain stability and security in the maritime domain.  The CMF's activities are multifaceted and address various threats to maritime security.


**4. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA's application is uniformly consistent across all states and union territories of India, regardless of the prevailing security situation.
2.  The extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh signifies a permanent and irreversible decision by the Indian government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AFSPA's application is not uniform across India.  It is implemented in specific regions based on the assessment of the security situation and the need for special powers to maintain order and address security challenges.  The application is reviewed periodically and can be extended or withdrawn depending on the prevailing circumstances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The extension of AFSPA is not a permanent and irreversible decision.  While the government extends the act based on security assessments, it's not a permanent fixture.  The extension is subject to review and can be modified or revoked depending on the evolving security landscape.  The decision is subject to political and social considerations and is not necessarily permanent.


**5. With reference to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, consider the following statements:**

1. Both conventions are universally ratified, with all nations adhering to their provisions without exception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While both conventions have widespread support, they are not universally ratified.  Several countries have not signed or acceded to these agreements, creating gaps in global compliance.  This lack of universal ratification weakens the global effort to eliminate these dangerous weapons.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The conventions are not limited to the use of weapons during armed conflict.  They encompass the entire lifecycle of chemical and biological weapons, prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling, acquisition, retention, and use of these weapons.  The comprehensive nature of these conventions aims to prevent the proliferation of these weapons in any context.


**6. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rome Statute, which established the ICC, grants the court universal jurisdiction over all crimes committed globally regardless of the nationality of the accused or the location of the crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ICC has broad jurisdiction, it's not truly "universal" in the sense that it doesn't automatically apply to all crimes worldwide. Its jurisdiction is triggered by specific conditions, including the state's acceptance of the court's jurisdiction, referrals by the UN Security Council, or situations where the alleged crime occurred on the territory of a state party or the accused is a national of a state party.   There are limitations and exceptions to its jurisdiction.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rome Statute explicitly defines the crimes that fall under the ICC's jurisdiction: war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide, and the crime of aggression (added later).  Other international crimes, like certain forms of corruption or human rights abuses that don't meet the specific definitions within the Rome Statute, are not within its direct purview.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, not the World Bank.  Its role is to coordinate postal policies and services globally, ensuring interoperability and efficiency within the international postal system. The World Bank focuses on economic development and poverty reduction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While both India Post and the UPU celebrated anniversaries around the same time, the anniversaries do not coincide exactly.  India Post observed its 170th anniversary, while the UPU celebrated its 150th anniversary.  While their timelines are related, they don't mark the same anniversary year.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Five Eyes Alliance, while having military implications, is primarily focused on intelligence sharing and cooperation.  Military cooperation is a component, but the core function revolves around intelligence gathering, analysis, and sharing amongst member nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the statement accurately describes Australia's decision, it does not necessarily imply a direct link to enhancing military interoperability within the Five Eyes Alliance.  Australia's decision is a matter of domestic policy, driven by factors such as workforce needs and immigration policies, not solely focused on the dynamics within the Five Eyes agreement.  The connection to the alliance is less direct than suggested.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The WSIS+20 Forum aims to assess progress made since the original WSIS summits but also critically examines future challenges and opportunities in the digital realm.  It's not solely retrospective but also forward-looking, aiming to shape future policies and strategies for a more inclusive and equitable information society.

Statement 2 is correct. India's active participation in the WSIS+20 Forum underscores its commitment to international collaboration on digital issues.  This aligns with India's broader national strategies aimed at promoting digital literacy, infrastructure development, and inclusive access to information and communication technologies.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. OPEC+'s decision to extend oil production cuts is significantly influenced by assessments of global economic conditions and their potential impact on oil demand.  Concerns about slowing economic growth and reduced energy consumption often lead to such decisions to manage supply and stabilize prices.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  OPEC+ remains a significant player in the global energy market, and its decisions regarding oil production directly affect global supply and, consequently, prices.  While energy sources have diversified, oil remains a crucial energy source, and OPEC+'s actions significantly impact the overall energy market dynamics and price stability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy after India joined the CMF in 2022.  This highlights India's active role and contribution to the CMF's operations shortly after becoming a member.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the example cited involves the Arabian Sea,  India's participation in the CMF is not geographically restricted. The CMF's operational area is much broader than just the Arabian Sea.  India's contribution to the CMF extends to broader maritime security efforts across different regions and operational theatres where the CMF operates.  The text only gives one example of Indian participation, not the full extent of India's involvement.


**4. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The AFSPA's application is currently limited to the states of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.
2.  The AFSPA grants the armed forces unrestricted powers to arrest and detain individuals without judicial oversight.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text mentions the extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, it doesn't imply that its application is *limited* to only these states.  The AFSPA's applicability has varied geographically over time and across different regions of India based on security concerns.  The statement presents an oversimplification of the AFSPA's geographical reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The AFSPA does grant the armed forces special powers, but these are not entirely unrestricted.  There are legal provisions and limitations within the Act itself, and the powers granted are subject to certain procedures and regulations.  The statement's assertion of "unrestricted powers" is a significant overstatement. The act provides for some level of judicial oversight and accountability.


**5. With reference to the BIMSTEC Charter, consider the following statements:**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2022, following its signing and adoption at the 5th BIMSTEC summit.
2.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter was the final step required for its entry into force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the BIMSTEC Charter was signed and adopted in 2022, it did not come into force at that time.  The text clearly states that the charter came into effect on May 20, 2024, after all member states completed their ratification process.  The statement mistakenly conflates the signing and adoption with the entry into force.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage explicitly mentions that Nepal's ratification was the final step needed for the BIMSTEC Charter to come into effect. This highlights the importance of unanimous ratification by all member states for the charter's implementation.  This fact demonstrates the legal and political significance of Nepal's action in this multilateral agreement.


**6. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Strengthening the Quad Act" passed by the US House of Representatives mandates specific financial contributions from each Quad member.
2. The Wilmington Declaration included the launch of the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership to combat cervical cancer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage mentions the passage of the "Strengthening the Quad Act" but does not specify any mandatory financial contributions from each member.  The Act likely focuses on broader cooperation and strategic alignment, not necessarily outlining specific financial obligations.  The statement makes an assumption not supported by the provided text.

Statement 2 is correct. The Wilmington Declaration is explicitly mentioned as including the launch of the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focused on combating cervical cancer. This initiative represents a collaborative effort among the Quad nations to address a significant global health challenge.  The statement accurately reflects a key outcome of the summit.


**7. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, signifies its complete withdrawal from the CWC.
2.  The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, but allows for their use in self-defense.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text states that India is a signatory and party to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000. This demonstrates India's commitment to the treaty, not its withdrawal.  The statement misinterprets the meaning of enactment of the domestic legislation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons under almost all circumstances.  While there might be ambiguities or interpretations regarding certain situations, the core principle is a complete ban, not an allowance for self-defense use.  The statement presents a distorted view of the CWC's strict prohibition on chemical weapons.


**8. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's MER assesses its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes cybercrime.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004 as a key institution in India's anti-money laundering efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India's MER assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a significant concern, the MER's focus is on the three areas specifically mentioned.  The statement omits information present in the text, providing an incomplete picture.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions the establishment of the FIU-IND in 2004 as a crucial institution in India's anti-money laundering framework.  This demonstrates a key aspect of India's efforts to combat financial crimes.  The statement accurately reflects a factual detail from the provided information.


**9. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses solely on illegal wildlife trade in the African continent.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately reflects the UNODC's findings, identifying cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by the other substances listed.  This statement correctly summarizes a key finding of the UNODC's report.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 likely addresses illegal wildlife trade in Africa, the scope of the report is not limited to this continent alone.  The report likely covers global trends in wildlife crime, addressing various regions and types of illegal activities.  The statement makes an overly restrictive assumption about the report's coverage.  The text only mentions the report, not its scope.


**10. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's election to the GlobE steering committee signifies its commitment to international cooperation in combating corruption.
2.  The GlobE network exclusively focuses on investigating and prosecuting cases of corruption within member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's election to the GlobE steering committee clearly indicates its commitment to working with other countries to combat corruption, signifying a crucial step in international anti-corruption efforts.  This statement accurately interprets the significance of India's role in the GlobE network.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GlobE network's focus is likely broader than just investigating and prosecuting cases within member nations.  It probably facilitates international cooperation, information sharing, and capacity building across various jurisdictions to combat transnational corruption.  The statement limits the scope of the network's activities, making an unwarranted assumption.  The text only mentions the election, not the scope of the network.


**11. With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Department of Posts, India, recently released commemorative postage stamps to mark the UPU's 200th anniversary.
2.  The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India released commemorative stamps to mark the 150th anniversary of the UPU, not the 200th.  The statement contains a factual error regarding the anniversary being celebrated.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly identifies the UPU as a specialized agency of the United Nations.  This statement accurately reflects the UPU's status within the UN system.  This statement correctly reflects the UPU's position within the UN framework.


**12. With reference to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+), consider the following statements:**

1. OPEC+ recently agreed to extend its deep oil output cuts indefinitely.
2. OPEC+ comprises only countries located in the Middle East and North Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text indicates that OPEC+ agreed to extend its deep oil output cuts into 2025, not indefinitely.  The statement misrepresents the duration of the extended cuts.

Statement 2 is incorrect. OPEC+ includes countries beyond the Middle East and North Africa.  The membership of OPEC+ is broader than the regions specified.  The statement incorrectly limits the geographical representation within OPEC+.  The text only mentions the decision, not the membership.


**13. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB exclusively provides funding for infrastructure projects in high-income countries.
2. The Union Finance Minister of India recently requested the AIIB to aid low-income countries in accessing its financial resources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The AIIB's mandate is to support infrastructure development in a range of countries, including those with lower incomes.  The statement presents a severely limited and inaccurate portrayal of the AIIB's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Union Finance Minister's request to the AIIB to assist low-income countries in accessing financial resources, demonstrating a focus on inclusive development.  This statement accurately reflects a recent development related to the AIIB's operations.


**14.  With reference to the Kargil War and Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Vijay aimed to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants who infiltrated the Siachen Glacier region of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Operation Safed Sagar involved the Indian Navy blockading Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Vijay targeted Pakistani infiltrators in the Kargil district, not the Siachen Glacier.  The statement incorrectly identifies the geographical location of the conflict.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an Indian Air Force operation, not a naval operation. Operation Talwar, mentioned in the text, involved the Indian Navy blockading Pakistan's navy.  The statement incorrectly attributes the operation to the wrong branch of the military.


**15. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly permits the deployment of conventional weapons in space for defensive purposes.
2.  The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolution vetoed by Russia aimed to ban all weapons in space, not just weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on the Moon, or other celestial bodies.  It does not explicitly permit the deployment of conventional weapons, though interpretations of the treaty remain a subject of debate.  The statement presents an inaccurate interpretation of the treaty's provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNSC resolution vetoed by Russia specifically focused on banning WMDs in space, not all weapons.  Russia's veto was partly based on the argument that the resolution did not address other potential space weapons.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the vetoed resolution.


**16. With reference to India's participation in UN peacekeeping operations, consider the following statements:**

1. In 2023, India was the second-largest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces.
2. The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India was the *highest* contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, not the second-largest.  The statement contains a factual error regarding India's ranking.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text indicates that the largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East.  The statement incorrectly identifies the region with the largest deployment.


**17. With reference to the G7 initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects primarily in high-income countries.
2. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a G7-led effort focused on facilitating access to external investment for renewable energy projects in Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects in developing nations, not primarily in high-income countries.  The statement wrongly specifies the target recipient countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative as a G7-led effort focused on facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa.  This statement accurately reflects the initiative's goals and focus.


**18. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list reflects its support for the US foreign policy.
2. The US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" only includes countries that have directly engaged in acts of terrorism against US interests.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAM's call for Cuba's removal reflects its opposition to the US's unilateral sanctions and its support for Cuba, not necessarily support for the US foreign policy.  The statement misinterprets NAM's position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The US's list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" includes countries accused of supporting international terrorism, which may or may not directly involve acts against US interests.  The statement presents an overly narrow definition of the criteria for inclusion on the list.


**19. With reference to India's relations with the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing over 70% of its total population.
2. The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, has a total allocation of $100 million over 5 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India represents nearly 60% of the Commonwealth's population, not over 70%. The statement contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the percentage of the population represented by India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions a $50 million allocation for the Commonwealth Sub-Window, not $100 million. The statement contains a factual error concerning the funding amount.


**20. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act empowers the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) with disciplinary powers but not administrative powers.
2. An ISO is defined solely as a body of troops under the command of a single service (Army, Navy, or Air Force).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act empowers the C-i-C of ISOs with *both* disciplinary and administrative powers, not just disciplinary powers.  The statement omits a key aspect of the Act's provisions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. An ISO is defined as a body of troops that may include personnel from any two or all three services (Army, Navy, Air Force).  The statement incorrectly restricts the composition of an ISO.


**1. With reference to multilateral peace operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023, India's contribution to UN peacekeeping forces was the second highest in terms of military personnel.
2.  The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in East Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India was the *highest*, not second highest, contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.  This highlights the significant role India plays in maintaining global peace and security. The statement attempts to mislead by altering a key detail – the ranking of India's contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not East Asia. This points to the concentration of peacekeeping operations in regions facing significant conflict and instability. The incorrect option uses a geographically plausible but factually wrong region to confuse the candidate.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint naval exercise between India and the United States.
2.  Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise held between India and France.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint *army* exercise between India and the United States, not a naval exercise. The incorrect option subtly changes the branch of the military involved, making it a plausible but ultimately false statement.  This tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the details of these exercises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the *United States*, not France. The incorrect option substitutes one key partner nation for another, testing detailed knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar exercises. The candidate needs to remember the specific partner country for each exercise.


**3. With reference to the India-ASEAN relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1994.
2.  The ASEAN Future Forum was established in 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996, not 1994.  The incorrect date is close to the correct one, making it a difficult distractor. This tests the candidate's precise knowledge of the timeline of India's engagement with ASEAN.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ASEAN Future Forum was proposed in 2023, not 2005. The incorrect date is designed to be plausible, drawing on the candidate's general knowledge of ASEAN's history without requiring precise knowledge of the forum's establishment. This highlights the need for precise recall of dates associated with significant international relations events.


**4. With reference to India's relations with the Maldives, consider the following statements:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in Sri Lanka as part of its economic cooperation with the island nation.
2.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project is the smallest infrastructure project undertaken by India in the Maldives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that India launched the RuPay card in the *Maldives*, not Sri Lanka.  The substitution of a geographically proximate country is a common distractor technique.  The candidate needs to accurately recall the country where the initiative was implemented.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the Greater Male Connectivity Project is the *largest* infrastructure project undertaken by India in the Maldives, not the smallest.  The reversal of a key descriptor (largest vs. smallest) is a classic way to create a challenging distractor. The candidate requires specific knowledge of the project's scale.


**5. With reference to the Kargil War and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Safed Sagar was launched by the Indian Navy to target Pakistani troops.
2.  The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by A.B. Vajpayee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was conducted by the Indian Air Force, not the Indian Navy, to target Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions. The incorrect option confuses the branch of the military involved, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the war's military operations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam, not A.B. Vajpayee (who was the Prime Minister at the time).  The incorrect option substitutes the Prime Minister for the actual chair of the committee, a common distractor technique.  The candidate needs to recall the name of the committee's chair accurately.


**6. With reference to Lake Turkana and Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is located in northern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro is the second highest peak in Africa.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana's location is accurately described in the text as northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  The slight variation in the cardinal direction (northwestern vs. northern) is a subtle distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is the *highest* peak in Africa, not the second highest.  The incorrect statement uses a close but incorrect ranking to test the candidate's precise knowledge of geographical facts.  The candidate must know the superlative (highest) rather than just a comparative ranking.


**7.  With reference to the India-Australia relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between India and Australia was established in 2022.
2.  AUSINDEX is a joint air force exercise between India and Australia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) between India and Australia was established in 2020, not 2022. The incorrect date is designed to be plausible. This tests the candidate's ability to remember precise dates associated with significant bilateral agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AUSINDEX is a joint *maritime* exercise, not an air force exercise. The incorrect option changes the branch of the military involved, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the exercise.  The candidate must remember the specific type of military operation involved in AUSINDEX.


**8. With reference to the TAPI pipeline, consider the following statements:**

1. The TAPI pipeline starts in Iran and ends in India.
2. The TAPI pipeline is approximately 1,500 km long.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The TAPI pipeline starts in Turkmenistan, not Iran, and ends in India. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the pipeline's origin point. A geographically plausible but incorrect origin point is used as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The TAPI pipeline is approximately 1,800 km long, not 1,500 km.  The incorrect length is close to the correct one, creating a challenging distractor. The candidate needs to know the approximate length of the pipeline.


**9. With reference to the Colombo Process and the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC), consider the following statements:**

1.  India recently chaired its second meeting as Chair of the Colombo Process.
2.  Bangladesh is the fourth member to be included in the Colombo Security Conclave.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that India chaired its *first* meeting as Chair of the Colombo Process, not its second. This tests the candidate's precise understanding of the timeline of events.  The use of a slightly altered ordinal number (first vs. second) is a common distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text states that Bangladesh is the *fifth* member included in the Colombo Security Conclave, not the fourth. The incorrect ordinal number is designed to be plausible, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the CSC's membership.


**10. With reference to  India's cross-border electricity trade initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar connects to a city in Bangladesh.
2. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Bhutan.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions an upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam which is in India.  It is designed to be a slightly misleading statement to test the candidate's careful reading.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and *Nepal*, not Bhutan. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific bilateral energy projects. The substitution of a neighboring country is a typical distractor technique.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is located in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is Africa's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  The primary water source for Lake Turkana is the Omo River, originating in Ethiopia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, it's described as the *largest permanent desert and alkaline lake* in the world, not just the largest permanent desert lake in Africa.  The distinction is crucial; its alkaline nature is a significant characteristic.  The phrasing in the statement is therefore misleading.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.  This hydrological connection is a key geographical fact relevant to understanding the lake's ecosystem and the region's water resources.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Option (b) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either misrepresent the lake's classification or fail to accurately reflect its water source.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Tanzania, Africa, and is the highest mountain in the world.
2.  It is characterized by its unique status as the world's largest free-standing mountain, not part of a mountain range, and composed of ash, lava, and rock.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano located in Tanzania and is the highest peak in Africa, it is *not* the highest mountain in the world (that title belongs to Mount Everest). This is a significant factual error that makes the statement incorrect.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Lipulekh Pass is indeed located in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand and does reduce travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, it is situated near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not India, Nepal, and Bhutan. This geographical inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct. The resumption of border trade through the Lipulekh Pass between India and China, following its temporary closure during the COVID-19 pandemic, is a matter of ongoing discussion and advocacy by Indian traders.  This reflects a current geopolitical and economic reality.

Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. Option (b) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because of the geographical error in statement 1.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), adopted in 1993, is a landmark multilateral disarmament treaty aiming to eliminate an entire category of weapons of mass destruction.  Statement 1 is correct because the CWC mandates the destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles by its member states.  While the timeframe is not rigidly fixed and varies based on national circumstances and capabilities, the ultimate goal is complete elimination.  Statement 2 is also correct. The OPCW,  a Nobel Peace Prize-winning organization, has a robust verification regime that includes the power to conduct unannounced inspections of declared and undeclared chemical facilities in member states to ensure compliance with the CWC.  This intrusive inspection mechanism is crucial for the effective implementation of the treaty.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as both statements are factually accurate reflections of the CWC's provisions and the OPCW's mandate. Option (d) is incorrect because both statements are correct.  The CWC and the OPCW's work represent a significant achievement in international arms control and highlight the importance of multilateral cooperation in addressing global security challenges.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations, founded in 1874, and its primary function is to standardize and regulate international postal services. This ensures the efficient and reliable exchange of mail across borders.  Statement 2, however, is partially incorrect. While India Post is indeed the world's largest postal network, the claim that it is a founding member of the UPU is not entirely accurate. While India has been a significant player in the UPU since its inception,  the precise membership details at the very start require further verification.  The significance of the 170th anniversary of India Post is accurate but does not necessarily imply founding membership of the UPU. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely correct. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 2 regarding India's founding membership status within the UPU.  The question tests knowledge of both the UPU's role and India's prominent position in the global postal system.

It aims to fill the infrastructure financing gap and support economic development across the region. Statement 2 is also correct. The AIIB's operational framework gives strong emphasis on environmentally sustainable and socially inclusive development.  The bank integrates environmental and social considerations into its project appraisal and approval processes.  It aims to ensure that its investments contribute to sustainable development goals, reducing negative environmental impacts and promoting social equity.  Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because both statements reflect the AIIB's operational principles and focus. Option (d) is incorrect as both statements are accurate. The AIIB's focus on sustainable and inclusive infrastructure development highlights the growing importance of aligning economic growth with environmental and social goals in international development finance.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Although the US initially expressed concerns about CAATSA implications regarding India's S-400 purchase, the text notes that an amendment was passed to exempt India from sanctions in this specific case. The statement misrepresents the final outcome regarding sanctions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Status of Forces Agreement (SOSA) is legally non-binding. While LEMOA is mentioned as a defense agreement, there's no indication of its legally binding nature.  The statement makes an unsubstantiated claim about the legal status of LEMOA.





**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes measures related to cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and its subsequent reviews have consistently highlighted the country's robust legal framework and effective implementation mechanisms for combating financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The FATF's MER does indeed assess a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However,  while cybercrime is a growing concern and often linked to these financial crimes, it's not explicitly a primary focus of the standard MER process. The MER focuses on the core mandates of the FATF.  Therefore, the statement isn't entirely false but needs clarification to be fully accurate.  The inclusion of "but excludes measures related to cybercrime" is what makes it partially incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, the assertion that subsequent reviews have consistently highlighted robust legal frameworks and effective implementation is an oversimplification.  FATF reviews are rigorous and often identify areas for improvement in various countries, including India.  The reports highlight both strengths and weaknesses, and the narrative of consistent positive assessments is inaccurate.  The process involves peer reviews and recommendations for improvement, indicating an ongoing need for adjustments and enhancements in India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing mechanisms.

**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 identified cocaine as the most abused drug globally, surpassing cannabis in terms of prevalence and impact.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focused primarily on the illegal trade of ivory and rhino horn, neglecting other significant wildlife trafficking issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text clearly states that cannabis is the most abused drug, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The statement incorrectly reverses the order of prevalence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the provided text doesn't detail the specific content of the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 beyond its release, to claim it "neglected other significant wildlife trafficking issues" is an unsupported generalization.  The report likely covers a wide range of wildlife crime, not solely focusing on ivory and rhino horn.  The statement makes an assumption about the report's scope without sufficient evidence.

**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft within the territories of member states, excluding any incidents in non-member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that UNTOC is a broader convention aimed at combating transnational organized crime, not just limited to drug trafficking and human smuggling.  The statement incorrectly narrows the convention's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that India ratified UNTOC and also highlights the existence of domestic legislation like the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) which are directly relevant to addressing issues covered under UNTOC.  The statement falsely claims a lack of implementation of relevant domestic policies.


**5. With reference to the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses countries based on their commitment to five cybersecurity pillars, with India ranked among the lowest-performing nations.

1. The CMF is a coalition of primarily European and North American naval forces, with limited participation from Asian countries.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted by the Indian Navy under the CMF, primarily focused on counter-piracy efforts in the Gulf of Aden.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the text doesn't provide an exhaustive list of CMF members, it mentions India's participation, implying a broader representation than solely European and North American nations.  The statement makes an inaccurate assumption about the CMF's composition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that Operation Crimson Barracuda involved the seizure of drugs in the Arabian Sea.  Counter-piracy was not mentioned as the primary focus. The statement incorrectly describes the operation's main objective.


**7. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces only in areas declared as "disturbed areas" by the state government, requiring the central government's approval.
2.  AFSPA's application has been consistently extended to all the seven northeastern states of India since its enactment.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text doesn't detail the specific conditions for declaring an area as "disturbed" under AFSPA or the exact level of governmental approval needed. The statement is too general and potentially misleading regarding the specific legal procedures.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions that AFSPA's application has been extended to *parts* of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, not all seven northeastern states. The statement incorrectly generalizes the geographical scope of AFSPA's application.

**8.  With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, but allows for the production of limited quantities of chemical agents for peaceful purposes under strict international oversight.
2. India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, ensures complete compliance with all aspects of the CWC, without any reservations or exceptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CWC indeed prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. However, it acknowledges the existence of legitimate uses of certain chemicals for peaceful purposes.  These uses are strictly regulated and subject to stringent verification mechanisms under the CWC framework. The statement accurately reflects this nuanced aspect of the convention.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to comply with the CWC, claiming "complete compliance without any reservations or exceptions" is an overstatement. International treaties often have complexities in their implementation, and it's unlikely that any nation achieves complete compliance without any challenges or nuances in their domestic legal frameworks.  The statement presents an overly simplistic and potentially inaccurate view of the complexities of international treaty implementation.


**9. With reference to the  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions the IMEC as a "cornerstone of global connectivity," suggesting that it likely encompasses both sea and land-based routes to facilitate trade and investment.  The statement incorrectly restricts the corridor's scope to only sea routes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text doesn't mention renewable energy as the IMEC's primary objective.  The corridor's focus is on broader economic cooperation, encompassing trade and investment in various sectors. The statement wrongly attributes a specific focus to the IMEC.


**10. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and collective defense against external threats, with economic cooperation playing a secondary role.
2.  Belarus's recent admission to the SCO significantly expands the organization's geographical reach into Central Asia and strengthens its influence in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the SCO does address security concerns, its mandate is broader than solely military alliances.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is Bhutan's top trade partner, the balance of trade is significantly in India's favor, not Bhutan's.  This reflects Bhutan's dependence on Indian imports and its relatively smaller export base.  Bhutan's economy is heavily reliant on hydropower exports to India, but this doesn't necessarily translate into a trade surplus for Bhutan overall.  The Free Trade Agreement (FTA) signed in 2016 further solidified this economic relationship, but the trade imbalance persists.

Statement 2 is correct. The Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) has a long-standing presence in western Bhutan, providing military training and support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives actually advocated for the *withdrawal* of Indian military personnel, reflecting a shift in political sentiment towards a more independent foreign policy stance.  Understanding the nuances of regional political dynamics is crucial for the UPSC.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. Operation Neer (2014) provided *water* assistance during a crisis, not medical assistance. Vaccine Maitri did indeed supply vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic, but the incorrect description of Operation Neer shows a lack of precise knowledge about India's humanitarian assistance programs in the region.  The UPSC often tests the details of India's foreign policy initiatives.

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border between India and China, with both countries agreeing on its exact location.
2. In the Eastern Sector, China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region, while the LAC largely follows the McMahon Line.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is *not* a formally demarcated border; its precise location is a major point of contention between India and China.  This lack of formal demarcation is a key element in understanding the ongoing border tensions. The UPSC frequently tests the intricacies of the India-China border dispute.

Statement 2 is correct. China's claim on Arunachal Pradesh and the LAC's alignment with the McMahon Line in the Eastern Sector are accurate representations of the situation.

**10. With reference to the Pangong Tso lake, consider the following statements:**

1. Pangong Tso is a freshwater lake situated in the Leh district of Ladakh, and is considered a Ramsar site.
2.  Approximately two-thirds of Pangong Tso lies in India, and one-third in China.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pangong Tso is a *saltwater* lake, not a freshwater lake, and it is *not* considered a Ramsar site. The classification of the lake and its ecological significance are important details often tested in UPSC examinations.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Approximately one-third of Pangong Tso lies in India, and two-thirds in China—the proportions are reversed in the statement.  The precise division of territory is a crucial detail in understanding the India-China border dispute.  The UPSC often tests the precise geographical details of disputed territories.


**1. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1. CAATSA primarily targets countries with significant economic ties to Russia, North Korea, and Iran, imposing sanctions to deter such interactions.
2.  A 2018 amendment to CAATSA completely removed all sanctions related to India's purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. CAATSA's core objective is to penalize countries engaging extensively with Russia, North Korea, and Iran through economic sanctions.  It aims to discourage these relationships, which the US considers detrimental to its national security interests.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the US House of Representatives did pass an amendment in 2018 seeking to exempt India from CAATSA sanctions related to the S-400 purchase, this amendment did not become law.  The US government has maintained the possibility of imposing sanctions under CAATSA related to India's acquisition of the S-400, despite ongoing diplomatic efforts to mitigate the issue. The exemption was proposed to protect the burgeoning strategic partnership between the US and India, but the final decision on sanctions remains at the discretion of the US administration.  Therefore, claiming complete removal of all related sanctions is inaccurate.


**2. With reference to the India-United Kingdom (UK) relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) during a virtual summit held in 2021, signifying a significant deepening of bilateral ties.
2.  The UK's "Indo-Pacific Tilt" strategy is largely incompatible with India's strategic objectives in the region, leading to limited areas of collaboration.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. The 2021 virtual summit marked a significant upgrade in the India-UK relationship, elevating it to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. This upgrade reflects a commitment to broader and deeper cooperation across various sectors, including defense, trade, technology, and culture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UK's "Indo-Pacific Tilt" aligns closely with India's strategic interests in the region.  Both nations share concerns about China's growing influence and the importance of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific.  This shared vision has fostered increased collaboration in areas such as maritime security, defense technology, and economic partnerships.  The alignment of the "Indo-Pacific Tilt" with India's strategic goals is a key pillar of the enhanced bilateral relationship.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and India, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), assessing its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, was first adopted by the FATF in 2010 and has not been updated since.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) is a relatively recent institution, established in 2004, playing a crucial role in combating financial crimes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's MER was initially adopted in 2010, it undergoes periodic reviews and updates.  The FATF regularly assesses member countries' progress and effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, stating that the 2010 report remains the only and most recent assessment is false.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, is a relatively newer institution. It plays a vital role in gathering and disseminating financial intelligence, facilitating investigations, and coordinating with domestic and international agencies in combatting financial crimes.  Its establishment reflects India's commitment to strengthening its regulatory and enforcement mechanisms against illicit financial activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently identifies cannabis as one of the *most* widely abused drugs globally, not the least. Opioids and amphetamines also feature prominently as substances of abuse.  The statement reverses the factual finding of the report.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UNODC reports consistently highlight the "Triple Frontier Area" and the "Golden Triangle" (now often referred to as the "Death Triangle") as regions heavily impacted by drug production and trafficking.  These areas are known for their complex geopolitical situations and porous borders, which facilitate illicit activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus's accession to the SCO marks a significant expansion of the organization's membership.  This reflects the SCO's growing geopolitical influence and its broadening scope of engagement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO does have an economic cooperation dimension, it also prioritizes counter-terrorism, regional security, and addressing transnational organized crime.  The organization has developed various mechanisms and initiatives for addressing these challenges, reflecting the complex security landscape of its member states.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  India's participation in the G7 summit was as a full member, reflecting its growing influence in global governance.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects in developing nations, aligning with sustainable development goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation in the G7 summit was as an invited "Outreach Country," not as a full member.  While India's presence reflects its increasing global prominence, it does not yet hold full membership status in the G7.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGII is a G7 initiative aiming to mobilize substantial funding for infrastructure projects in developing countries.  The initiative emphasizes sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development, aligning with international development goals and promoting economic growth in partner nations.


**8. With reference to the ASEAN-India relations, consider the following statements:**

2.  ASEAN and India collaborate across six priority areas, including environment and energy, education, and finance, demonstrating a broad scope of partnership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AITIGA aimed to reduce trade barriers, but India currently experiences a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus. This indicates that India's imports from ASEAN countries exceed its exports to them.

Statement 2 is correct. The six priority areas of cooperation between ASEAN and India highlight the multifaceted nature of their relationship.  The collaboration spans diverse sectors, reflecting the shared interests and commitment to multilateral engagement.


**9. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft within a limited number of countries, due to data limitations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The 2024 GCI report placed India in Tier 1 ("role-modelling" countries), indicating a strong commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars.  The statement misrepresents India's ranking.

Statement 2 is correct.  The GCI framework utilizes a tiered system to evaluate countries' cybersecurity capabilities.  The "role-modelling" tier signifies a high level of commitment across all assessed areas.  The five pillars provide a comprehensive assessment of a nation's cybersecurity posture.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses primarily on enhancing labor rights and workforce development in regional supply chains.
2.  India's election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council signifies its growing role in shaping regional economic cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IPEF's Supply Chain Council does involve labor rights considerations through the Labor Rights Advisory Board, its primary focus is on strengthening critical supply chains, addressing vulnerabilities, and promoting resilience.  The Labor Rights Advisory Board is a separate body under the IPEF,  working in conjunction with the Supply Chain Council but with a distinct mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election as Vice-Chair demonstrates its increasing influence and engagement in regional economic initiatives within the Indo-Pacific region. This reflects India's strategic objective to foster economic partnerships and enhance its standing in the global economic order. The Vice-Chairmanship provides India with a platform to shape the agenda of the Supply Chain Council and contribute to the overall goals of the IPEF.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 1.


**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is primarily envisioned as a land-based transportation route connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe.
2.  The IMEC's potential impact on global connectivity is expected to be limited due to existing well-established trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IMEC will likely involve land-based components, its design is expected to be multi-modal, utilizing sea, air, and land routes to optimize connectivity and efficiency.  The precise configuration of the corridor is still under development, but it is unlikely to rely solely on a single mode of transportation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMEC is projected to significantly enhance global connectivity by offering alternative and potentially more efficient routes.  Existing trade routes may be congested or have limitations, and the IMEC aims to address these shortcomings by providing a more diverse and robust network, particularly for trade between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  The potential economic benefits and geopolitical implications are significant enough to warrant the considerable effort put into developing the IMEC.  Therefore, both statements are incorrect.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's primary focus is on counter-terrorism efforts, with economic cooperation playing a secondary role.
2.  Belarus's accession to the SCO marks a significant expansion of the organization's geographical reach and influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the SCO engages in various areas of cooperation, including economic matters, its core mandate centers on security and counter-terrorism.  This is reflected in the organization's regular summits and initiatives, such as the Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism.  However, it's important to note that economic cooperation is an increasingly important aspect of the SCO's activities.

Statement 2 is correct. Belarus's inclusion expands the SCO's membership into Eastern Europe, a strategically significant region. This expansion increases the organization's geopolitical influence and provides opportunities for enhanced cooperation across a wider geographical area. The addition of Belarus significantly alters the strategic landscape of the SCO, particularly considering its proximity to the European Union and NATO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the agenda annually. This rotating presidency system ensures that each member state has an opportunity to shape the G7’s priorities and initiatives. However, the lack of a permanent structure can lead to inconsistencies in policy implementation and continuity.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII is designed to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations globally, not exclusively in Africa. Although Africa receives considerable attention as a continent with significant infrastructure needs, the PGII’s scope is broader, aiming to support infrastructure development in various regions of the developing world.  The initiative seeks to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative by offering an alternative model of infrastructure financing.


**5. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat only money laundering.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2024.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  These three areas are interconnected and represent significant threats to global security and financial stability.  The comprehensive assessment provided by the MER helps countries improve their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2024.  The 2010 report was followed by subsequent reviews and updates to assess progress and address any deficiencies in India's AML/CFT framework. The recent adoption of a new MER reflects the ongoing process of evaluating and strengthening a country's efforts to combat financial crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cannabis is the *most* abused drug globally, not the least.  This highlights the widespread use and availability of cannabis across various regions.  The report also details the abuse of other substances, including opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC's reports consistently identify the Golden Triangle (renamed the Death Triangle), encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a major region affected by drug production and trafficking. This region has a long history of opium production, and the UNODC continues to monitor the situation and collaborate with regional governments to combat drug-related activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Charter was signed and adopted in 2022, it did not immediately grant the organization legal personality.  Legal personality came into effect only after all member states completed the ratification process, which concluded in May 2024. This delay underscores the complexities involved in achieving consensus among diverse member states.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While security is a focus area for BIMSTEC, it also prioritizes economic cooperation significantly. The organization is actively involved in promoting trade, investment, and connectivity within the Bay of Bengal region.  The seven focus areas of BIMSTEC encompass a wide range of issues, including trade, environment, security, agriculture, people-to-people contact, science and technology, and connectivity, indicating a balanced approach towards regional cooperation.

2.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement was established in 2007.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  SAARC decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity, not majority voting. This consensus-based approach reflects the organization's commitment to inclusivity and the need to accommodate the diverse interests of its member states.  However, this unanimity requirement has also been a factor contributing to the organization's relative lack of effectiveness.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SAFTA Agreement was established in 2006, not 2007. This agreement aims to promote trade liberalization and economic integration among SAARC member states.  However, the implementation of SAFTA has faced challenges, and its impact has been less transformative than initially envisioned.


**9. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) includes only ASEAN member states.
2.  India has a trade surplus with ASEAN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ARF comprises 27 members, including the ten ASEAN member states and seventeen ASEAN Dialogue Partners. India joined the ARF in 1996, reflecting its commitment to regional security cooperation in Southeast Asia.  The ARF serves as a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This indicates that India imports more goods from ASEAN countries than it exports to them.  This trade imbalance highlights the need for greater efforts to diversify exports and enhance competitiveness in the regional market.


**10. With reference to the India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's smallest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh energy initiative.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives reflected a shift in the country's foreign policy, favoring closer ties with China and expressing opposition to the perceived influence of India.  This campaign presented a significant challenge to India-Maldives relations and required a strategic response to manage the situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Neer provided *water* assistance to the Maldives during a crisis, not medical assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Vaccine Maitri was the initiative that provided vaccines to the Maldives during the pandemic, highlighting the importance of health cooperation in bilateral relations.


**12. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Singapore is India's smallest trading partner in ASEAN.
2.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore resulted in a trade surplus for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Singapore is India's *largest* trading partner in ASEAN, not the smallest. This underscores the strong economic ties and significant trade volumes between the two countries.  The strategic partnership between India and Singapore extends beyond trade and encompasses various sectors, including defense and technology.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CECA between India and Singapore has resulted in a trade *deficit* for India, not a surplus.  India imports more goods from Singapore than it exports. This highlights the need for strategies to balance the trade relationship and enhance export competitiveness.


**13. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) only reports incidents of nuclear material theft from developed countries.
2. Atoms4Food is an IAEA program focused on using nuclear techniques to improve global food security.

2.  A recent survey revealed unexpectedly low fish potential, challenging its role as a significant food source.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. While it's the largest *permanent* desert lake,  the phrasing "world's largest permanent desert lake" might be debated depending on the precise definition of "desert lake." However, the core information about its location and status as a significant desert lake is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that the recent survey revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana. This contradicts the statement, making it false.  The survey's findings highlight a previously underestimated resource, potentially impacting food security in the region.  The question attempts to mislead by inverting the actual finding of the survey.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a stratovolcano located in Kenya and is the highest peak in Africa.
2.  The recent Indian expedition to its Uhuru Peak was the first time the Indian national flag was hoisted there.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano and the highest peak in Africa, its location is specified as Tanzania, not Kenya. This geographical inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect. The question plays on the proximity of Kenya and Tanzania and the prominence of Kilimanjaro as the highest peak in Africa to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The provided text mentions a recent Indian expedition hoisting the national flag on Uhuru Peak, but it does not state that this was the *first* time such an event occurred.  The question uses implied information to create a misleading statement, relying on the reader's lack of precise knowledge of previous expeditions.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan, and facilitates trade between India and Nepal.
2.  The closure of the pass during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The statement incorrectly substitutes Bhutan for Nepal, a common geographical error in the region that serves as a distractor.  It also inaccurately states that the pass facilitates trade between India and Nepal; while it's relevant to trade, the primary focus is on pilgrimage.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that the closure of the Lipulekh Pass during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the travel time and feasibility of the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.  This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal, consider the following statements:**

1.  It connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Black Sea, significantly reducing travel time between Asia and Europe.
2.  India's recent shift in fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route was primarily due to geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the *Red* Sea, not the Black Sea. This is a crucial geographical detail that makes the statement false.  The question attempts to confuse the examinee by substituting the Black Sea, another significant body of water in the region, for the correct answer.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. While the text mentions India shifting its fuel exports to Europe, it does not provide a reason for this shift.  Attributing the shift to geopolitical tensions in the Red Sea is pure speculation and not supported by the provided information. The question creates a plausible but ultimately unsubstantiated reason for the shift to act as a distractor.


**5. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, exemplifying their energy cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia, the statement incorrectly claims that India is Bangladesh's *largest* trade partner in Asia.  The text states that India is Bangladesh's *second* largest trade partner in Asia, making this statement false.  The question subtly alters a key detail to create a misleading option.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant as an example of India-Bangladesh cooperation in the energy sector.  This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.


**6. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1.  An upcoming electricity corridor connecting Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam is part of India-Nepal energy cooperation.
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are examples of India-Bhutan energy collaborations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electricity corridor between Katihar (Bihar) and Bornagar (Assam) is part of *India-Bangladesh*, not India-Nepal, energy cooperation.  The question incorrectly swaps the country partners, a common error that creates a plausible distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are examples of *India-Nepal*, not India-Bhutan, energy collaborations.  Again, the question incorrectly substitutes Bhutan for Nepal, a common geographical error in the region, to create confusion.


**7. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon.
2.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash between India and China since 1962.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text explicitly states that the border between India and China is *not* formally demarcated, and there is no mutually agreed-upon LAC.  This directly contradicts the statement, making it false.  The question plays on the common knowledge of the LAC without emphasizing its lack of formal demarcation.

Statement 2 is correct. The text confirms that the Galwan incident of 2020 was indeed the deadliest border clash between India and China since 1962.  This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.


**8. With reference to the Pangong Tso lake, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a freshwater lake located in the Sikkim region and is a Ramsar site.
2.  A recent report highlights China's construction of a bridge near the lake, raising geopolitical concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pangong Tso is a *saltwater* lake, not a freshwater lake, and it is located in Ladakh, not Sikkim.  Furthermore, it is *not* a Ramsar site.  The question introduces multiple inaccuracies regarding the lake's characteristics to create a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions a report about China constructing a bridge near Pangong Tso, highlighting the geopolitical implications of this activity.  This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.


**9. With reference to India-Nepal relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Nepal's recent decision to introduce a new currency note featuring Indian territories is based on the Treaty of Sagauli (1816).
2.  The Kalapani region is a tri-junction area between India, Nepal, and Pakistan, and is the source of a significant territorial dispute.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Nepal's decision to include disputed territories on a new currency note is directly linked to its interpretation of the Treaty of Sagauli (1816) and the ongoing border dispute with India.  This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kalapani region is a tri-junction area between India, Nepal, and *China (Tibet)*, not Pakistan.  The question incorrectly substitutes Pakistan, another country involved in border disputes with India, to create a misleading statement.


**10. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's "India Out" campaign aimed to strengthen relations with the Maldives by promoting economic development.
2.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project, developed by India, is the Maldives' largest infrastructure project.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign was a *reaction* against Indian influence in the Maldives, driven by pro-China sentiments. It was not an Indian initiative aiming to strengthen ties. The question misrepresents the nature and purpose of the campaign to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that the Greater Male Connectivity Project, developed by India, is the Maldives' largest infrastructure project. This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.


**11. With reference to the countries bordering Iran, consider the following statements:**

1.  Iran shares land boundaries with Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Turkey.
2.  Iran's maritime borders include the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately lists the countries sharing land boundaries with Iran: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and Turkey. This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Iran does share borders with the Persian Gulf, it does *not* share borders with the Arabian Sea. Its maritime borders include the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman. The question substitutes the Arabian Sea for the Gulf of Oman, a common geographical error in the region, to create a misleading option.


**12. With reference to Uzbekistan, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a landlocked country in Central Asia, bordering Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.
2.  A recent initiative saw the inauguration of a high-tech IT laboratory at the Uzbekistani Academy of Sciences.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes Uzbekistan's geographical location and its bordering countries: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan.  This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text mentions the inauguration of a high-tech IT laboratory at the *Academy of Armed Forces*, not the Academy of Sciences.  The question subtly alters the name of the institution to create a plausible but ultimately false statement.


**13. With reference to Thailand, consider the following statements:**

1.  Thailand's recent senate approval of a same-sex marriage bill makes it the first Southeast Asian country to legalize such unions.
2.  Thailand shares land borders with Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Malaysia, and Vietnam.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Thailand's senate approved a same-sex marriage bill, the statement falsely claims it was the first Southeast Asian country to do so.  This requires additional knowledge beyond the provided text and is therefore incorrect. The question uses a plausible assumption to create a misleading statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Thailand shares land borders with Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, and Malaysia, but *not* Vietnam.  Vietnam is separated from Thailand by Laos.  The question adds a plausible, yet incorrect, neighboring country to create a strong distractor.


**14. With reference to the Colombo Process, consider the following statements:**

1.  India recently chaired its first meeting as the Chair of the Colombo Process, focusing on regional maritime security.
2.  The Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) recently included Sri Lanka as its fifth member.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India chaired its first meeting as Chair of the Colombo Process.  While the specific focus isn't explicitly mentioned, the overall context suggests a regional focus, making the statement largely accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) recently included *Bangladesh*, not Sri Lanka, as its fifth member. The question swaps the country, creating a plausible but incorrect statement.


**15. With reference to the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1.  India ranked lower than 160 among 180 countries in the WPFI 2024, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
2.  The theme of the WPFI 2024 was "Press Freedom and Sustainable Development Goals."

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text states that India ranked 159 out of 180 countries, which is indeed lower than 160.  This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The stated theme of the WPFI 2024 was "A Press for the Planet: Journalism in the face of the Environmental Crisis," not "Press Freedom and Sustainable Development Goals." The question uses a related but ultimately different theme to create a misleading option.


**16. With reference to the India-United Kingdom (UK) relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The India-UK relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) during a virtual summit in 2022.
2.  The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) focuses on cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), quantum technology, and renewable energy.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the India-UK relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2021, not 2022.  The question introduces a minor chronological inaccuracy to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is largely correct. The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) focuses on cooperation in areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and quantum technology. While renewable energy might be indirectly related, it's not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus in the provided text.  However, the core information about AI and quantum technology is accurate enough to consider the statement correct.  The question uses the possibility of additional related fields to create a plausible but not fully precise option.


**17. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Union Finance Minister recently urged the AIIB to prioritize providing financial assistance to high-income countries.
2.  The AIIB is a multilateral development bank focused on infrastructure development in Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the Union Finance Minister urged the AIIB to assist *low-income* countries, not high-income countries. The question inverts this key detail to create a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text implicitly describes the AIIB as a multilateral development bank focused on infrastructure development in Asia.  This aligns with the common understanding and purpose of such institutions.


**18. With reference to the Arab League, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Saudi Arabia.
2.  The Arab League is an intergovernmental organization comprising countries in North Africa and the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the 2024 Arab League Summit was held in *Bahrain*, not Saudi Arabia. The question uses a plausible alternative location to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The Arab League is indeed an intergovernmental organization composed of countries in North Africa and the Middle East.  This is common knowledge and aligns with the organization's established role.


**19.  With reference to the Nagorno-Karabakh region, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a landlocked mountainous region officially recognized as part of Armenia.
2.  Recent events have seen Azerbaijan recapture disputed territory from Armenian separatists, leading to a Russian peacekeeping withdrawal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized as part of *Azerbaijan*, not Armenia, although it is predominantly populated by Armenians.  This is a crucial detail that makes the statement false.  The question plays on the complex history and disputed status of the region to create a misleading option.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly describes the recent events: Azerbaijan's recapture of territory and the subsequent withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers. This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.


**20. With reference to the Nord Stream pipelines, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Nord Stream pipelines transport natural gas from Germany to Russia.
2.  A recent study suggests significant methane leakage into the Baltic Sea following damage to the pipelines.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nord Stream pipelines transport natural gas from *Russia* to Germany, not the other way around. This is a crucial detail that makes the statement false.  The question reverses the direction of gas flow to create a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions a study indicating significant methane leakage into the Baltic Sea after explosions damaged the Nord Stream pipelines.  This is a factual statement directly supported by the source material.


**21. With reference to the Kursk region, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located in western Russia, bordering Belarus and Ukraine.
2.  A recent emergency declaration in the Kursk region was related to a major industrial accident.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Kursk region is located in *central*, not western, Russia, bordering Ukraine but not Belarus.  The question introduces an incorrect neighboring country to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  The text mentions an emergency declaration in the Kursk region but does *not* specify the cause.  Attributing it to an industrial accident is speculation and not supported by the provided information. The question creates a plausible but ultimately unsubstantiated reason for the emergency to act as a distractor.


**22. With reference to the South Pars gas field, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located in the Persian Gulf and is one of the world's largest gas fields.
2.  The TAPI pipeline originates from the South Pars gas field and transports natural gas to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text accurately describes the South Pars gas field's location and its status as one of the world's largest gas fields.  This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TAPI pipeline does transport natural gas to India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan, it does *not* originate from the South Pars gas field. The question incorrectly links the pipeline's origin to the South Pars field to create a misleading statement.


**23. With reference to the Path to Peace Summit, consider the following statements:**

1.  The summit was held in Ukraine with the objective of facilitating direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine.
2.  India participated in the summit and signed the joint communiqué advocating for a peaceful resolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The summit was held in *Switzerland*, not Ukraine, with the objective of developing a common understanding of a path towards peace, not directly facilitating negotiations. The question misrepresents the summit's location and objective to create a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is also incorrect. India participated in the summit but *abstained* from signing the joint communiqué, highlighting its neutral stance. The question misrepresents India's position in relation to the final communiqué to create a misleading option.


**24. With reference to MERCOSUR, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bolivia recently became a full member of MERCOSUR, expanding the bloc's geographical reach.
2.  MERCOSUR is a customs union focused primarily on promoting economic integration among South American countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Bolivia became a full member of MERCOSUR.  This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is also correct. MERCOSUR is indeed a customs union primarily focused on economic integration among South American countries.  This is common knowledge and aligns with the organization's established purpose.


**25. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1.  CAATSA is a US law aimed at imposing sanctions on countries engaging in significant transactions with Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
2.  India has been completely exempted from CAATSA sanctions for its purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text accurately describes CAATSA as a US law designed to sanction countries engaging in significant transactions with Iran, North Korea, and Russia. This is a verifiable fact directly supported by the source.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to potentially exempt India from sanctions related to the S-400 purchase, the statement incorrectly claims a *complete* exemption. The text only mentions a potential exemption, not a guaranteed one. The question uses an overstatement to create a misleading option.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybersecurity threats.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and its legislative frameworks include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, but not the  Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.  While cybersecurity is a growing concern related to financial crime, it's not explicitly a core component of the standard MER assessment. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the MER.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The PMLA, 2002, and UAPA, 1967, are key legislative tools in India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing efforts.  FEMA, while relevant to financial regulations, is not directly part of the FATF's primary focus on combating money laundering and terrorist financing as defined by the FATF.  The inclusion of FEMA as a supposedly missing element is a distractor.


**2. With reference to international conventions related to weapons, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, while the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention only bans their use.
2. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but excludes crimes related to environmental destruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Both the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention prohibit not only the use but also the development, production, and stockpiling of the respective weapons. The statement creates a false distinction to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Rome Statute does establish the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. However,  the statement falsely implies that environmental destruction is excluded. While the ICC's jurisdiction is defined,  it doesn't explicitly exclude environmental crimes in all situations; the Rome Statute's scope is broader than the statement suggests.  The inclusion of environmental crimes as an exclusion is a deliberate distractor.


**3. With reference to the UNODC's reports on drug abuse, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, and notes that cannabis legalization is widespread across the globe.
2.  The UNODC's reports highlight the "Death Triangle" (formerly the Golden Triangle) encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the "Death Crescent" (formerly the Golden Crescent) including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as major drug-producing regions, but not South America.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the UNODC correctly identifies cannabis as the most widely abused drug, the statement incorrectly states that cannabis legalization is widespread globally.  Legalization is limited to specific countries and jurisdictions. The overstatement of the extent of legalization serves as a distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC reports do indeed highlight the "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent" as significant drug-producing regions. However, the statement incorrectly excludes South America, which is a major producer and distributor of cocaine and other drugs.  The omission of South America is a key distractor, playing on regional knowledge.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning India's international collaborations on energy:**

1.  India and Bangladesh are collaborating on an electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam, and India and Nepal are jointly developing the Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects.  However, there is no significant cooperation between India and Bhutan in the hydropower sector.
2.  Energy pipelines connecting India to its neighbors include the TAPI pipeline for natural gas, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, and the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline, but exclude any significant pipeline projects with Sri Lanka.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly identifies the India-Bangladesh and India-Nepal energy collaborations. However, it falsely claims that there is no significant cooperation between India and Bhutan in the hydropower sector.  India and Bhutan have a long history of collaboration on hydropower projects, including those mentioned in the original text. The false claim about India-Bhutan cooperation is a major distractor.

Statement 2 is correct in identifying the TAPI, India-Bangladesh Friendship, and Motihari-Amlekhganj pipelines. However, the addition of the false claim about the absence of significant pipeline projects with Sri Lanka serves as a distractor, testing knowledge of regional energy infrastructure.


**5. With reference to India's relations with the Maldives, consider the following statements:**

1.  Following the Maldives president's maiden bilateral state visit to India, both countries adopted a vision for a "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership," and India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives. However, there was no currency swap agreement signed between the two nations.
2.  India's initiatives to strengthen relations with the Maldives include building a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll, providing grants for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs), and developing the Greater Male Connectivity Project. However, India has not provided any significant assistance to the Maldives during any crisis situation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The statement correctly mentions the "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" and the launch of the RuPay card. However, it falsely claims that no currency swap agreement was signed.  A currency swap agreement was, in fact, a key outcome of the visit. The omission of the currency swap agreement is a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement correctly lists India's initiatives in the Maldives. However, it falsely claims that India has provided no significant assistance during crises.  The original text clearly mentions Operation Neer (water assistance) and Vaccine Maitri (COVID-19 vaccine supply) as examples of crisis response.  The denial of crisis assistance is a significant distractor.


**6. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in "disturbed areas," allowing them to open fire, arrest, and search premises without warrants. However, legal proceedings against armed forces personnel can be initiated without prior sanction from the Central Government.
2.  AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh, and also remains in force in Jammu and Kashmir through the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990.  However, the Governor of a state cannot declare a disturbed area.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While AFSPA does grant the powers described, it explicitly requires prior sanction from the Central Government before legal proceedings can be initiated against armed forces personnel.  The statement incorrectly suggests that this sanction is not necessary, acting as a significant distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement correctly identifies the areas where AFSPA is in effect.  However, it falsely claims that the Governor cannot declare a disturbed area. The Governor, or the administrator of a Union Territory, or the central government *can* make such a declaration.  This false claim about the Governor's power is a key distractor.


**7. Consider the following statements about India’s engagement with the US:**

1.  India is the 18th  Strategic Security Partner (SOSA) of the US, and this agreement is legally binding.  Additionally, India and the US have signed the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA), Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA), Industrial Security Agreement, and Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA). However,  India has a trade deficit with the US.
2.  Major milestones in India-US defense cooperation include the designation of India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016, the 2+2 meetings (starting in 2018), the roadmap for defense industrial cooperation (2023), and joint military exercises like Malabar, Cope India, Tiger Triumph, and Yudh Abhyas. However, there is no initiative facilitating partnerships among US and Indian defense companies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts.  First, while India is a major defense partner, it is not the 18th SOSA partner; the number and exact designation may be incorrect. Second, the SOSA agreement (or similar agreements) are *not* legally binding; they are frameworks for cooperation. Third, the statement incorrectly claims India has a trade deficit with the US; the original text indicates a trade *surplus* for India.  These multiple inaccuracies serve as strong distractors.

Statement 2 is largely correct in outlining the milestones in India-US defense cooperation. However, the statement falsely claims that there is no initiative facilitating partnerships between US and Indian defense companies.  The original text mentions INDUS-X, which directly contradicts this claim.  The false claim about the absence of such an initiative is a significant distractor.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybercrimes.
2.  India's first MER was adopted in 2010, and its measures to combat money laundering include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER explicitly assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a significant concern, it's not a primary focus of the FATF's MER.  The scope is specifically defined.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. The statement accurately lists key legislative frameworks (PMLA, UAPA) and institutions (FIU-IND, ED) that form part of India's anti-money laundering strategy.  These are well-established and publicly known components of India's financial regulatory system.  The inclusion of these elements demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of India's approach.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 indicates that opioids are the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle"), encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a major region affected by drug trafficking and wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  According to the UNODC's World Drug Day report, cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids. The order of drug abuse prevalence is a key finding of the report and is easily verifiable.  The statement incorrectly reverses the order of the two most abused drugs.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC report does indeed highlight the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle") region, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, as a significant area affected by drug trafficking and related criminal activities. The report's geographical focus on this region and its new nomenclature are important details.



**3. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, signed in 2022 and came into force in May 2024, grants BIMSTEC the status of an intergovernmental organization but not a legal personality under international law.
2. BIMSTEC's seven focus areas include trade, environment and climate change, security, agriculture and food security, people-to-people contact, science, technology, and innovation, and connectivity,  with a particular emphasis on promoting free trade agreements within the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter, upon ratification by all member states, did grant BIMSTEC a legal personality.  This is a significant development in the organization's evolution, signifying its enhanced standing in international relations. The statement incorrectly asserts that it only achieved intergovernmental status.

Statement 2 is correct. The seven focus areas listed are accurately reflected in the BIMSTEC framework. While the organization aims to foster economic cooperation, the emphasis isn't solely on free trade agreements; it encompasses a broader range of collaborative initiatives across various sectors. The statement correctly identifies the core areas of BIMSTEC's mandate.


**4. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The “Strengthening the Quad Act,” passed by the US House of Representatives, mandates the establishment of a permanent Quad secretariat based in Washington D.C. to manage joint initiatives.
2. The Wilmington Declaration, adopted at the Quad Leaders’ Summit, includes the “Quad Cancer Moonshot” partnership focused on combating cervical cancer and the “Quad Ports of the Future Partnership” to promote sustainable port infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Strengthening the Quad Act" aims to bolster cooperation among Quad members, it does not mandate the creation of a permanent secretariat in Washington D.C.  The Quad's organizational structure is less formalized, relying on existing diplomatic channels and mechanisms for coordination. The statement misrepresents the Act's provisions.

Statement 2 is correct. The Wilmington Declaration did indeed include the initiatives mentioned: the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" and the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership." These partnerships represent concrete examples of the Quad's collaborative efforts in health and infrastructure development.  The statement accurately reflects the content of the Declaration.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. India was elected as the Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council, responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Supply Chain Agreement among the participating countries.
2.  The IPEF’s Supply Chain Agreement established three bodies: the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board, but excludes any mechanism for dispute resolution.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India was elected as the *Vice-Chair*, not the Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council. This subtle but crucial difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall in international relations. The statement misstates India's role within the council.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement did establish the three bodies mentioned: the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board. While dispute resolution mechanisms might be implicit in the framework, they are not explicitly mentioned as a formally established body under the agreement.  The statement correctly identifies the established bodies.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  At the 24th SCO summit in Astana, Kazakhstan, Belarus joined as the 11th member, significantly expanding the organization's geographical reach and influence.
2. The SCO summit endorsed the “Initiative on World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony, and Development,” but did not adopt any concrete action plan or mechanism for its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus became the 10th member, not the 11th, of the SCO at the Astana summit.  The addition of Belarus is a noteworthy development, but the statement misstates the organization's current membership count.  Accurate numerical data is crucial in questions related to international organizations.

Statement 2 is correct. The SCO summit did endorse the initiative on world unity, but as the statement correctly points out, it did not include a detailed action plan or implementation mechanism. This reflects the often-declaratory nature of such initiatives within large international bodies.  The statement accurately portrays the nature of the endorsement.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. India's participation in the 50th G7 Summit in Apulia, Italy, as an outreach country, marked India's first-ever formal membership in the G7.
2. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations, with a particular focus on projects related to renewable energy and sustainable development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's participation in the G7 summit as an outreach country does *not* constitute formal membership. The G7 is a group of seven leading industrialized nations, and outreach participation is a separate mechanism for engaging with other countries on specific issues. The statement incorrectly equates outreach participation with full membership.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGII is a G7 initiative focused on funding infrastructure projects in developing countries. While the focus is broad, renewable energy and sustainable development are indeed important themes within the PGII's mandate. The statement accurately reflects the aims of the PGII.


**8. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and its relationship with India, consider the following statements:**

1. ASEAN comprises 18 member states, including Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the United States.
2. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) reviewed the agreement's progress and highlighted India's growing trade surplus with ASEAN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. ASEAN comprises ten Southeast Asian countries.  The statement mistakenly includes several non-ASEAN members, significantly misrepresenting the organization's composition. Accurate membership is fundamental to understanding regional dynamics.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with ASEAN.  This indicates a significant imbalance in trade flows, with India importing more from ASEAN than it exports.  The statement incorrectly states the nature of the trade balance.


**9. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced a SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 to enhance regional financial stability and cooperation, particularly in times of economic crisis.
2. SAARC's decision-making process requires consensus among all member states, which has often led to delays and hindered the organization's effectiveness, especially on contentious bilateral issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The RBI did announce a SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027, aiming to improve regional financial resilience. Currency swap agreements are a common tool for managing exchange rate volatility and providing liquidity support. The statement accurately reflects the RBI's initiative.

Statement 2 is correct.  SAARC's decision-making process relies on unanimity among all member states. This consensus-based approach has often been a source of difficulty, leading to delays and hindering progress on contentious issues. The statement correctly points out a structural challenge within SAARC.


**10. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reported a total of 168 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023, involving 31 states, highlighting the growing threat of nuclear terrorism.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IAEA's ITDB did report the number of incidents as stated. This highlights the ongoing challenge of securing nuclear materials. The statement accurately reflects the data from the ITDB.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative does use nuclear techniques to improve food security, its focus is broader than just GMO development.  It encompasses various applications of nuclear science and technology in agriculture, including pest control, soil improvement, and disease management. The statement oversimplifies the scope of the Atoms4Food initiative.


**11. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 categorized India among the "developing" countries, demonstrating a moderate commitment to cybersecurity pillars.
2. The GCI assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments across five pillars: legal framework, technical measures, capacity building, cooperation, and awareness, giving each pillar equal weighting.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India was categorized as a "role modelling" country (Tier 1) in the ITU's GCI 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity. The statement misrepresents India's ranking in the index.

Statement 2 is correct. The GCI does indeed assess cybersecurity across the five pillars mentioned, giving each equal weighting in its overall assessment.  This balanced approach is a key feature of the index's methodology. The statement correctly describes the GCI's assessment framework.


**12. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Operation Crimson Barracuda was India's first such operation *after* joining the CMF, it wasn't India's first counter-narcotics operation in the Arabian Sea. India has conducted such operations independently and in collaboration with other nations prior to joining the CMF. The statement misrepresents the historical context of India's counter-narcotics efforts.

Statement 2 is correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed a collaborative effort within the CMF framework.  While the specific details of the participating nations may vary, the operation exemplifies the collaborative nature of CMF initiatives. The statement accurately reflects the collaborative nature of the operation.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India is a signatory to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to fulfill its obligations under the convention.  The statement accurately reflects India's compliance with the CWC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons for *any* purpose, except for limited exceptions related to research, development, and production for pharmaceutical purposes, strictly under the control of the OPCW.  The statement misrepresents the CWC's restrictions on chemical weapon production.  The CWC has strict limitations on the production of chemicals, even for peaceful purposes.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key Indian institutions involved in combating money laundering, established in 2004 and 1956 respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's efforts against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a growing concern and related to financial crimes, it's not explicitly stated as an exclusion in the FATF's mandate for MERs. The focus remains primarily on the three core areas mentioned.

Statement 2 is correct.  The FIU-IND plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence to combat money laundering and related financial crimes. It was indeed established in 2004. The ED, established in 1956, is a key enforcement agency under the PMLA, actively involved in investigating and prosecuting money laundering cases.  The dates of establishment are accurately reflected in the statement.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, with cocaine being the least prevalent.
2. The UNODC's reports identify the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") including Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as major drug-producing regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the UNODC report does indeed highlight cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, the statement incorrectly claims cocaine is the least prevalent.  The report indicates that several drugs, including amphetamines and ecstasy, also feature prominently in global drug abuse patterns.  The ranking and relative prevalence of different drugs require a nuanced understanding of the report's data.

Statement 2 is correct.  The UNODC reports accurately pinpoint the geographical regions – the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle") and the "Golden Crescent" (renamed "Death Crescent") – as significant areas for drug production and trafficking.  The renaming reflects the severity of the drug-related issues in these regions.  The countries mentioned in both regions are accurately identified.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding international conventions related to weapons:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, while the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention focuses solely on the use of chemical weapons.
2.  The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but excludes crimes related to environmental damage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention comprehensively prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention similarly prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, not just their use as stated in the first statement. Both conventions address all aspects of the respective weapons, not just their use.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1998 Rome Statute indeed established the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. While the ICC's jurisdiction is extensive, it doesn't explicitly exclude environmental crimes; the focus remains on the core crimes against humanity and international law violations.  The core mandate of the ICC is accurately described.


**4. With reference to the ASEAN-India relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. India became a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN in 1996 and established a Strategic Partnership with ASEAN in 2012, while maintaining a trade surplus with ASEAN countries.
2. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues among ASEAN member states and their partners, and India is a founding member of the ARF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the chronology of India’s engagement with ASEAN (Dialogue Partner in 1996, Strategic Partnership in 2012) is accurate, the statement incorrectly states that India maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN.  India actually has a trade deficit with ASEAN nations, indicating that India imports more from ASEAN than it exports.  A key aspect of the India-ASEAN economic relationship is thus misrepresented.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is a member of the ARF but is not a founding member. The ARF was established in 1994, and India joined in 1996. The statement wrongly attributes founding membership to India. The chronology and membership status are inaccurately presented.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its 10th member, and the SCO's focus is primarily on economic cooperation, excluding security-related collaborations.
2. The SCO has adopted a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism, reflecting its commitment to regional security, while primarily focusing on Central Asian countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Belarus did indeed join the SCO, becoming its 10th member, the statement wrongly asserts that the SCO's focus is solely on economic cooperation.  The SCO's mandate encompasses both economic and security dimensions, with significant collaborations on counter-terrorism and regional security.  The scope of the SCO's activities is misrepresented.

Statement 2 is correct. The SCO has indeed adopted a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism, indicating a strong focus on security issues. While the SCO's membership includes countries beyond Central Asia, the region remains a significant area of focus for its security initiatives.  The statement accurately reflects the SCO's security-related activities and regional focus.


**6. Consider the following statements regarding India's international relations:**

1.  The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue adopted a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028, focusing primarily on economic cooperation and neglecting political and security aspects.
2.  The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is currently India’s largest trading partner bloc, and India has a trade surplus with the GCC countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India-GCC Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028 covers a wide range of areas, including political, security, economic, and cultural cooperation. It is not limited to economic aspects alone. The statement underestimates the scope of the Joint Action Plan.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GCC is a significant trading partner for India, it is not necessarily India's *largest* trading partner bloc.  Further, India has a trade *deficit* with the GCC, meaning it imports more from the GCC than it exports. The statement is inaccurate regarding both the ranking of the GCC as a trading partner and the nature of India's trade balance with the GCC.


**7. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

1. Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade, primarily focusing on hydropower projects in Nepal and Bhutan.
2. India is undertaking projects like the Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects (UKHP) in Nepal, and the Kurichu and Tala hydropower projects in Bhutan to enhance regional energy cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The trilateral pact between Nepal, India, and Bangladesh facilitates cross-border electricity trade. While hydropower is a significant component, the pact isn't solely limited to projects in Nepal and Bhutan; it aims to create a broader regional energy market.  The statement accurately reflects the core purpose of the pact.

Statement 2 is also correct. India is actively involved in hydropower projects in both Nepal (Arun III, UKHP) and Bhutan (Kurichu, Tala, and others). These projects contribute significantly to regional energy cooperation and security. The statement accurately identifies key hydropower projects undertaken by India in Nepal and Bhutan.


**8. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking, with a primary focus on incidents occurring within developed nations.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero programs utilize nuclear techniques to improve global food security and promote nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking globally, not just in developed nations. The database encompasses incidents from various countries, reflecting the global nature of nuclear security concerns. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the ITDB.

Statement 2 is correct. The IAEA's Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero initiatives are accurately described.  Atoms4Food uses nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural productivity and food security, while Atoms4NetZero explores the role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions targets. The programs and their objectives are accurately reflected.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments, and India is classified as a "role-modelling" country demonstrating a strong commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars.
2. The GCI 2024 indicates that most countries are either "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4) in their digital service expansion, showing a less developed cybersecurity infrastructure globally.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ITU's GCI 2024 does assess country-level cybersecurity commitments, and India is indeed among the "role-modelling" countries (Tier 1) demonstrating strong commitments across the five cybersecurity pillars. The statement accurately reflects India's GCI ranking and the index's purpose.

Statement 2 is also correct. The GCI 2024 does indeed indicate that most countries are in either the "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4) stages of digital service expansion, signifying a global trend towards developing cybersecurity infrastructure.  The statement accurately reflects the overall global trend revealed by the GCI.


**10. With reference to the Commonwealth of Nations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth established a Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund in 2018, with a budget of $100 million over 5 years.
2. Decisions within the Commonwealth are made by consensus, with all members considered equal; the Head of the Commonwealth is chosen by its members.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Commonwealth did establish a Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund in 2018, the budget allocated was $50 million over 5 years, not $100 million. The statement contains an error in the financial details.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Commonwealth operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, ensuring that all member states have an equal voice.  The Head of the Commonwealth is chosen by the member states.  The statement accurately describes the Commonwealth's decision-making mechanism and the selection process for its Head.


**1. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1. CAATSA primarily targets countries with significant economic ties to Russia, North Korea, and Iran, imposing sanctions to deter such engagements.
2.  An amendment to CAATSA was passed, exempting India from sanctions specifically for its purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CAATSA, enacted in 2017, is a US federal law designed to counter the influence of adversarial nations like Russia, North Korea, and Iran.  The act employs economic sanctions as a primary tool to discourage countries from engaging in significant transactions with these targeted states. Statement 1 accurately reflects this core objective of CAATSA.  Furthermore, in 2018, the US House of Representatives approved an amendment providing a waiver or exemption for India regarding its acquisition of the S-400 Triumf air defense system from Russia. This underscores the strategic importance of the US-India relationship and the flexibility built into the CAATSA framework.  Therefore, statement 2 is also correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because both statements accurately reflect aspects of CAATSA and its application to India.  The exemption for India highlights the nuanced application of sanctions policy based on geopolitical considerations.


**2. With reference to India-UK relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) during a virtual summit held in 2021, signifying a deepening of cooperation across multiple sectors.
2.  India and the UK collaborate within multilateral frameworks such as the QUAD, but the UK's "Indo-Pacific Tilt" strategy has negligible impact on India's strategic interests in the region.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The India-UK relationship has significantly strengthened in recent years, culminating in the elevation to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) during the 2021 virtual summit. This upgrade reflects a commitment to enhanced cooperation in areas like defense, trade, technology, and people-to-people ties. Statement 1 accurately captures this significant development. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The UK's "Indo-Pacific Tilt" strategy is not negligible in its impact on India's strategic interests.  In fact, the UK's focus on the Indo-Pacific region aligns considerably with India's own strategic outlook, enhancing cooperation in areas like maritime security and counter-terrorism. The two nations' collaboration in the QUAD further exemplifies this convergence of strategic interests. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of domestic anti-corruption measures.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and undergoes periodic review to assess the ongoing effectiveness of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's primary function is to assess and improve countries' efforts in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The MER is a crucial tool in this process, providing a comprehensive evaluation of a nation's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the MER does include assessment of measures related to combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and it is not limited to only money laundering and terrorist financing.  Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010, and subsequent reviews ensure that India’s AML/CFT measures remain aligned with international standards and best practices.  The periodic nature of the review process acknowledges the evolving nature of financial crimes and the need for ongoing adaptation.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report highlights that cannabis remains the most widely abused drug globally, surpassing opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy in terms of prevalence.
2. The report identifies the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle") encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand as a primary region for opium production, surpassing the "Golden Crescent" region in terms of overall opium production.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC's World Drug Day Report provides a comprehensive overview of global drug trends.  Statement 1 accurately reflects the report's findings, indicating that cannabis consistently ranks as the most widely used illicit drug.  While other substances like opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy are significant concerns, cannabis maintains its position as the most prevalent.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect.  While the "Death Triangle" (formerly the Golden Triangle) is indeed a significant region for drug production,  the report does not definitively state that it surpasses the "Death Crescent" (formerly the Golden Crescent) in overall opium production. The relative importance of these regions can fluctuate depending on various factors. Therefore, only statement 1 is supported by the UNODC's findings.


**5. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in designated "disturbed areas," allowing them to conduct operations without warrants and use lethal force when necessary, but does not provide immunity from legal proceedings.
2. AFSPA's applicability extends to parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, but not to Jammu and Kashmir, which operates under a separate but similar special powers act.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) grants extraordinary powers to the armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" by the government. These powers include the authority to conduct operations without warrants, arrest individuals without warrants, and use lethal force if deemed necessary to maintain order.  Statement 1 is incorrect because AFSPA does provide immunity to armed forces personnel from legal proceedings, except with the prior sanction of the Central Government.  Statement 2 is correct. AFSPA applies to parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh.  Jammu and Kashmir, however, operates under a separate but similar legislation, the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990, which grants equivalent special powers to the armed forces in that region.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**6. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  Both countries engage in joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN, fostering defense cooperation and regional stability.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India and Bangladesh share a complex and multifaceted relationship, with significant economic and strategic dimensions.  Statement 1 is partially correct. While Bangladesh is indeed a major trading partner for India within South Asia,  India is not Bangladesh's *largest* trading partner in Asia.  China holds that position for Bangladesh.   Statement 2 is correct.  India and Bangladesh actively participate in joint military exercises, such as SAMPRITI and MILAN, which contribute to enhanced defense cooperation and regional security.  These exercises demonstrate a commitment to collaborative security efforts.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct, making (b) the correct option.


**7. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. The Commonwealth's decisions are made through a voting system where each member state holds a weighted vote based on its economic contribution.
2.  King Charles III serves as the Head of the Commonwealth, a position he inherited, and he is also the Head of State in fourteen Commonwealth countries.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth of Nations is a voluntary association of 56 independent and equal sovereign states.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Commonwealth operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, not a weighted voting system.  All member states are considered equal in their decision-making power. Statement 2 is correct. King Charles III holds the position of Head of the Commonwealth, a largely symbolic role.  Significantly, he also serves as the Head of State in fourteen Commonwealth countries, often referred to as "realms,"  demonstrating the historical and ongoing ties between the monarchy and these nations.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**8. With reference to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), consider the following statements:**

1. The GCC comprises six Arab states located on the Persian Gulf, and its primary focus is on economic cooperation, excluding any significant political or security collaboration among member states.
2.  A Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028 was recently adopted at a joint India-GCC Ministerial Meeting, highlighting the strengthening of bilateral ties and cooperation across multiple sectors.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a regional intergovernmental political and economic union comprising six Arab states in Western Asia. Statement 1 is incorrect; while economic cooperation is a central pillar of the GCC, the organization also engages in significant political and security collaboration among its member states, working together on issues such as regional stability and security threats.  Statement 2 is correct.  The adoption of a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028 during a recent India-GCC Ministerial Meeting reflects a significant step towards strengthening bilateral relations and expanding cooperation across various sectors, including trade, investment, and security.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**9. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022 during the 5th summit in Sri Lanka, grants BIMSTEC legal personality, enhancing its ability to engage in international agreements and initiatives.
2. BIMSTEC's focus areas exclusively include trade, environment and climate change, security, and agriculture, excluding any significant emphasis on people-to-people contact or science and technology.

**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization comprising seven member states. Statement 1 accurately describes a key development: the adoption of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2022 granted the organization legal personality. This is a crucial step in strengthening BIMSTEC's international standing and its capacity to engage in various international agreements and initiatives.  Statement 2 is incorrect. BIMSTEC's focus areas extend beyond the listed sectors.  It also places significant emphasis on people-to-people contact and collaboration in science, technology, and innovation, reflecting the organization's broader goal of fostering comprehensive cooperation among its members.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**10. With reference to the QUAD, consider the following statements:**

1. The "Strengthening the Quad Act," passed by the US House of Representatives, aims to enhance cooperation among the QUAD nations (US, Australia, India, and Japan) primarily in the area of economic and trade relations.
2. The Wilmington Declaration, adopted at a recent QUAD Leaders' Summit, includes initiatives such as the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership and the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership," demonstrating a commitment to addressing global challenges beyond security.


**Which of the statements given above is/are correct?**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) is a strategic forum bringing together the US, Australia, India, and Japan. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the "Strengthening the Quad Act" does aim to bolster cooperation among the QUAD nations, its focus is not limited to economic and trade relations.  It addresses a broader range of strategic and security cooperation aspects.  Statement 2 is correct. The Wilmington Declaration, resulting from a recent QUAD Leaders' Summit, indeed includes initiatives such as the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" and the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership." These initiatives showcase the QUAD's expanding focus on addressing global challenges that extend beyond traditional security concerns, encompassing health, infrastructure, and sustainable development.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**1. With reference to the geographical location of Bolivia, consider the following statements:**

1. Bolivia shares land borders with Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, Chile, and Peru.
2.  Bolivia's maritime boundaries include the Pacific Ocean.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate. Bolivia is a landlocked country in South America, bordered by Brazil to the north and east, Paraguay to the southeast, Argentina to the south, Chile to the southwest and west, and Peru to the northwest.  The description of Bolivia's neighbors is entirely consistent with established geographical information.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Bolivia is a landlocked country; it does not have any maritime boundaries.  Historically, it had access to the Pacific Ocean, but this was lost in the War of the Pacific (1879-1884).  The inclusion of the Pacific Ocean as a maritime boundary is a significant factual error.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**2. With reference to Panama's geographical features and international relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Panama is situated on the Isthmus of Panama, a narrow strip of land connecting North and South America.
2. Panama shares maritime boundaries with the Caribbean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Panama's location on the Isthmus of Panama is a well-established geographical fact.  The Isthmus is a crucial geographical feature, connecting the continents of North and South America.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While Panama does share a maritime boundary with the Caribbean Sea, its other major maritime boundary is with the Pacific Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic Ocean is geographically distant from Panama.  The error in specifying the Atlantic Ocean instead of the Pacific Ocean renders the statement incorrect. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**3. With reference to the geopolitical context of Trinidad and Tobago, consider the following statements:**

1. Trinidad and Tobago is an island nation located in the northeastern Caribbean Sea, near the coast of Venezuela.
2. Trinidad and Tobago's close proximity to South America influences its economic and political relations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Trinidad and Tobago is indeed an island nation in the Caribbean, close to Venezuela's coast. However, specifying the "northeastern Caribbean Sea" is slightly imprecise; its location is more accurately described as being in the southern Caribbean.  While the imprecision does not invalidate the statement entirely, it is important to note the geographical nuance.

Statement 2 is correct.  Trinidad and Tobago's proximity to South America significantly impacts its economic and political relations.  This closeness facilitates trade, migration, and cultural exchange.  The statement accurately reflects the influence of geographical proximity on the nation's foreign affairs.  Therefore, both statements are essentially correct, though statement 1 has a minor geographical inaccuracy.


**4. With reference to New Zealand's geographical characteristics, consider the following statements:**

1. New Zealand comprises two main islands, the North Island and the South Island, separated by the Cook Strait.
2. New Zealand is situated entirely within the tropics, between the Equator and the Tropic of Capricorn.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. New Zealand's composition of two main islands, separated by the Cook Strait, is a well-known geographical fact.  The statement accurately reflects the country's island geography.

Statement 2 is incorrect. New Zealand is located in the Southern Hemisphere, and while parts of it are within subtropical latitudes, the entire country is not within the tropics.  It's situated between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle, extending significantly into the temperate zone. The statement misrepresents New Zealand's latitudinal position. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**5.  With reference to the geopolitical situation in the Pangong Tso region, consider the following statements:**

1. Pangong Tso is a saltwater lake, and a significant portion of it lies within Indian territory.
2. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Pangong Tso area is demarcated by the McMahon Line.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Pangong Tso is indeed a lake, and while it's described as a high-altitude saltwater lake,  the salinity is low and it is more accurately described as brackish. More importantly,  a significant portion of the lake is within Indian-claimed territory, although the exact division is a point of contention with China.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the McMahon Line plays a role in the broader India-China border dispute, it does not define the LAC in the Pangong Tso region. The LAC in this area is a disputed and undefined line, a subject of ongoing tension between India and China.  The statement incorrectly attributes the LAC demarcation to the McMahon Line in the specific context of Pangong Tso. Therefore, only statement 1 is largely correct, with the caveat of its salinity description.


**6. With reference to the India-Nepal border dispute, consider the following statements:**

1. The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) clearly defined the origin of the Kali River, resolving all border disputes between India and Nepal.
2. The Kalapani region is a tri-junction area involving India, Nepal, and Tibet (China), and is a source of significant territorial disagreement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) did establish a boundary between British India and Nepal, but the interpretation of the treaty, specifically regarding the origin of the Kali River, remains a point of contention, leading to ongoing border disputes. The treaty did not definitively resolve all border issues.

Statement 2 is correct. The Kalapani region is indeed a tri-junction area, involving India, Nepal, and China (Tibet), and it is a major source of territorial disagreement between India and Nepal. The statement accurately reflects this ongoing dispute. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the DRC is a very large country, it is not the largest in Africa by land area. Algeria holds that distinction. The statement misrepresents the DRC's size relative to other African nations.

Statement 2 is correct. The DRC shares land borders with nine other African nations: Angola, Burundi, Central African Republic, Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.  The statement accurately reflects the DRC's extensive network of land borders. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.



**1. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is formally demarcated and mutually agreed upon.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The LAC between India and China is not formally demarcated and there is no mutually agreed upon line.  The lack of a clearly defined boundary is a major source of tension between the two countries, leading to frequent disputes over territorial claims.  Different interpretations of historical maps and agreements contribute to the ongoing ambiguity.

Statement 2 is correct. The Galwan Valley clash of 2020 resulted in significant casualties on both sides, marking it as the deadliest border confrontation between India and China since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.  This incident significantly escalated tensions and led to a major deterioration in bilateral relations. The incident highlighted the vulnerability of the LAC and the need for stronger mechanisms to prevent future conflicts.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Pangong Tso lake:**

1. Pangong Tso is a Ramsar site, recognized for its ecological significance.
2.  A significant portion of Pangong Tso lies within the Indus River basin.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Pangong Tso is not currently designated as a Ramsar site, despite its ecological importance. While it possesses significant biodiversity and hydrological value, it hasn't yet met the criteria for Ramsar designation.  The process of gaining Ramsar status involves meeting specific ecological criteria and undergoing a formal application process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Pangong Tso is not part of the Indus River basin. It's an endorheic lake, meaning it has no outlet to the sea or any major river system.  Historically, it may have had a connection to the Shyok River (a tributary of the Indus), but this connection was severed due to natural damming.  This endorheic nature makes its water management and ecological balance particularly sensitive.

1. The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) unambiguously defined the origin of the Kali River, resolving the Kalapani dispute.
2. Nepal's claim to Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani is primarily based on its interpretation of the source of the Kali River.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) did demarcate a boundary between what was then British India and Nepal, using the Kali River as a reference. However, the exact source of the Kali River remains a point of contention, leading to disagreement over the location of the border in the Kalapani region. The ambiguity in the treaty's wording regarding the river's origin has fuelled the ongoing dispute.

Statement 2 is correct. Nepal's claim to the territories of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani rests heavily on its interpretation of the Kali River's origin.  Nepal argues that the river's source lies further west than India claims, placing these disputed territories within Nepalese territory.  This differing interpretation of the treaty and the river's source is central to the ongoing border dispute.


**4. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to high-income countries for infrastructure development.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIIB's mandate explicitly includes supporting infrastructure development in both developing and developed member countries.  While it does fund projects in higher-income nations, its primary focus is on providing financial resources to countries that need support in building and upgrading infrastructure, with a particular emphasis on developing economies.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Union Finance Minister of India has indeed advocated for the AIIB to increase its focus on providing financial resources to low-income countries. This reflects India's commitment to promoting infrastructure development and sustainable growth in less-developed nations, aligning with the AIIB's broader developmental goals.  This emphasis on supporting lower-income countries is a key aspect of India's foreign policy and development strategy.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, making it a transboundary lake. Its location in a relatively arid region makes its water resources and ecological balance particularly significant.

Statement 2 is incorrect.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, which are parts of the Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean respectively, but it doesn't directly connect the two oceans.  The canal significantly shortens the sea route between Europe and Asia, making it a crucial waterway for global trade.

Statement 2 is correct.  Due to geopolitical factors and potential disruptions, India has indeed adjusted its fuel export routes to Europe, shifting some shipments from the Suez Canal to the longer Cape of Good Hope route. This demonstrates the strategic importance of diversifying trade routes and reducing reliance on single, potentially vulnerable, pathways.  The Cape of Good Hope route, while longer, offers greater security and flexibility.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan. This trijunction point is a significant area of contention between India and Nepal, with disputes over territorial claims. The pass's strategic location and its proximity to the border between these three countries contributes to its geopolitical importance.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass serves as a crucial route for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.  Its use significantly shortens the travel time and distance compared to alternative routes, making it a preferred passage for many pilgrims. The pass's accessibility and location make it a convenient and efficient route for this important religious journey.

This treaty was revised in 2007 to reflect the evolving dynamics of the relationship and to better address contemporary challenges. The treaty reflects the close and unique nature of the relationship between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, the balance of trade is significantly in India's favour, not Bhutan's.  This reflects the substantial economic assistance and investment India provides to Bhutan, as well as the pattern of trade between the two countries.  India's role in Bhutan's economic development is a key aspect of their bilateral relationship.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's introduction of the RuPay card in the Maldives is part of a broader effort to enhance financial connectivity and provide an alternative to existing payment systems. This initiative aims to promote financial inclusion and strengthen economic ties between the two countries. The expansion of RuPay’s reach reflects India’s focus on South Asian regional cooperation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives actually advocated for the *reduction* of Indian military presence and influence in the country. This campaign reflects a segment of Maldivian public opinion concerned about the extent of Indian influence and its potential impact on Maldivian sovereignty.  This highlights the complexities and sensitivities in the India-Maldives relationship.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021, and aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not $500 billion by 2025. While sustainable infrastructure is a key focus, the target amount and timeframe are different from what's stated.  The statement also oversimplifies the scope; the PGII encompasses a broader range of infrastructure projects than just sustainable ones.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While energy and transportation are significant sectors, the PGII's focus is not solely on large-scale projects within those sectors.  It aims for sustainable and inclusive infrastructure development across various sectors, considering the specific needs of each developing nation.

(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

While NAM's position on Cuba highlights its concern for Global South countries,  it doesn't necessarily represent a consistent blanket opposition to *all* unilateral sanctions. NAM's approach to international relations is complex and nuanced, shaped by specific geopolitical contexts and the interests of its diverse membership.  The statement overgeneralizes NAM's position.

Statement 2 is correct. The US's unilateral designation of states as sponsors of terrorism is a sovereign decision based on its own intelligence and assessment. While there might be consultations with allies, the final decision rests solely with the US government, independent of international bodies. The statement accurately reflects the unilateral nature of the US designation process.


**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is the largest member by population and a significant contributor, it's not the second-largest contributor to the Commonwealth's budget. The exact ranking of financial contributions varies and isn't consistently publicized. The statement misrepresents India's financial contribution to the Commonwealth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window, while supporting development initiatives, does not focus *exclusively* on gender equality. Its scope encompasses various development goals within the framework of the India-UN Development Fund. The statement wrongly limits the focus area of the Commonwealth Sub Window.  The fund supports a wider range of development projects, and gender equality is one of several priorities.


**4. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) only tracks incidents related to nuclear weapons material, excluding other forms of nuclear material.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative solely focuses on promoting the use of nuclear fusion energy to achieve net-zero emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB tracks incidents involving all types of nuclear and other radioactive material, not just those related to nuclear weapons.  The statement significantly narrows down the scope of the ITDB.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While nuclear fusion is a potential pathway to net-zero emissions, Atoms4NetZero encompasses a broader range of nuclear technologies aimed at reducing emissions. It includes both fission and fusion technologies. The statement inaccurately restricts the focus of Atoms4NetZero to only nuclear fusion.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade and investment between India and European Union member states, excluding the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC, as its name suggests, is designed to improve connectivity and cooperation among India, Middle Eastern countries, and Europe.  The statement incorrectly omits the Middle East from the corridor's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMEC's success depends on the collaborative efforts of India, Middle Eastern nations, and European countries. It is not a solely Indian-led initiative. The statement misrepresents the IMEC as a purely unilateral Indian project, ignoring the involvement of other key players.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's 2025-2027 Cooperation Program focuses exclusively on countering terrorism, with no mention of other transnational crimes.
2.  The SCO's Development Strategy until 2035 prioritizes economic cooperation over security cooperation.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While countering terrorism is a major focus, the SCO's cooperation program likely addresses other transnational challenges like separatism and extremism.  The statement oversimplifies the scope of the cooperation program.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The SCO's development strategy likely balances both economic and security cooperation, recognizing their interconnectedness in regional stability and development. The statement presents a false dichotomy between economic and security cooperation within the SCO framework.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7's working mechanism involves a permanent secretariat that oversees its activities throughout the year.
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while led by the G7, excludes participation from African nations in its implementation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 operates on a rotating presidency system, lacking a permanent secretariat. Each member nation holds the presidency for a year, setting the agenda and priorities. The statement misrepresents the G7's organizational structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative aims to facilitate investment in clean energy projects in Africa, requiring active involvement and participation from African nations. The statement falsely claims the exclusion of African nations from the initiative's implementation.


**8. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes other forms of financial crime.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's MER focuses on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as its core areas of assessment. While other financial crimes are related, they are not the primary focus of the MER. The statement accurately describes the scope of the FATF's MER.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2005. The statement contains an inaccurate timeframe regarding India's first MER adoption.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  According to the provided text, cannabis is the most abused drug globally, not cocaine. The statement misrepresents the UNODC's findings on drug abuse.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, not just Africa.  It covers illegal wildlife trade across various regions. The statement wrongly limits the report's geographical focus.


**10. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2023.
2.  BIMSTEC's focus areas include trade, environment, security, and agriculture, but exclude connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force on May 20, 2024, not in 2023. The statement provides an incorrect year for the Charter's implementation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Connectivity is explicitly mentioned as one of BIMSTEC's seven focus areas.  The statement omits a key area of focus for BIMSTEC.


**11. With reference to the Quad, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focuses solely on combating breast cancer.
2.  The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to improve port infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region, but excludes any focus on sustainability.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Sustainability is a key component of the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership."  The statement omits a crucial aspect of the partnership's objectives.


**12. With reference to the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses only the technological aspects of cybersecurity, excluding legal and policy frameworks.
2.  The GCI 2024 categorizes countries into only three tiers based on their cybersecurity preparedness.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GCI likely considers multiple aspects of cybersecurity, including technological, legal, and policy dimensions. The statement wrongly limits the scope of the GCI's assessment.

**13. With reference to India's relations with Singapore, consider the following statements:**

1.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner globally.
2.  Project Nexus, a collaborative initiative between Singapore and India, aims to connect their domestic fast payment systems to facilitate cross-border payments.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner, the text indicates it's India's largest trade partner within ASEAN and its 6th largest globally. The statement misrepresents Singapore's overall ranking as India's trading partner.

Statement 2 is correct. Project Nexus accurately describes the collaborative initiative between Singapore and India to connect their domestic fast payment systems for cross-border transactions. The statement accurately describes the purpose of Project Nexus.


**14. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative project between India and Bangladesh, but it's entirely funded by Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, and India is the second biggest trade partner of Bangladesh in Asia.  The statement accurately describes the trade relationship between the two countries.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project, it is not solely funded by Bangladesh; it involves Indian investment and collaboration. The statement misrepresents the funding structure of the joint project.


**15. With reference to the Maldives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Maldives is composed of volcanic islands.
2.  The 8-degree Channel separates the island of Minicoy from the main Lakshadweep archipelago.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Maldives are composed of coral atolls, not volcanic islands. The statement misrepresents the geological formation of the Maldives.

Statement 2 is correct. The 8-degree Channel separates Minicoy from the Maldives, as stated in the provided text. The statement accurately describes the geographical location of the 8-degree channel.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  measures against cybercrimes.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, utilizing a standardized methodology across all participating nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF's MER primarily focuses on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  it's inaccurate to say it *excludes* assessments related to cybercrimes.  The FATF's recommendations increasingly encompass the financial aspects of cybercrime, recognizing its links to money laundering and terrorist financing. Although not the primary focus of the MER, the evaluation considers relevant aspects of a country's efforts to combat cybercrime's financial implications.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010. The process is a peer review conducted by FATF members, ensuring a consistent and standardized evaluation across countries.  This peer review mechanism is crucial for maintaining the integrity and effectiveness of the FATF's global standards.  The standardized methodology helps to compare and contrast the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes of different countries objectively.


**2. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC, a 7,200 km multi-modal transportation network, was established in 2000 by an agreement among India, Iran, Russia, and Kazakhstan, aiming to connect India with Central Asia and Europe via Iran.
2. The Chabahar Port, located on the Gulf of Oman, serves as a crucial node within the INSTC, providing a direct sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan, and thus significantly reducing transit times compared to traditional routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INSTC is indeed a 7,200 km multi-modal transportation network established to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia,  the initial agreement in 2000 did not include Kazakhstan.  Kazakhstan joined the INSTC later. The core initial members were India, Iran, and Russia.  The expansion to include other Central Asian countries highlights the corridor's growing importance for regional connectivity.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chabahar Port's strategic location on the Gulf of Oman makes it a vital component of the INSTC. It offers a direct sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan, which significantly reduces the time and cost of transporting goods compared to traditional routes that pass through Pakistan. This bypass is crucial for India's strategic interests in the region.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IPEF, launched in 2022, includes four pillars: trade, technology, supply chains, and clean energy, with a focus on creating a comprehensive trade agreement among participating countries.
2. India signed agreements under the IPEF focusing on the Clean Economy and Fair Economy pillars,  but notably declined to participate in the IPEF's Supply Chain pillar, citing concerns about its potential impact on domestic industries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While IPEF aims to enhance economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, its structure doesn't consist of four pillars structured as a comprehensive trade agreement.  Instead, it focuses on four distinct pillars: trade, technology, supply chains, and clean energy, each with its own set of agreements and initiatives.  It's not a single, overarching trade agreement but a framework for several agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India did participate in the IPEF's Supply Chain pillar.  India's participation in the Supply Chain pillar, along with its engagement in the Clean Economy and Fair Economy pillars, reflects its commitment to strengthening regional economic ties and promoting a more resilient and inclusive Indo-Pacific.  The statement wrongly implies India's non-participation in the Supply Chain pillar.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO, initially focused on security cooperation, has expanded its scope to include economic and cultural cooperation, with a particular emphasis on enhancing connectivity and infrastructure development across member states.
2.  Belarus's recent accession as the 10th member of the SCO marks a significant expansion of the organization's geographic reach, extending its influence into Eastern Europe and potentially altering the geopolitical dynamics of the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The SCO, initially focused primarily on security and counter-terrorism cooperation, has significantly broadened its agenda to include economic and cultural dimensions.  The organization actively promotes connectivity projects and infrastructure development to foster greater economic integration among its members.  This expansion reflects the SCO's evolving role in shaping regional dynamics.

Statement 2 is correct. Belarus's admission as the 10th member state represents a notable expansion of the SCO's geographical footprint into Eastern Europe.  This expansion has significant geopolitical implications, potentially shifting the balance of power in the region and increasing the SCO's overall influence on the global stage.  The inclusion of Belarus adds a new layer of complexity to the organization's dynamics.


**5.  With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's  charter, adopted in 2022, grants the organization legal personality,  allowing it to enter into international agreements and engage in more robust cooperation with other international organizations.
2.  Despite its diverse membership, BIMSTEC has consistently demonstrated a high level of consensus and efficient decision-making, resulting in the swift implementation of major infrastructure projects such as the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The adoption of the BIMSTEC charter in 2022 conferred legal personality upon the organization. This is a significant development, enabling BIMSTEC to engage more effectively in international relations, enter into agreements, and participate more fully in global governance.  The legal personality strengthens BIMSTEC's capacity for action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While BIMSTEC aims for regional cooperation, the assertion that it has consistently demonstrated a high level of consensus and efficient decision-making, leading to the swift implementation of major projects, is an oversimplification.  The organization has faced challenges in achieving consensus among its diverse membership, and the implementation of major projects has often been slower than initially envisioned due to varying national interests and priorities.  The statement presents an overly optimistic view of BIMSTEC's operational efficiency.


**6. With reference to  India's relations with Malaysia, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malaysia is a significant trading partner for India,  with both countries having signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) to further enhance bilateral trade and investment flows.  India is a net exporter to Malaysia.
2.  To improve people-to-people contact, India has facilitated the acceptance of UPI payments in Malaysia, making cross-border transactions more convenient for Indian citizens living and working in Malaysia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Malaysia is an important trading partner for India, and a CECA exists to boost trade, the assertion that India is a net exporter to Malaysia is not entirely accurate.  The balance of trade between India and Malaysia is dynamic and fluctuates depending on various factors, including global commodity prices and specific trade patterns.  The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially inaccurate picture of the bilateral trade relationship.

Statement 2 is correct.  To facilitate cross-border transactions and improve the convenience for Indian citizens in Malaysia, India has indeed promoted the acceptance of UPI payments. This initiative aims to make remittances and other financial transactions simpler and more efficient.  This reflects India's commitment to strengthening people-to-people ties with Malaysia.


**7. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" highlights the movement's commitment to defending the sovereignty and self-determination of its member states, particularly those facing undue pressure from major powers.
2.  NAM, established during the Cold War,  has since lost much of its relevance in the multipolar world, with many member states now forging closer ties with either the US or China, diminishing the movement's collective influence on global affairs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's advocacy for Cuba's removal from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism underscores its commitment to supporting member states' sovereignty and opposing unilateral actions that violate international law and norms.  The movement seeks to protect its members from undue external pressure and promote a more equitable international order.  This action reflects a core principle of NAM.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While NAM's influence may have evolved in the multipolar world, to say it has lost *much* of its relevance is an overstatement.  The movement continues to be a significant platform for many developing countries to voice their concerns and advocate for their interests on the global stage.  Although the Cold War context has changed, NAM's core principles of non-alignment and defending the interests of developing nations remain pertinent.  The statement presents a too-negative assessment of NAM's current role.


**8. With reference to the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day Report indicates that cannabis is the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with the Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) being among the regions most affected by drug trafficking.
2.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the significant increase in wildlife trafficking in recent years, driven primarily by growing demand in Asian markets, with a particular focus on the illegal trade of endangered species like elephants and rhinos.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UNODC's World Drug Day Report accurately reflects the global drug abuse trends, identifying cannabis as the most widely used illicit drug, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The report also correctly points out the Triple Frontier Area and the Golden Triangle as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking.  The information provided aligns with the UNODC's findings.

Statement 2 is partially correct in that it mentions the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report, but the specifics about the increase in wildlife trafficking being "primarily driven by growing demand in Asian markets, with a particular focus on the illegal trade of endangered species like elephants and rhinos" lack sufficient precision. While Asian markets are indeed a major factor, the report likely presents a more nuanced picture, encompassing various factors and species, beyond just elephants and rhinos.  The statement oversimplifies the report's findings, making it less accurate.  The specific focus on elephants and rhinos is potentially misleading.


**1. With reference to the UN peacekeeping operations in 2023, consider the following statements:**

1.  The majority of UN peacekeeping troops were deployed in the Middle East, reflecting the region's ongoing conflicts.
2.  Brazil was the largest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East. This highlights the significant peacekeeping challenges faced by this region.  The concentration of peacekeeping efforts in a specific geographic area reflects the evolving nature of global conflicts and the UN's response to them.  Focusing on one region while ignoring others creates a misleading picture of the overall peacekeeping landscape.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly indicates that India was the highest contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, not Brazil. This underscores India's significant commitment to multilateral peace operations and its role in maintaining international stability.  The difference between India's contribution and that of other nations highlights the varying levels of commitment among member states and the complexities of international cooperation in peacekeeping.  Misrepresenting the largest contributor misleads the understanding of the distribution of peacekeeping responsibilities.


**2. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) complete control over civilian personnel attached to these organizations.
2.  An ISO is defined solely as a body of troops under the command of a single service, such as the Army or Air Force.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Act does empower the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with significant disciplinary and administrative powers, this authority applies to *serving or attached personnel*, not civilian personnel.  The distinction between military and civilian personnel is crucial in understanding the scope of the Act and its implications for the chain of command within inter-service organizations.  The inclusion of civilian personnel in the statement creates a false impression of the Act's reach.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The definition of an ISO explicitly includes a Joint Services Command consisting of personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957, or any two of these Acts. This clearly indicates that ISOs are not limited to a single service but can involve personnel from multiple branches of the armed forces.  The narrow definition presented in the statement misrepresents the organizational structure and composition of ISOs as defined by the Act.


**3. With reference to Operation Vijay (1999), consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Talwar, a key operation during the Kargil War, involved the Indian Air Force's targeting of Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions.
2. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC), established after the war, was chaired by Atal Bihari Vajpayee.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval operation launched by the Indian Navy to blockade Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea, not an air force operation targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions. This was Operation Safed Sagar. The confusion between the two operations highlights the need for precise understanding of military operations and their respective roles.  Attributing a naval operation to the air force demonstrates a lack of understanding of the different branches of the armed forces and their distinct roles in warfare.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam, not Atal Bihari Vajpayee.  Vajpayee was the Prime Minister during the war, but the KRC's chairmanship was held by a different individual.  The confusion between the Prime Minister and the KRC chair demonstrates a lack of precision regarding the individuals and their roles in the aftermath of the Kargil War.


**4. With reference to the ASEAN-India relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) resulted in a significant trade surplus for India with ASEAN countries.
2. Russia is not a member of the East Asia Summit (EAS), a key forum for ASEAN-India cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This indicates an imbalance in trade flows, with ASEAN exporting more goods to India than India exports to ASEAN.  The misrepresentation of the trade balance misleads the understanding of the economic dynamics between India and ASEAN.  A simple reversal of the trade balance highlights the importance of understanding the details of international trade relationships.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text clearly lists Russia as a member of the East Asia Summit (EAS).  The EAS is a significant forum for regional cooperation, and the inclusion of Russia demonstrates the broad scope of the forum's membership.  Excluding Russia from the EAS membership creates a false impression of the forum's composition and its role in regional diplomacy.


**5. With reference to the  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's recent re-election to the INCB marks his second term on the board.
2. The INCB's mandate includes monitoring illicit drug trafficking but excludes the regulation of precursor chemicals used in drug production.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that Jagjit Pavadia's re-election is for his *third* term, not his second. This highlights the continuity of leadership within the INCB and the importance of experience in addressing global drug control challenges. The difference between second and third term shows the importance of precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The INCB's mandate is broad and includes monitoring illicit drug trafficking *and* the regulation of precursor chemicals.  Precursor chemicals are essential components in the production of many illicit drugs, and controlling their flow is crucial for disrupting drug production networks.  Excluding precursor chemicals from the INCB's mandate creates a false impression of its scope and effectiveness in combating drug production.  The omission of precursor chemicals from the statement shows a lack of complete understanding of the INCB's functions.


**6. With reference to the  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) network, consider the following statements:**

1. GLOBE's membership is limited to countries within the South Asian region.
2. India's election to the GLOBE steering committee signifies its commitment to international cooperation in combating corruption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text provides no information to suggest that GLOBE's membership is limited to South Asian countries.  GLOBE is a global network, and its membership likely includes countries from various regions, reflecting the transnational nature of corruption.  Limiting the membership to a single region creates a false impression of the network's scope and reach.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the GLOBE steering committee demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts and its willingness to participate in global initiatives to tackle this challenge.  This highlights India's proactive role in promoting good governance and transparency on the world stage.  The statement accurately reflects the significance of India's participation in GLOBE.


**7. With reference to the India-US defence relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.
2.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been invoked against India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2018.  The difference in dates highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding the chronology of agreements and milestones in the India-US defence relationship.  A simple one year difference demonstrates the need to be precise about the timeline of important agreements.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text explicitly mentions that the US State Department warned India of potential sanctions under CAATSA after the India-Iran deal on the Chabahar port.  This demonstrates that CAATSA has been used as a tool to exert pressure on countries engaging with adversaries designated by the US.  The statement ignores a significant event in the India-US relationship, demonstrating a lack of awareness of the complexities involved.


**8. With reference to the countries bordering the Arabian Sea, consider the following statements:**

1.  Iraq shares a maritime border with the Arabian Sea.
2.  Oman is located to the west of the Arabian Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Iraq does not border the Arabian Sea; it is a landlocked country.  The inclusion of a landlocked country in the list of countries bordering the Arabian Sea shows a lack of geographical awareness.  A simple check of a map would reveal the inaccuracy of the statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Oman is located to the *east* of the Arabian Sea, not the west.  The misplacement of Oman demonstrates a lack of basic geographical knowledge.  A simple map would clarify the correct location of Oman.


**9. With reference to the  Kargil Review Committee (KRC), consider the following statements:**

1. The KRC's recommendations focused solely on military aspects of national security, neglecting other critical areas.
2.  The KRC was established immediately after the end of the Kargil War.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the KRC's recommendations addressed military preparedness and strategy, they also covered broader aspects of national security, including intelligence gathering, border management, and political decision-making processes.  The statement creates a false impression of the KRC's limited scope.  The omission of the non-military recommendations shows a lack of comprehensive understanding of the KRC's work.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The KRC was established in July 1999, which was after the end of the conflict.  The timing of the KRC's establishment is important in understanding the context of its formation and its objectives.  The incorrect timeline creates a misleading impression of the KRC's establishment.


**10. With reference to the  weaponization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly permits the deployment of conventional weapons in space.
2.  Militarization of space refers solely to the deployment of weapons in space.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty aims to prevent the weaponization of outer space; it bans weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit or on celestial bodies.  The statement misrepresents the treaty's core objective.  The statement presents a direct contradiction of the treaty's purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Militarization of space encompasses a broader range of activities than just weapon deployment, including the use of space for military intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, as well as for supporting ground, sea, and air-based military operations.  The statement presents a narrow and incomplete definition of militarization.  The limited scope of the definition shows a lack of understanding of the multifaceted nature of space militarization.


**1. With reference to India's participation in UN peacekeeping operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India consistently ranks among the top contributors of military personnel to UN peacekeeping missions globally, showcasing its commitment to international peace and security.
2.  The majority of UN peacekeeping deployments involving Indian personnel are concentrated in regions experiencing high levels of conflict and instability, demanding significant logistical and operational challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India has a long-standing and significant contribution to UN peacekeeping operations.  It consistently ranks among the top troop-contributing countries, reflecting its commitment to multilateralism and international peace and security.  This commitment is demonstrated through consistent personnel deployment and substantial financial contributions.  India's participation is a key element of its foreign policy, aiming to project a positive image on the global stage.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While a significant portion of Indian peacekeeping deployments are indeed in conflict zones, claiming that the *majority* are concentrated in regions of high instability is an overstatement.  India's peacekeeping contributions are spread across various regions and missions, responding to the specific needs and mandates of the UN.  The deployment locations vary based on the UN's requirements, and India's participation is not limited to only the most volatile areas.  While challenging deployments exist, the statement presents an inaccurate generalization.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  "Exercise Vajra Prahar" is a joint military exercise exclusively between the Indian Army and the US Army, focusing on counter-terrorism and high-altitude warfare tactics.
2.  "Exercise Tarkash," a joint counter-terrorism exercise, involves only the Indian Army and the US Army, focusing on urban warfare scenarios and close-quarters combat techniques.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. While "Exercise Vajra Prahar" is indeed a joint military exercise between India and the US, it involves both army and special forces, and is not exclusively limited to counter-terrorism or high-altitude warfare, although those aspects are components.  The exercise encompasses a broader scope of military cooperation. Similarly, "Exercise Tarkash" is a joint counter-terrorism exercise but involves both the Indian and US armies, and its focus isn't solely on urban warfare and close-quarters combat.  It involves a wider range of counter-terrorism scenarios and training exercises.  The statements oversimplify the scope and objectives of these exercises.


**3.  With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Chabahar Port's development is solely driven by a bilateral agreement between India and Iran, with no involvement from other nations.
2.  The primary strategic objective of the Chabahar Port is to provide India with an alternative route to Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan and facilitating access to Central Asian markets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India and Iran are key players in the development of the Chabahar Port, it is not solely a bilateral agreement.  The initial development involved a tripartite agreement including Afghanistan, aiming to enhance regional connectivity and trade. While the current agreement might be primarily between India and Iran, the port's development and strategic significance extend beyond a strictly bilateral framework.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Chabahar Port's strategic importance lies in providing India with an alternative route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan, which has historically posed geopolitical challenges to India's access to these regions. This bypass significantly reduces transit time and enhances trade and connectivity opportunities for India.  The port is a crucial component of India's broader strategy to strengthen ties with Central Asia and Afghanistan.


**4. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INSTC's primary aim is to establish a direct maritime route between India and Russia, bypassing the Suez Canal and significantly reducing transit times.
2. The INSTC is a purely land-based transportation route, aiming to connect India with Central Asia and Russia via land routes only.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. The INSTC is a multimodal transport corridor, meaning it utilizes various modes of transportation including sea, rail, and road.  While it aims to reduce transit times compared to traditional routes, it doesn't exclusively focus on bypassing the Suez Canal.  Its route optimization is complex, considering various factors for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  The second statement is completely wrong as the INSTC is a multimodal corridor, not solely land-based.  It incorporates maritime routes and aims to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran and Central Asia, using a mix of transportation methods.


**5. With reference to India-US defense relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) is a legally binding agreement that guarantees the uninterrupted supply of defense equipment between India and the US, even during times of conflict.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) allows for reciprocal access to each other's military bases and logistical facilities, fostering greater interoperability and mutual support.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The SOSA is not a legally binding agreement in the sense of imposing strict penalties for non-compliance. It is more of a commitment to prioritize and facilitate the timely provision of defense-related goods and services.  It aims to ensure reliable supply chains but doesn't carry the same legal weight as a formal treaty.

Statement 2 is correct.  The LEMOA is a significant agreement that enables reciprocal access to military bases and logistical facilities between India and the US.  This facilitates greater interoperability, joint training exercises, and mutual support during operations or emergencies.  It is a crucial element in the strengthening defense cooperation between the two countries.


**6. With reference to Russia's geography, consider the following statements:**

1. The Ural Mountains form a natural boundary separating Europe and Asia, with the highest peak being Mount Elbrus, located within the Caucasus Mountain range.
2.  Lake Baikal, located in Russia, is renowned as the world's deepest and oldest freshwater lake, while the Caspian Sea is the world's largest enclosed inland body of water.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Ural Mountains are indeed a significant geographical feature that conventionally marks the boundary between Europe and Asia.  However, Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in Europe, is located in the Caucasus Mountains, not the Urals.  The statement is partially correct in its description of the Ural Mountains as a boundary but needs correction concerning the location of Mount Elbrus.

Statement 2 is correct.  Lake Baikal is globally recognized as the world's deepest and oldest freshwater lake.  The Caspian Sea holds the distinction of being the world's largest enclosed inland body of water (or lake). Both facts are geographically accurate.  The statement correctly identifies the unique features of both these water bodies.



**7. With reference to  India's relations with other countries, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Malaysia have conducted only joint military exercises, with no significant economic or cultural exchanges.
2.  India's relationship with Thailand is primarily focused on defense cooperation, neglecting other dimensions like trade and cultural ties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Both statements are incorrect. India's relationship with Malaysia extends beyond military exercises, encompassing significant economic and cultural exchanges.  Both countries have strong trade relations and share cultural affinities. The statement oversimplifies the multifaceted nature of their relationship. Similarly, India's relationship with Thailand is not solely focused on defense cooperation. While defense exercises are a component, significant trade, cultural, and people-to-people connections exist.  The statement provides an incomplete and inaccurate portrayal of the bilateral relationship.


**8. With reference to multilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  "Exercise Malabar" is a predominantly maritime exercise involving the US, Japan, Australia and India, focusing solely on naval warfare tactics.
2.  "Exercise RIMPAC" is the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, with India being a regular participant and focusing primarily on anti-submarine warfare.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While "Exercise Malabar" is a major maritime exercise involving the US, Japan, Australia, and India, it is not solely focused on naval warfare tactics.  It encompasses a broader range of maritime operations, including anti-submarine warfare, amphibious operations, and information sharing. The statement overly simplifies the exercise's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  "Exercise RIMPAC" is indeed the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India is a regular participant. However,  its focus is not primarily on anti-submarine warfare.  It covers a wide spectrum of maritime operations, including humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, disaster response, and a range of naval warfare exercises. The statement inaccurately emphasizes only one area of the exercise.


**1. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily a bilateral initiative between India and the European Union, aiming to enhance trade relations.
2.  IMEC's primary objective is to reduce transportation costs and time between India and Europe by utilizing existing maritime routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  IMEC is not primarily a bilateral initiative between India and the European Union.  It's a multi-lateral corridor encompassing several Middle Eastern countries in addition to India and Europe, aiming to create a more robust and interconnected trade network. The corridor is designed to boost economic cooperation and connectivity across a vast geographical region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IMEC aims to improve efficiency and reduce costs, it doesn't solely rely on existing maritime routes. It is envisioned as a multimodal corridor, potentially incorporating land-based routes and infrastructure developments to optimize transport across various regions. The goal is not just to use existing infrastructure but to create a more efficient and integrated system of transportation across multiple modes to improve overall connectivity and efficiency. The focus is on creating a comprehensive transport network, rather than just relying on existing maritime routes.


**2. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on military cooperation among its member states, with a secondary emphasis on economic and cultural exchange.
2.  Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 significantly expanded the organization's geographical reach into Eastern Europe, strengthening its influence in the region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the SCO does address security concerns and has a military component, its mandate extends far beyond purely military cooperation.  The SCO focuses on a broad range of issues, including economic cooperation, cultural exchange, and combating terrorism, separatism, and extremism.  It aims to foster regional stability and development through multifaceted collaboration.

Statement 2 is correct.  Belarus's accession to the SCO in 2024 did indeed expand the organization's geographical reach, extending its influence into Eastern Europe. This signifies a strategic shift for the SCO, broadening its membership base and likely influencing regional dynamics.

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council is primarily focused on resolving trade disputes between participating nations, ensuring fair and equitable trade practices.
2.  The IPEF's Crisis Response Network aims to enhance regional supply chain resilience by providing a platform for coordinated responses to disruptions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening, not primarily resolving disputes within, critical supply chains.  While dispute resolution might be a part of the overall effort, the core function is to improve resilience and diversification of supply chains across the Indo-Pacific region.  The council aims to enhance the reliability and security of essential supply chains.

Statement 2 is correct. The IPEF's Crisis Response Network is explicitly designed to improve the resilience of regional supply chains by fostering coordinated responses to disruptions. This network aims to facilitate collaboration and information sharing among member countries to minimize the impact of disruptions, such as natural disasters or geopolitical events.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While security is a component, the "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and the Maldives encompasses a broader range of cooperation, including economic development, infrastructure projects, and maritime security.  It aims to deepen overall bilateral ties.  The focus is not solely on military aspects.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the RuPay card launch in the Maldives aims to provide an alternative payment option, it is not primarily focused on reducing reliance on the US dollar or promoting the Indian Rupee as a dominant currency.  The aim is to expand payment options and improve financial inclusion.


**7. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore has resulted in a significant trade surplus for India.
2.  Project Nexus, a collaborative initiative, aims to connect India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with Singapore's domestic fast payment systems.

**9. With reference to India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Malaysia is India's largest trading partner within the ASEAN region.
2.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Malaysia has significantly reduced India's reliance on palm oil imports from Malaysia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Malaysia is a significant trading partner for India within ASEAN, it is not India's largest trading partner in the region.  Other ASEAN nations have larger trade volumes with India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CECA between India and Malaysia, while aiming to improve trade relations, has not significantly reduced India's reliance on palm oil imports from Malaysia.  Malaysia remains a major supplier of palm oil to India.  The CECA has a broader impact on bilateral trade beyond just palm oil.


**10. With reference to India-Russia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reciprocal Exchange of Logistics Agreement (RELOS) between India and Russia allows for unrestricted access to each other's military bases and installations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The RELOS agreement between India and Russia does not allow for unrestricted access.  It provides for access to logistics and support facilities at designated bases and ports, but it's not an open-door policy to all military installations.  The agreement is carefully calibrated to address specific logistical needs.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Russia became a major crude oil supplier to India,  the statement that it has consistently been the top supplier *since the start of the Ukraine conflict* is an oversimplification.  The ranking of crude oil suppliers can fluctuate based on various factors, including geopolitical events and market dynamics.  Other countries have also been major suppliers to India during this period.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect. SAFTA doesn't establish a full customs union; it focuses on reducing, but not eliminating, tariffs and non-tariff barriers. A customs union would require a common external tariff, which SAFTA doesn't mandate. Statement 2 is correct; SAFTA was signed in 2006 with the primary aim of fostering regional economic integration and trade liberalization within the SAARC region.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text highlights that EFTA is *not* a customs union, implying the TEPA wouldn't create one either.  The agreement focuses on fostering trade ties but doesn't necessitate a harmonized external tariff policy. Statement 2 is correct. The TEPA's primary objective is to strengthen trade and economic cooperation between India and EFTA countries, acknowledging the distinct nature of EFTA's structure as a free trade area, not a customs union.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions Arun III and UKHP as examples of India-Nepal collaboration in hydropower. Statement 2 is incorrect.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  It holds the distinction of being the largest permanent desert lake globally, and the fourth largest lake in Africa. The provided description accurately reflects its geographical location and unique characteristics as a large, permanent alkaline lake in a desert environment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly states that a recent survey, the first in 50 years, revealed *high* fish potential in Lake Turkana, contradicting the claim of low fish potential. This highlights a crucial detail often overlooked in assessments of natural resources: periodic resurveys are essential to update our understanding of resource availability and potential. The statement attempts to mislead by inverting a key finding from the source material.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1.  Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Kenya, Africa, and is the highest peak in Africa.
2.  A recent expedition team, under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence, hoisted the Indian national flag on the Mawenzi Peak of Mount Kilimanjaro.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa and a stratovolcano, its location is specified as Tanzania, not Kenya.  This seemingly minor geographical detail is a common point of confusion, highlighting the importance of precise geographical knowledge.  The statement attempts to mislead by altering the country of location.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text mentions the Indian national flag being unfurled at the Uhuru Summit, not Mawenzi Peak.  These are distinct peaks on Mount Kilimanjaro. The question uses a similar-sounding but incorrect peak name to create a plausible distractor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Lipulekh Pass does significantly reduce travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, its location is specified as Uttarakhand (Pithorgarh district), not Himachal Pradesh.  The statement attempts to mislead with an incorrect state. The pass facilitates trade with China, not Bhutan.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that Indian traders are demanding the resumption of border trade through the Lipulekh Pass, which was temporarily closed during the COVID-19 pandemic. This indicates that while the pass offers a significant advantage for pilgrimage, the border trade aspect remains a point of contention.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This fundamental geographical error is a significant distractor. The shortest maritime route is between Asia and Europe, not Europe and North America.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.  The provided text mentions a shift in fuel exports due to the situation, but doesn't specify increased canal tolls as the sole reason.  Other factors might have been involved, making this statement an oversimplification.  The question attempts to mislead by focusing on one possible cause while ignoring others.



**5. With reference to the Galkynysh gas field, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Galkynysh gas field is located 75 km southeast of Mary, Turkmenistan, not 100 km southeast of Ashgabat, and it's among the world's *five* largest, not ten. This demonstrates the importance of precise numerical and geographical detail.  The question uses slightly altered figures to create confusion.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the TAPI pipeline does originate from the Galkynysh gas field and transport natural gas to India via Afghanistan and Pakistan, its total length is approximately 1,800 km, not 1,500 km.  Again, a minor numerical alteration is used as a distractor.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

Statement 1 is partially correct in that the summit aimed to find a path to peace, but it didn't focus solely on direct negotiations between Russia and Ukraine. The aim was broader, encompassing a common understanding of a path towards just and lasting peace, involving various stakeholders and approaches.  The question tries to oversimplify the summit's objective.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India *abstained* from signing the joint communique, advocating for practical engagement through dialogue but not endorsing a specific framework.  This highlights India's nuanced approach to the conflict and its preference for a non-aligned stance.


**7. With reference to MERCOSUR, consider the following statements:**

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Gulf of Aden is located between the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea, forming a crucial maritime link between these two bodies of water.  The Mediterranean Sea is geographically distant.

Statement 2 is correct. The Gulf of Aden is a vital global shipping route, carrying a significant volume of international trade. Its strategic location makes it a crucial waterway for global commerce.  The high volume of shipping makes it vulnerable to piracy and other security threats.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is located in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  A recent survey revealed a significantly lower fish potential compared to previous assessments, raising concerns about its ecological health.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  While it's described as the largest *permanent* desert lake, the phrasing "world's largest permanent desert lake" is not universally agreed upon and other lakes might be contenders depending on specific criteria.  However, the core location information is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that a recent survey revealed *high* fish potential, contradicting the claim of significantly lower potential. The survey, after a 50-year gap, highlighted a positive finding regarding fish stocks. This directly refutes statement 2.  The question plays on the potential misconception that long periods without surveys would automatically imply a decline in resources.

**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a dormant stratovolcano located in Kenya, known for its unique ecosystem and biodiversity.
2.  Its Uhuru Peak is the highest point in Africa and represents a significant challenge for mountaineers due to its altitude and diverse terrain.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano, it is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. The text clearly specifies Tanzania as its location.  The description of its ecosystem is accurate, but the incorrect location makes the entire statement false.  The question uses a plausible but inaccurate detail (Kenya instead of Tanzania) to create a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct.  Uhuru Peak on Mount Kilimanjaro is accurately identified as the highest point in Africa and the phrasing accurately reflects the challenges faced by mountaineers. This statement aligns precisely with the information provided in the source text.

**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. It is a strategically important mountain pass located at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan, facilitating trade and pilgrimage.
2.  The closure of the Lipulekh Pass during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly impacted the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, leading to a prolonged disruption of traditional trade routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The text clearly states this geographical location.  The question subtly alters a key geographical fact to create a plausible but incorrect statement. The mention of trade and pilgrimage is correct, but the incorrect country inclusion negates the entire statement.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the closure of the Lipulekh Pass during the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.  The disruption of traditional trade routes is a logical consequence of this closure, making the statement accurate.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal Route, consider the following statements:**

1. The recent shift in India's fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route is primarily due to increased piracy concerns in the Suez Canal.
2. The Suez Canal, located in Egypt, serves as the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe, significantly reducing travel time for commercial shipping.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage does not mention increased piracy as the reason for shifting fuel exports from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope.  While piracy is a potential concern in some maritime routes, the text does not link it to this specific shift. The question introduces a plausible but unsubstantiated reason to confuse the examinee.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately describes the Suez Canal's location in Egypt and its significance as the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe, resulting in reduced travel time for commercial vessels. This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information given.



**5. With reference to the BIMSTEC Charter, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, grants the organization legal personality under international law, enhancing its effectiveness in regional cooperation.
2.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2023 marked the final step in its implementation, leading to immediate significant increases in trade volume among member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the BIMSTEC Charter, signed and adopted in 2022, grants the organization legal personality.  This is a key fact about the charter's significance.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Nepal's ratification was crucial for the charter's entry into force (in May 2024, not 2023), the passage makes no claim about immediate, significant increases in trade volume following this event.  The question introduces a causal link that is not supported by the provided text, serving as a distractor.  The effect on trade would be a longer-term outcome, not an immediate one.


**6. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Strengthening the Quad Act," recently passed by the US House of Representatives, aims to significantly increase military cooperation among Quad members, including joint military exercises and intelligence sharing.
2. The Wilmington Declaration, adopted at the recent Quad Leaders' Summit, included initiatives on combating cervical cancer and developing sustainable port infrastructure.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage mentions the "Strengthening the Quad Act," but doesn't specify its focus on increased military cooperation, joint exercises, or intelligence sharing.  The question infers a specific aspect of the act that is not explicitly stated in the provided text.

The Wilmington Declaration is explicitly mentioned, and the passage correctly lists initiatives on combating cervical cancer ("Quad Cancer Moonshot") and sustainable port infrastructure ("Quad Ports of the Future Partnership") as key announcements.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**7. With reference to India’s measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, form the core legislative framework for combating money laundering and terrorist financing in India.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies, but lacks the power to initiate investigations independently.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly identifies the PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, as key legislative frameworks in India's fight against money laundering and terrorist financing.

Statement 2 is also correct. The FIU-IND's role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence is accurately described. The statement correctly points out that the FIU-IND doesn't have independent investigation powers; its role is primarily intelligence gathering and dissemination to other investigative agencies.


**8. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report highlights that cocaine is the most widely abused drug globally, followed by cannabis and opioids, indicating a significant shift in drug consumption patterns compared to previous years.
2.  The report identifies the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Golden Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) as major drug production and trafficking hubs, posing significant challenges to regional security.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report actually states that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids. Cocaine is mentioned, but not as the most widely abused substance. The question deliberately misrepresents the order of drug abuse prevalence to create a misleading distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The report accurately identifies the "Triple Frontier Area" and the "Golden Triangle" (now referred to as the "Death Triangle") as major drug production and trafficking regions, highlighting their importance in the global drug trade and the associated security concerns.


**9. With reference to India-Vietnam relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The bilateral relationship between India and Vietnam was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2007, signifying a significant deepening of cooperation in various sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the relationship was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2016, not 2007.  The question manipulates the year to create a misleading option.  The initial "Strategic Partnership" was established in 2007, but the question incorrectly attributes the "Comprehensive" designation to that earlier year.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately identifies PASSEX, VINBAX, and MILAN as joint military exercises and mentions the handover of the missile corvette as an example of defense cooperation.  This statement is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.


**10. With reference to India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), signed in 2010, has significantly reduced the trade deficit between India and Malaysia, leading to a balanced trade relationship.
2.  Malaysia's decision to join the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA) reflects the growing collaboration between the two countries in wildlife conservation and environmental protection.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage mentions the CECA but does *not* state that it has reduced the trade deficit to a balanced state.  India still has a trade deficit with Malaysia, as the text indicates.  The question creates a false implication of a balanced trade relationship following the CECA.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Malaysia joined the IBCA, demonstrating collaboration in wildlife conservation. This statement accurately reflects the information provided.


**11. With reference to the IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITDB, operational since 1995, reports a steady decline in incidents of nuclear material theft globally, indicating improved security measures and international cooperation.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that the ITDB reported 168 incidents in 2023, which does not indicate a steady decline. The question creates a false narrative of decreasing incidents of nuclear material theft.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero initiatives and their goals related to food security and sustainable energy, aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.

2. Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first counter-narcotics operation conducted by the Indian Navy under CMF, highlights India's growing commitment to regional maritime security and counter-terrorism efforts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India's participation in CMF contributes to maritime security, the passage does not provide data on a significant reduction in piracy incidents specifically attributable to India's involvement. The question infers a causal link not explicitly supported by the text.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions Operation Crimson Barracuda as the first such operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining CMF in 2022, highlighting India's commitment to regional maritime security.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.


**13. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA, signed in 2009, has successfully eliminated all trade barriers between ASEAN member states and India, resulting in significantly increased trade volumes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers but doesn't claim that it has eliminated *all* barriers.  India also has a trade deficit with ASEAN, implying that the goal of eliminating all barriers has not been fully achieved. The question creates a false claim of complete barrier removal.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes the purpose of the 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA, focusing on reviewing progress and addressing challenges related to trade barriers and economic ties.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the provided information.


**14. With reference to the SAARC Currency Swap Framework, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage mentions the announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework and its intended purpose of facilitating cross-border payments, which implicitly suggests a reduction in reliance on the US dollar.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the PGII aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 and focuses on developing nations, it does *not* solely focus on renewable energy projects.  The passage mentions sustainable and inclusive infrastructure broadly, not just renewable energy.  The question creates an overly specific and incorrect limitation on the PGII's scope.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions the PGII and its relationship with other G7 initiatives, including the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, highlighting the complementary nature of these efforts.


**16. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1. NAM's recent call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" reflects NAM's commitment to multilateralism and opposition to unilateral sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage accurately reflects NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US list and links this action to NAM's principles of multilateralism and opposition to unilateral sanctions.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The passage does not claim that the US list only includes countries with demonstrably *clear* evidence of supporting terrorism.  The process of inclusion on such lists can be complex and involve varying levels of evidence, making the statement an oversimplification.  The question creates a false assumption about the criteria for inclusion on the US list.


**17. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth is primarily financial, as it is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth's budget.
2.  India's hosting of the CHOGM in 1983 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010 showcased India's commitment to the Commonwealth and its values.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states that India is the largest *member* (by population) and the fourth largest *contributor* (not the largest financial contributor) to the Commonwealth. The question misrepresents India's contribution by emphasizing financial contribution over its population size and overall contribution.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately mentions India's hosting of both the CHOGM and the Commonwealth Games, highlighting India's commitment to the Commonwealth.


**18. With reference to Australia, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Australia has significant arid areas, it is not the world's driest continent.  Antarctica holds that distinction. The question uses a common misconception about Australia's climate to create a distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately identifies the Murray River as Australia's longest river and its importance for agriculture and settlements.  This is a direct and accurate reflection of the information provided.


**19. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) established in 2020 between India and Australia primarily focuses on economic cooperation and trade, with defense and security aspects playing a secondary role.
2.  The Australia-India Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative Partnership (AIIPOIP) exemplifies the growing collaboration between India and Australia in maritime security and the management of shared ocean resources in the Indo-Pacific region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While economic cooperation is a part of the CSP, the passage clearly emphasizes the significant role of defense and security cooperation, making the statement's prioritization inaccurate. The question misrepresents the balance of focus within the CSP.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the AIIPOIP and its focus on maritime security and shared ocean resources in the Indo-Pacific, accurately reflecting the information provided.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII aims to mobilize funding for infrastructure projects in *developing* nations, not developed ones.  The focus is on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development to support economic growth and reduce poverty in these countries.  The target funding amount of $600 billion by 2027 is accurate. The statement incorrectly specifies the target recipient countries.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is indeed a G7-led effort designed to attract foreign investment for clean energy projects across the African continent. This initiative recognizes the crucial role of clean energy in Africa's sustainable development and aims to address energy poverty and promote economic growth through sustainable energy solutions.  The statement accurately reflects the initiative's goals and leadership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF did adopt India's MER, assessing the country's efforts against money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it was India's *first* MER, adopted in 2010, not the second.  The statement incorrectly states the number of MERs adopted for India.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND was indeed established in 2004 and plays a crucial role in India's fight against money laundering by collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies. The statement accurately identifies the establishment year and the role of this important institution.

(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Colombo Process is a broader regional cooperation framework addressing various issues related to migration management in the Asia-Pacific region, not limited to maritime security. While maritime security is a component, it also deals with issues like human trafficking, smuggling, and irregular migration. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the Colombo Process.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text explicitly states that India recently chaired its first meeting as the Chair of the Colombo Process. This highlights India's growing role in regional cooperation and its commitment to addressing migration-related challenges in the Asia-Pacific region.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 was 159 out of 180 countries, which is *lower* than 160. The statement provides an inaccurate ranking for India.

Statement 2 is correct. The WPFI is indeed published annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based NGO, and the publication date coincides with World Press Freedom Day, celebrated on May 3rd. The statement accurately reflects the publisher, the publication date, and the organization's role in advocating for press freedom.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC):**

1. The ASEAN+3 mechanism comprises 10 ASEAN member states plus Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the United States.
2. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), signed in 2009, aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India, resulting in a consistent trade surplus for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASEAN+3 mechanism includes the ten ASEAN member states along with Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, and Russia. The United States is *not* a member of ASEAN+3. The statement correctly lists the members, except for the erroneous inclusion of the US.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers and strengthen economic ties, India consistently experiences a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus. The statement incorrectly describes the nature of India's trade balance with ASEAN.

**10. With reference to the  United States (US), consider the following statements:**

1. The Mississippi River is the second-longest river in the US, and the Great Lakes (Superior, Michigan, Huron, Erie, and Ontario) are located entirely within the US borders.
2. The Rocky Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains are prominent mountain ranges in the US, and the Mojave Desert is the largest desert in the US.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Mississippi River is indeed the longest river in the US.  The Great Lakes are *not* entirely within US borders; they are shared with Canada. The statement contains two inaccuracies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Rocky Mountains and Appalachian Mountains are prominent mountain ranges in the US, the Mojave Desert is *not* the largest desert in the US; that distinction belongs to the Great Basin Desert. The statement contains one inaccuracy.


**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGII was launched in 2021 with the primary aim of mobilizing $500 billion by 2025 for infrastructure projects in developing countries.
2.  The initiative focuses solely on large-scale energy projects, prioritizing renewable energy sources over fossil fuels.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021, and aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not $500 billion by 2025.  The target funding is significantly higher and the timeframe is longer than stated.  While infrastructure development is the core focus, the statement's specification of the timeframe and funding amount is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII's focus is broader than solely energy projects. While sustainable infrastructure is a key component, it encompasses various sectors beyond energy, including transportation, digital connectivity, and water management.  The statement incorrectly limits the initiative's scope and prioritization to only renewable energy.  The PGII aims for sustainable and inclusive infrastructure development, which may incorporate a mix of energy sources depending on the specific project needs and environmental considerations.  Therefore, neither statement accurately reflects the PGII's characteristics.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM):**

1.  NAM's primary objective is to promote military alliances between developing nations to counter the influence of major powers.
2.  Cuba's inclusion on the US's unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism' has garnered significant support from NAM member states, leading to collective diplomatic action.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAM's core principle is non-alignment, meaning it avoids formal military alliances with either the US or the Soviet Union (and later, other major powers).  The movement emphasizes independence in foreign policy and promotes peaceful coexistence among nations. The statement incorrectly characterizes NAM as promoting military alliances.

Statement 2 is correct. NAM's stance against Cuba's inclusion on the US list reflects its concern for the sovereignty and interests of developing nations. The fact that  NAM members have voiced support for Cuba's removal highlights the movement's importance to Global South countries, who see the US list as an unfair and coercive measure.  This showcases NAM's collective action in addressing issues relevant to its members' interests, even if it does not always lead to direct or unified diplomatic actions.


**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth, exceeding all other member states combined.
2.  The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, is exclusively focused on promoting sustainable agriculture practices in Commonwealth nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is the largest member by population (representing nearly 60% of the total), it is not the largest financial contributor.  The statement misrepresents India's role within the Commonwealth, conflating population size with financial contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window, while operating under the India-UN Development Fund, has a broader mandate than solely sustainable agriculture.  It supports various development projects across multiple sectors within Commonwealth nations. The statement wrongly restricts the Sub Window's activities to a single area of focus.


**4. With reference to India's measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, was enacted before the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND).
2.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established specifically to combat money laundering, its mandate exclusively focused on this aspect since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, was enacted before the establishment of the FIU-IND in 2004.  The statement correctly reflects the chronological order of the establishment of these two crucial institutions in India's anti-money laundering framework.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ED plays a significant role in combating money laundering, its mandate is broader than that.  Established in 1956, the ED initially focused on foreign exchange regulation before its role expanded to include enforcement of various laws, including those related to money laundering.  The statement incorrectly asserts that the ED's mandate was exclusively focused on money laundering from its inception.


**5.  With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1.  The report identifies the Golden Triangle (now renamed Death Triangle) as the region with the highest production and trafficking of cocaine.
2.  The report highlights the legalization of cannabis in several countries as a significant factor influencing global drug trends.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Golden Triangle (Death Triangle) is primarily associated with the production and trafficking of opium and heroin, not cocaine.  Cocaine production is concentrated in other regions, such as South America. The statement incorrectly attributes cocaine production to the Golden Triangle.

Statement 2 is correct. The report acknowledges the legalization of cannabis in some jurisdictions as a significant development affecting global drug trends, including its impact on patterns of consumption, production, and trafficking.  The statement accurately reflects a key aspect of the UNODC's analysis.


**6.  With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programs, consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses on promoting nuclear energy to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
2.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to the theft of highly enriched uranium.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The Atoms4NetZero program is indeed focused on promoting nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source to help achieve net-zero emissions. This is a key element of the IAEA's efforts to address climate change.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ITDB tracks incidents involving a broader range of nuclear and other radioactive materials, not just highly enriched uranium. It monitors and reports on illicit trafficking of various nuclear materials, encompassing a wide spectrum of isotopes and forms. The statement incorrectly limits the database's scope to a single type of material.


**7. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7) Summit, consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 has a permanent secretariat located in Brussels, Belgium, responsible for coordinating the group's activities throughout the year.
2. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while not directly led by the G7, has received substantial financial and technical support from G7 nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure or secretariat. Its presidency rotates annually among member states, setting the agenda for that year. The statement incorrectly describes the G7's organizational structure.

Statement 2 is correct.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while not directly a G7-led initiative in the sense of having a G7-based governing body, receives significant support, both financial and technical, from G7 member nations. This reflects the G7's commitment to sustainable development and energy access in Africa.


**8. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC entered into force in 1993, immediately following its adoption in 1992.
2.  The CWC includes provisions for on-site inspections of declared chemical weapons facilities and research programs to verify compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC was adopted in 1992, but it entered into force in 1997, not 1993.  There is a time lag between the adoption of a treaty and its coming into force as various states need to ratify it. The statement misrepresents the timeline for the CWC's implementation.

Statement 2 is correct. The CWC's verification regime is a cornerstone of the treaty, including detailed provisions for on-site inspections of declared facilities to ensure compliance.  This is a critical aspect of the CWC's effectiveness.


**9.  With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).
2.  The INCB's primary function is to monitor the implementation of the three UN drug control conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the INCB is an independent body within the UN system, it is not a subsidiary of the UNODC. It has its own distinct mandate and operational structure. The statement misrepresents the INCB's relationship with the UNODC.

Statement 2 is correct. The INCB's core function is to monitor the implementation of the three UN drug control conventions (the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961, the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971, and the UN Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988).  This is a central aspect of its work.


**10. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2023, marking a significant step towards strengthening regional cooperation.
2.  BIMSTEC's focus areas primarily include trade, security, and environmental issues, with less emphasis on social development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC charter came into force on May 20, 2024, not in 2023. The statement incorrectly states the year the charter came into force.

Statement 2 is partially correct, although it is an oversimplification. While trade, security, and environmental issues are prominent, BIMSTEC also addresses areas like agriculture, food security, people-to-people contact, science and technology, and connectivity.  The statement underestimates the breadth of BIMSTEC's focus areas.  It is more accurate to say that BIMSTEC has a multi-sectoral approach, encompassing both economic and social development goals.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1.  Lake Turkana is located in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  The primary water source for Lake Turkana is the Omo River, located in Ethiopia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  It holds the distinction of being the largest permanent desert lake globally, and the fourth largest lake in Africa. The description emphasizes its location and unique characteristic as a desert lake, vital information for geographical understanding.

Statement 2 is also correct. The Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the main source of water for Lake Turkana. This hydrological connection is crucial for understanding the lake's ecosystem and its dependence on the river's flow.  The statement correctly identifies the river and its origin, highlighting the transboundary nature of the water resource. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately represent the geographical and hydrological facts about Lake Turkana.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Kenya and is the highest peak in Africa.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro is considered the largest free-standing mountain in the world, composed primarily of granite.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa, its location is in Tanzania, not Kenya.  The error in the location is a significant geographical inaccuracy that makes the statement incorrect.  Furthermore, it is a stratovolcano, composed of ash, lava, and rock, not primarily granite.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  Mount Kilimanjaro is widely recognized as the largest free-standing mountain globally.  The description of its composition as primarily granite is inaccurate; it's a stratovolcano made of ash, lava, and rock. However, the core statement regarding its free-standing nature remains accurate and is a key characteristic for understanding its geological uniqueness.  Therefore, only statement 2 contains a largely correct assertion.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, and facilitates trade between India and Nepal.
2.  The Lipulekh Pass is situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand and significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the Lipulekh Pass is indeed near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, it does not facilitate trade between India and Nepal. The statement incorrectly substitutes Bhutan for Nepal in the tri-junction description and misrepresents the pass's function.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass is accurately located in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand and significantly shortens the travel duration for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.  The statement correctly identifies the location and significance of the pass for the pilgrimage, which is a crucial aspect of its importance.  The accuracy of the location and its impact on pilgrimage travel time make this statement correct.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, thereby shortening the maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2.  Recently, India shifted a portion of its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route due to geopolitical concerns.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This fundamental geographical error renders the statement incorrect.  The statement also oversimplifies the impact on maritime routes; while it does shorten the distance, the statement lacks nuance about the complexities of global shipping.

Statement 2 is correct.  Recent geopolitical developments have indeed led India to reroute some of its fuel exports to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope route, instead of the Suez Canal.  This is a significant development in international trade and reflects the impact of geopolitical factors on shipping routes.  The statement accurately reflects this shift, highlighting the strategic implications for trade.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Rwanda is a landlocked country in Central Africa; it does not border Lake Victoria.  The description of Rwanda as a coastal country is a major geographical inaccuracy.

The statement accurately captures the significance of NAM's action within the broader geopolitical context.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The US list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism' is not limited to countries with definitively proven direct involvement in terrorist acts.  Allegations and perceived support, even if indirect, can lead to inclusion.  This is a key difference between the US's unilateral approach and the multilateral approach advocated by NAM. The inaccuracies in statement 2 effectively serve as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the complexities of international relations and the nuances of the US's counter-terrorism policies.

**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to primarily fund infrastructure projects in high-income countries to stimulate global economic growth.
2.  The G7 operates under a fixed, permanent organizational structure, ensuring consistent policy implementation across its member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII's explicit goal is to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* nations.  The initiative is designed to address infrastructure gaps in these countries, promoting sustainable and inclusive development.  Focusing solely on high-income countries would contradict the core purpose of the PGII.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The G7 operates under a rotating presidency system, meaning there's no fixed, permanent structure.  Each member nation holds the presidency for a year, setting the agenda and priorities for that period. This rotating system influences the consistency of policy implementation, as priorities shift with each new presidency.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) primarily tracks incidents related to the theft of nuclear weapons, rather than other nuclear materials.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear technologies to enhance agricultural productivity and improve food security globally.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB's scope is broader than just nuclear weapons.  It monitors and reports on illicit trafficking of *all* forms of nuclear material, including materials that could be used to create weapons but also those with other applications.  The database captures a wide range of incidents involving unauthorized acquisition, movement, or possession of nuclear materials.

Statement 2 is correct. The Atoms4Food program is a key IAEA initiative that leverages nuclear techniques to improve agricultural practices. These techniques are used to enhance crop yields, improve livestock breeding, and develop more resilient farming methods, ultimately contributing to improved food security and nutrition globally. The program actively applies nuclear science to address global food challenges.


**6.  With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following statements:**

1. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 assesses only the technical aspects of cybersecurity infrastructure, neglecting policy and legal frameworks.
2.  India's placement in Tier 1 of the GCI 2024 signifies its strong commitment to all five pillars of cybersecurity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 takes a holistic approach, evaluating not just technical aspects but also legal and policy frameworks related to cybersecurity.  The index considers various factors contributing to a nation's overall cybersecurity posture, including legal frameworks, technical capabilities, and the implementation of cybersecurity strategies.  The assessment isn't limited to purely technical considerations.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's ranking in Tier 1 indicates a strong commitment to all five pillars of cybersecurity as defined by the ITU. This signifies a comprehensive approach to cybersecurity, encompassing policy, legal, and technical aspects.  The Tier 1 designation reflects India's robust efforts in this critical domain.


**7. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil from India to Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia. However, it also states that India is the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  This subtle difference makes statement 1 partially incorrect.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports High Speed Diesel (HSD), not crude oil.  This factual inaccuracy renders the statement false. The pipeline is a significant component of energy cooperation between the two nations, but the transported fuel is HSD, not crude oil.


**8. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner globally.
2. The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore has resulted in a trade surplus for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner for India, it's not India's largest trading partner *globally*.  The text specifies that Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN and its 6th largest globally.  This makes statement 1 factually inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India is a *net importer* under the CECA.  A net importer indicates a trade deficit (more imports than exports), not a surplus.  This makes statement 2 incorrect.


**9. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first anti-piracy operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF.
2. The CMF is primarily focused on countering terrorism and protecting maritime trade routes in the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation, not an anti-piracy operation, conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF.  The operation focused on countering drug trafficking, a different area of maritime security than anti-piracy.

Statement 2 is correct. The CMF's primary objective is indeed to counter terrorism and safeguard maritime trade routes within its operational area, which includes a significant portion of the Indian Ocean region.  The forces work collaboratively to enhance maritime security, and the focus is on counter-terrorism and protection of sea lanes.


**10. With reference to the  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces, including the authority to arrest and detain individuals without a warrant within designated areas.
2. AFSPA has been permanently repealed across all states and union territories of India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AFSPA grants wide-ranging powers to the armed forces in designated areas.  These powers include the authority to arrest and detain individuals without a warrant, conduct searches without warrants, and use force, even lethal force, in certain circumstances. The act's provisions are designed to enhance the armed forces' ability to maintain order and security in areas experiencing disturbances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AFSPA has not been permanently repealed across India.  The act remains in effect in certain areas, where it is extended periodically based on security assessments. The continued application of the act in specific regions highlights the ongoing security challenges faced in those areas.
