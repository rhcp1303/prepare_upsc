2.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
3.  India and the UK have signed an agreement to enhance collaboration in health and life sciences.
4.  The US has imposed sanctions on India under the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA).

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text mentions the agreement between India and China for disengagement in Depsang Plains and Demchok areas.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Bangladesh is a significant trading partner, the text states that it is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, not globally.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the agreement between India and the UK to strengthen collaboration in health and life sciences.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the text mentions the CAATSA and potential sanctions, it clarifies that the US House of Representatives passed an amendment exempting India from sanctions related to the S-400 purchase.  The text does not indicate that sanctions were actually imposed.


**7. Consider the following international organizations and their mandates:**

1.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering.
2.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) focuses solely on combating drug trafficking.
3.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) prohibits the development and use of chemical weapons.
4.  The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is primarily concerned with nuclear non-proliferation.


Which of the above statements correctly describe the mandates of the respective organizations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that FATF assesses measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While UNODC is heavily involved in combating drug trafficking, its mandate is broader, encompassing various aspects of crime prevention and criminal justice, as indicated in the text.

Statement 3 is correct.  The text mentions the CWC's prohibition on the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The INCB's mandate, as implied in the text by its focus on international drug control, is not related to nuclear non-proliferation.  That falls under different international bodies like the IAEA.


**8. Consider the following regarding India's defense agreements and partnerships:**

1.  India is a member of the Five Eyes alliance.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) enhances defense cooperation between India and the US.

Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text does not mention India being a part of the Five Eyes alliance.  This alliance comprises Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK, and the US.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions LEMOA as a defense cooperation agreement between India and the US.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While COMCASA deals with communication security, its primary focus is not solely on cybersecurity.  It relates more to interoperability of defense communication systems.

Statement 4 is correct. The text confirms India's participation in Malabar exercises alongside Australia, Japan, and the US.


**9. Consider the following statements about SAARC and its initiatives:**

1.  Decisions within SAARC are made by consensus.
2.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) is a key SAARC initiative.

4.  SAARC has remained highly effective in recent years.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text clearly states that SAARC decisions are taken unanimously.

Statement 2 is correct.  SAFTA is explicitly mentioned as a key SAARC initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text indicates that the SAARC Food Bank was established in 2007, not 2006.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that SAARC has been largely dysfunctional since 2016.  This directly contradicts the statement.


**10. Consider the following statements related to the G7 and its initiatives:**

1.  The G7 has a permanent, fixed structure.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative focused on infrastructure projects in developing nations.
3.  India is a permanent member of the G7.
4.  The G7's rotating Presidency sets the annual agenda.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that the G7 lacks a permanent structure; its presidency rotates.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text mentions the PGII as a G7 initiative designed to fund infrastructure in developing countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India is not a permanent member; it was invited as an Outreach Country for the 50th summit.  The G7 comprises seven leading industrialized nations.

Statement 4 is correct.  The text confirms that the rotating G7 Presidency sets the annual agenda.


1. Consider the following statements regarding India's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing:

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004.
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal was launched in 2022 to facilitate international cooperation.
4. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF was first adopted in 2010 and assesses measures to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures.  The PMLA, 2002, forms the cornerstone of the legal framework.  The FIU-IND plays a crucial role in gathering and disseminating financial intelligence. The MLAT Portal enhances international collaboration in investigations.  Finally, the FATF's MER process, first conducted in 2010 for India, explicitly includes an assessment of measures to counter the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, alongside money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, there are no incorrect statements.


2. Consider the following regarding the UNODC's World Drug Day Report:

1.  Amphetamines are among the most abused drugs globally.
2.  The "Golden Triangle" region, now termed the "Death Triangle," includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.
3.  The "Golden Crescent," now called the "Death Crescent," encompasses Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
4.  Cannabis is legalized in several US jurisdictions, Uruguay, and Canada.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the report's findings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The UNODC report highlights amphetamines as a significant drug of abuse, making statement 1 correct. The renaming of the "Golden Triangle" and "Golden Crescent" regions to "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent," respectively, to emphasize their roles in drug trafficking is also accurate (statements 2 and 3). The legalization of cannabis in various locations, including parts of the US, Uruguay, and Canada, is a documented fact (statement 4). Thus, all four statements align with the UNODC report's key findings.


3. Consider the following statements related to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention):

1.  It is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003.
2.  India has not ratified the UNTOC.
3.  The UNODC serves as the secretariat for UNTOC.
4.  The UNTOC focuses solely on combating drug trafficking.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct: The UN Convention Against Corruption indeed supplements the UNTOC. Statement 3 is also correct: The UNODC acts as the secretariat for UNTOC. However, statement 2 is incorrect:  India *has* ratified the UNTOC. Statement 4 is also incorrect:  The UNTOC has a broader scope than just drug trafficking; it addresses various forms of transnational organized crime.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


4. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international organizations:

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
3. India's role in the Group of Seven (G7) is as a permanent member.
4. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention.


How many of the above statements accurately describe India's international affiliations and commitments?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  India's membership in SAWEN (statement 1) and the SCO (statement 2) is well-documented.  India's participation in the G7 is as an invited guest or "Outreach Country," not as a permanent member (statement 3 is incorrect).  India is indeed a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (statement 4 is correct). Therefore, three of the statements are correct.


5. Consider the following initiatives related to combating terrorism:

1.  The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy aims to enhance national and international efforts.
2.  India contributed to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund to support programs like Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT).
3.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has a regional anti-terrorist structure.
4.  The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund was established in 2017.


How many of these statements accurately reflect global counter-terrorism measures?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate descriptions of global counter-terrorism initiatives. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is a key framework.  India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund is a known fact.  The SCO's regional anti-terrorist structure also exists. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund was established in 2009, not 2017.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


6. Consider the following about the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):

1.  It was signed in 2009.
2.  Its objective is to deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India.
3.  India has a trade surplus with ASEAN.
4.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting recently reviewed AITIGA.


How many of the above statements regarding AITIGA are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe aspects of AITIGA.  The agreement was indeed signed in 2009.  Its aim is to reduce trade barriers and strengthen economic ties.  A 5th Joint Committee Meeting for reviewing the agreement is also mentioned in the source.  However, statement 3 is incorrect: India has a trade *deficit*, not a surplus, with ASEAN.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


7. Consider the following regarding India's currency swap agreements (CSAs):

1.  A CSA is a contract for exchanging currencies at a set rate with a future re-exchange.
2.  India has a CSA with Japan amounting to $75 billion.
3.  India's CSA with Sri Lanka is insignificant compared to other CSAs.
4.  SAARC's currency swap framework for 2024-2027 was recently announced by the RBI.


How many of the above statements regarding India's CSAs are accurate?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  A CSA functions as described in statement 1. The India-Japan CSA is indeed a significant agreement, as stated in statement 2.  The RBI's announcement of a SAARC currency swap framework for 2024-2027 is also accurate (statement 4).  However, statement 3 is subjective and potentially misleading; while the size of the India-Sri Lanka CSA might be smaller than others,  labeling it "insignificant" is an opinion, not a factual statement.  Therefore, three statements are factually correct.


8. Consider the following regarding India-US relations:

1.  India is the 18th partner in the US's State Sponsor of Terrorism list.
2.  India and the US have a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA).
3.  India has a trade surplus with the US.
4.  The Malabar exercises involve India, Australia, Japan, and US forces.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-US relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The LEMOA is a key defense agreement.  India does have a trade surplus with the US. The Malabar exercises include the participation of the four nations mentioned. However, statement 1 is incorrect; India is not on the US's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.  Therefore, three statements are accurate.


9. Consider the following international organizations and their activities:

1.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) operates an Incident and Trafficking Database.
2.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
3.  The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) includes India as a member.
4.  The Universal Postal Union (UPU) recently celebrated its 100th anniversary.


How many of the above statements are accurate representations of the respective organizations' actions or status?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The IAEA does maintain the ITDB.  The ITU released the GCI 2024. India's membership in the CMF is also accurate. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the UPU celebrated its 150th, not 100th, anniversary.  Therefore, three statements are correct.


10. Consider the following concerning India's domestic policies and agreements:

1.  The Bru-Reang Agreement resolved a long-standing displacement issue in Tripura and Mizoram.
2.  The Karbi Anglong Agreement addressed an ethnic conflict in Assam.
3.  The NLFT Peace Accord involved the surrender and reintegration of an armed group in Nagaland.
4.  The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) has been completely repealed in all Northeast states.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect recent developments in India's Northeast region?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct descriptions of the Bru-Reang and Karbi Anglong agreements, respectively.  However, statement 3 is partially incorrect; while there was an NLFT Peace Accord, it involved Tripura, not Nagaland. Statement 4 is also incorrect: AFSPA remains in effect in parts of the Northeast.  Therefore, only two statements are completely accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and international relations,  designed to be challenging and assess various cognitive skills.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):**

1. IPEF's Supply Chain Council aims to strengthen critical supply chains.
2. The IPEF includes a Crisis Response Network for collective emergency responses to supply chain disruptions.
3. The IPEF's Labor Rights Advisory Board solely focuses on enhancing labor rights within participating nations.
4.  India holds the Vice-Chair position in IPEF's Supply Chain Council.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the IPEF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF). The IPEF indeed established a Supply Chain Council focused on strengthening critical supply chains, a Crisis Response Network to address disruptions, and India does hold a Vice-Chair position within the Supply Chain Council.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Labor Rights Advisory Board is a crucial part of the IPEF, its role extends beyond just enhancing labor rights within individual nations; it focuses on regional supply chain workforce development as well.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1. IMEC aims to enhance global connectivity.
2. IMEC is primarily a bilateral initiative between India and the European Union.
3.  The IMEC's primary focus is on energy security cooperation.
4. The IMEC's development was announced at the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave.

Which of the above statements are correct concerning the IMEC's objectives and context?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the IMEC is indeed positioned as a cornerstone of global connectivity. Statement 4 is also accurate, as the IMEC's significance was highlighted during the mentioned conclave.  However, statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.  While the IMEC involves partnerships with Middle Eastern and European nations, it's not solely a bilateral initiative between India and the EU. Also, while energy security is a relevant factor in regional trade corridors, it's not the IMEC's exclusive or primary focus.  The corridor encompasses a broader range of economic and logistical connections.


**3. Consider the following statements concerning the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1. Belarus's accession marks the SCO's expansion to ten member states.
2. The SCO's anti-terrorism cooperation program extends beyond 2025.
3.  India currently holds the rotating chairmanship of the SCO.
4. The SCO's Development Strategy has a timeframe exceeding 2030.

How many of these statements correctly describe recent developments or ongoing initiatives within the SCO?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. Belarus joining the SCO did increase the membership to ten, and the SCO's Development Strategy extends beyond 2030.  However, statement 2 is partially correct, but the phrasing is misleading. While the anti-terrorism program does continue beyond 2025, the provided timeframe (2025-2027) is for a specific program, not the entire anti-terrorism cooperation strategy. Statement 3 is incorrect; the question does not indicate who the current chairman is.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF assesses a country's measures to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) was first adopted in 2020.
3. The FATF's process involves peer review by its member states.
4.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework used by India to combat money laundering.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the FATF's functions and India's engagement with it?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The FATF's core function is assessing countermeasures for money laundering and terrorist financing; its process uses peer reviews, and the PMLA is a crucial Indian law in this context.  However, statement 2 is incorrect. The provided text states that India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2020.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1. Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.
2. The upcoming Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor connects Bihar and Assam.
3.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are primarily India-Bhutan initiatives.
4. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is primarily for transporting natural gas.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect South Asian energy cooperation initiatives?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The trilateral pact among Nepal, India, and Bangladesh is accurate, as is the description of the Katihar-Bornagar corridor. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Arun III and Upper Karnali are India-Nepal projects, not India-Bhutan. Statement 4 is also incorrect. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports petroleum products, not natural gas.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements related to India-China relations:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is fully demarcated.
2.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of its territory.
3. The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash since 1962.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-China relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. China's claim on Arunachal Pradesh is a well-known territorial dispute, and the Galwan clash is confirmed as the deadliest since 1962. Statement 3 is also correct.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the LAC is not fully demarcated.  Also, statement 4 is an oversimplification; while disengagement has occurred in some areas, it's not complete across all friction points.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's relations with Singapore:**

1. India and Singapore have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
2. Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN.
3.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) has resulted in a significant trade surplus for India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India-Singapore relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership is accurate, as is Singapore's position as India's largest trading partner in ASEAN. Project Nexus is also correctly described.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While CECA facilitates trade, India's trade balance with Singapore is not necessarily a significant surplus; the provided text does not state which country has a trade surplus. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following about the Group of Seven (G7):**

1. The G7 has a permanent, fixed structure.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) was launched in 2023.
3.  The G7's rotating Presidency sets the annual agenda.

How many of the statements accurately reflect the nature and functioning of the G7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 is correct. The rotating presidency sets the agenda. Statement 2 is incorrect;  the PGII was launched in 2022, not 2023. Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; India is an outreach country, not a permanent member. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**9. Consider the following statements about the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM):**

1.  The NAM advocates for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list.
2. The US's unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism' is legally binding on all UN member states.
3.  NAM's position on Cuba highlights its importance to Global South countries.
4.  Iran is not included in the US's unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism'.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the NAM's stance and the context of the US's unilateral terrorism list?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NAM's advocacy for Cuba's removal is accurate, as is the observation that this position reflects its importance to Global South nations. However, statement 2 is incorrect; the US list is not legally binding on other UN members. Statement 4 is also incorrect; Iran is included on that list.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Commonwealth:**

1. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth by population.
2.  The Commonwealth has a fixed, permanent Head.
3.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
4.  The Commonwealth is solely composed of former British colonies.

How many of these statements accurately describe the Commonwealth of Nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, are correct. India's large population within the Commonwealth and its hosting of the 2010 Games are accurate. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the monarch is the Head of the Commonwealth, the position is not fixed in perpetuity and is dependent on the reigning monarch. Statement 4 is also an oversimplification; while many members are former colonies, the Commonwealth includes countries that gained independence through other means or were never formally colonies.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging, requiring factual recall and analytical skills.  Plausible distractors are included to increase difficulty.

How many of the above statements are entirely accurate?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  SIPRI data confirms India's leading role in providing military personnel for UN peacekeeping operations in 2023.  Statement 3 is also correct; "Yudh Abhyas" is a well-established annual joint military exercise between India and the USA. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While Sub-Saharan Africa had the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023, the Middle East is also a significant region for such operations, but not the majority.  Statement 4 is incorrect; "Indra" is a bilateral military exercise between India and Russia, not France.  "Varuna" is the exercise conducted with France. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's relationships with its neighbors:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The "Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant" is a joint energy project between India and Nepal.

(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner within South Asia. Statement 3 is also correct; "Milan" is a joint military exercise between India and several countries including Bangladesh. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, not Nepal.

How many of the above statements are entirely correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; India is a signatory to and has enacted legislation regarding the CWC. Statement 2 is also correct; the FATF's role involves peer reviews of countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the "Kyoto Protocol" relates to climate change, not transnational organized crime.  The UNTOC is also known as the Palermo Convention. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India's first MER adoption by the FATF was in 2010, not 2015.  Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following about India's security apparatus and policies:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; AFSPA provides special powers to the armed forces in areas declared as "disturbed." Statement 2 is also correct; the Assam Accord primarily focused on illegal immigration and related citizenship questions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Shillong Accord was signed with the Naga National Council (NNC), not the MNF.  The Mizoram Peace Accord was signed with the MNF. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Andaman and Nicobar Command is a tri-service command, not solely under the Navy.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following regarding regional and international organizations:**

1. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) recently acquired legal personality.
2.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been fully functional since 2016.
3.  The "Quad" (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) recently held a leaders' summit in Wilmington, USA.
4.  The "Common Pledge Initiative" aims to increase women's participation in peace processes.

Which of the above statements are entirely correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is accurate; BIMSTEC's charter came into force, giving it legal personality. Statement 3 is also correct; the Quad leaders' summit was held in Wilmington.  Statement 4 is also accurate; the Common Pledge Initiative focuses on increasing women's roles in peace processes.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; SAARC has been largely dysfunctional since 2016, not fully functional. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are entirely correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding India's relations with other countries:**

1.  India and the Maldives recently signed a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA).
2.  The "Operation Neer" initiative provided medical assistance to the Maldives during a health crisis.
3.  India and the UK elevated their strategic partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) in 2020.
4.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has imposed significant sanctions on India for purchasing the S-400 missile system.


How many of the above statements are entirely correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct;  India and the Maldives did sign a CSA. However, statement 2 is incorrect; Operation Neer provided water during a crisis, not medical assistance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the elevation to CSP happened in 2021, not 2020. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while CAATSA was enacted, an amendment exempted India from sanctions related to the S-400 purchase.  Therefore, only one statement (1) is entirely correct.


**7. Consider the following features of the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS):**

1. The NSCS was established in 2000 based on the recommendations of a high-level committee.
2. The National Security Advisor (NSA) heads the Strategic Policy Group (SPG) within the NSCS.
3. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) provides short-term policy recommendations to the NSC.
4. The NSC comprises ministers from various key ministries, including Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the NSCS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; the NSA heads the SPG. Statement 4 is correct; the NSC includes ministers from the mentioned key ministries. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; the NSC was constituted in 1999, not 2000, based on the K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations. Statement 3 is incorrect; the NSAB provides long-term, not short-term, analysis and recommendations. Therefore, only three statements (2, 4, and the partially correct statement 1) are substantially accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning the United Nations Security Council (UNSC):**

1. The UNSC has the power to make binding decisions on member states.
2. India has served on the UNSC's non-permanent seat nine times.
3. The UNSC's budget and resources require approval from the General Assembly.
4. The Department of Peace Operations (DPO) of the UN provides logistical support to peacekeeping operations.


Which of the statements are entirely accurate descriptions of the UNSC's functions and operations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; UNSC resolutions are legally binding. Statement 3 is also correct; the General Assembly approves the UNSC's budget. Statement 2 is incorrect; India has been elected to the non-permanent seat eight times, not nine.  Statement 4 is partially incorrect; the DPO provides political and executive direction, not solely logistical support, to peacekeeping operations.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.


These questions demand in-depth knowledge of the subject matter and are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test the candidate's ability to discriminate between closely related facts.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires a deep understanding of the facts presented.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding international conventions related to weapons:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
3. The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
4.  The Geneva Conventions of 1949 primarily address the treatment of wounded and sick combatants and prisoners of war.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the focus and content of the respective international conventions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the core tenets of the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention, and the Rome Statute, respectively. The Biological Weapons Convention explicitly prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention similarly focuses on the elimination of chemical weapons.  The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for the gravest international crimes.

Statement 4 is partially correct but misleading in the context of the question.  While the Geneva Conventions of 1949 are crucial for international humanitarian law, their primary focus is broader than just the treatment of combatants and prisoners of war. They cover a range of issues related to the protection of civilians and the conduct of warfare.  This makes it an inaccurate distractor in a question focused on specific weapon conventions. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of accurate statements. Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracy of statement 4.


**2. Consider the following regarding the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and its reports:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses solely on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.
3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
4. The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme addresses the illicit trafficking of firearms.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the activities and reports of the UNODC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.  The UNODC's World Drug Report consistently highlights cannabis as one of the most widely abused substances globally.  The UNODC also serves as the secretariat for the UNTOC, providing support for its implementation. The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme is a key initiative to combat the illicit trafficking of firearms.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report does address illegal wildlife trade, its scope is global and not limited to Africa. This makes it a plausible distractor for someone with partial knowledge of the UNODC's work.  Only three statements are accurate, making (c) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international organizations:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWN).
2. India has been elected to the steering committee of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network.
3. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) was first adopted in 2015.
4. India contributed to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund to support programmes like Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Countering Terrorist Travel Programme (CTTP).


How many of the above statements correctly describe India's involvement in these organizations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect India's participation. India is indeed a member of SAWEN, a regional initiative to combat wildlife crime. India's election to the GlobE steering committee demonstrates its commitment to anti-corruption efforts.  India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund is a well-documented fact.

Statement 3 is incorrect; India's first MER adoption by the FATF was in 2010, not 2015. This subtle inaccuracy serves as a challenging distractor. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct, making (c) the correct answer.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces to operate in "disturbed areas" declared by the state governor or the central government.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, but not Jammu and Kashmir.
3. AFSPA provides immunity to armed forces personnel from legal proceedings without prior sanction from the central government.
4. The Shillong Accord (1975) directly led to the repeal of AFSPA in Nagaland.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding AFSPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and partially 2 are accurate. AFSPA does grant special powers in declared disturbed areas, with the declaration authority resting with either the state governor or the central government.  AFSPA also provides immunity from legal proceedings without prior central government sanction. AFSPA remains in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect because it omits the fact that a similar act, the Armed Forces (Jammu and Kashmir) Special Powers Act, 1990, grants similar powers in Jammu and Kashmir.  Statement 4 is false; the Shillong Accord did not lead to the repeal of AFSPA in Nagaland. Therefore, only three statements are wholly or partially accurate.


**5. Consider the following about the Commonwealth:**

1.  The Commonwealth is led by a rotating chairperson elected by member states.
2.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and the CHOGM in 1983.
3.  The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) focuses solely on promoting local governance within the UK.
4.  Barbados removed the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of the Commonwealth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate. India did host both the Commonwealth Games and the CHOGM in the years mentioned. Barbados did indeed become a republic in 2021, removing the British monarch as its head of state.

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Head of the Commonwealth is chosen by the member states, but it is not a rotating position.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the CLGF's scope extends beyond the UK to encompass local governance across Commonwealth countries.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.



These questions demand not just knowledge but the ability to discern subtle inaccuracies and misleading information – crucial skills for success in UPSC-style examinations.  Remember that the difficulty lies in the nuanced factual details and the plausible distractors.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, focusing on difficult questions with plausible distractors and detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 2004 to combat money laundering.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) plays a crucial role in information sharing.
4. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is a cornerstone legislation in India's fight against money laundering.  Statement 3 is also correct; the FIU-IND is a vital agency for collecting and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing. Statement 4 is accurate; the MLAT portal enhances international collaboration in investigations. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established much earlier, in 1956, not 2004.  Its mandate has expanded to include the enforcement of the PMLA, but its origins predate the specific focus on money laundering.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.  The inclusion of a factually close but incorrect date (2004 instead of 1956) serves as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge for accurate selection.


**2. Consider the following international conventions related to weapons:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention focuses on prohibiting the development and use of biological weapons.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
3. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for crimes against humanity but not war crimes.
4. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.

Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect the facts about the respective conventions and India's participation.  The Rome Statute (Statement 3) is inaccurate in stating that it *does not* address war crimes. In fact, the ICC's jurisdiction explicitly includes war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. This incorrect detail is a crucial distractor, requiring a thorough understanding of the Rome Statute's provisions.  The inclusion of India's specific action in ratifying and enacting legislation related to one of the conventions adds another layer of difficulty and necessitates precise knowledge of Indian legal frameworks.


**3. Consider the following international organizations and their activities:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts mutual evaluations of countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released the World Wildlife Crime Report, 2024.
3. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative to engage youth in crime prevention.
4. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) maintains a database on nuclear material theft incidents.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the mentioned organization's activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe the activities of the respective international organizations.  The inclusion of diverse organizations from different sectors (finance, drugs and crime, criminal justice, and nuclear energy) makes the question challenging.  The various activities described – mutual evaluation reports, wildlife crime reports, youth engagement initiatives, and nuclear material theft databases – are specific and require accurate recall of each organization's mandate and recent activities.  There are no obvious distractors; all options are plausible unless one has precise knowledge of each organization.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with international organizations:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India participated in the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) Annual Board meeting in Sri Lanka.
3. India was elected to the steering committee of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network.
4. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's engagement with these organizations?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe India's involvement with the specified organizations.  The question tests factual recall regarding India's participation in diverse multilateral forums, spanning wildlife conservation, local governance, anti-corruption efforts, and the Commonwealth. The range of organizations and their activities makes the question difficult, requiring precise recall of India's role in each.  No single statement is easily identifiable as incorrect; all are plausible unless the candidate possesses detailed knowledge of India's participation in these specific organizations and events.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" by the Central Government only.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Nagaland, Assam, Manipur, and Arunachal Pradesh.
3. The Shillong Accord (1975) aimed to end insurgency in Nagaland through negotiations with the Naga National Council (NNC).
4.  Legal proceedings against armed forces personnel under AFSPA require prior sanction from the state government.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Statement 1 is incorrect because the declaration of a "disturbed area" can be made by either the Governor of a state, the administrator of a Union Territory, or the Central Government.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; prior sanction for legal proceedings against armed forces personnel under AFSPA is required from the *Central*, not the state, government. The combination of slightly altered details (who declares "disturbed areas," and which government grants sanction for legal proceedings) makes the question challenging and tests precise knowledge of the AFSPA provisions.  The inclusion of a historically significant peace accord (Shillong Accord) further increases the difficulty level.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and international relations, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Commonwealth of Nations:**

1.  The Commonwealth is primarily an economic organization focused on free trade agreements.
2.  Decisions within the Commonwealth are made through a system of weighted voting, reflecting the economic power of its members.
3.  The head of the Commonwealth is elected by its member states.
4.  Queen Elizabeth II was the longest-serving head of the Commonwealth.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Commonwealth facilitates trade and economic cooperation, it is not primarily an economic organization.  Its focus is broader, encompassing political cooperation, cultural exchange, and shared values.  It does not have a focus on free trade agreements in the same way as, for example, the European Union.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Commonwealth operates on a principle of consensus decision-making; all members are considered equal, regardless of their economic size or power.  There is no weighted voting system.

Statement 3 is correct.  The head of the Commonwealth is chosen by its member states.  It's a position of symbolic leadership, not a position of executive power over the member states' internal affairs.

Statement 4 is correct. Queen Elizabeth II held the position of Head of the Commonwealth for a significant period, making her the longest-serving head in the organization's history.

Therefore, three of the statements are incorrect.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to India's cross-border energy cooperation:**

1.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is designed to transport electricity.
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Bhutan.
3.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline facilitates the transport of natural gas.
4.  The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar aims to enhance energy trade between India and Nepal.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports oil, not electricity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Arun III and Upper Karnali are hydropower projects in Nepal, a collaboration between India and Nepal, not Bhutan.

Statement 3 is correct. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline indeed transports natural gas between India and Nepal.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Katihar-Bornagar corridor aims to enhance electricity trade between India and Bangladesh, not Nepal.

Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following statements about the India-US defense relationship:**

1.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.
2.  The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) facilitates interoperability of military communications.
3.  The Malabar exercises involve India, the US, Australia, and Japan.
4.  INDUS-X is an initiative focused on promoting cooperation in space technology.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2018.

Statement 2 is correct. COMCASA is designed to improve interoperability of military communications.

Statement 3 is correct.  Malabar exercises are indeed a joint military exercise involving India, the US, Australia, and Japan.

Statement 4 is incorrect. INDUS-X focuses on defense industrial cooperation, not space technology.  It facilitates partnerships between US and Indian defense companies.

Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1.  Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its ninth member.
2.  The SCO's primary focus is on economic cooperation among its member states.
3.  The SCO has a permanent secretariat located in Beijing.
4.  India is a founding member of the SCO.


How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus became the tenth member, not the ninth.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While economic cooperation is a part of the SCO's agenda, its focus is broader, encompassing security, counter-terrorism, and regional stability.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SCO's permanent secretariat is located in Beijing, but  the question is phrased to mislead as the location is correct.

Statement 4 is incorrect. India joined the SCO later, not as a founding member.

Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**5. Consider the following statements about BIMSTEC:**

1.  BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2023.
2.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) includes all South Asian countries as members.
3.  BIMSTEC’s Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a key project under its purview.
4.  Nepal was the last country to ratify the BIMSTEC charter.


How many of the statements above are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC charter came into force in May 2024, not 2023.

Statement 2 is incorrect. BIMSTEC does not include all South Asian countries.  For example, Pakistan and Afghanistan are not members.

Statement 3 is correct. The Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a significant BIMSTEC initiative.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the passage mentions Nepal's ratification, it doesn't state definitively that it was the last to ratify.  The phrasing is designed to be a distractor.

Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**6. Consider the following about the Chabahar Port:**

1.  The Chabahar Port is located on the Arabian Sea.
2.  India, Iran, and Afghanistan signed a tripartite agreement in 2016 for its development.
3.  The port is intended to bypass Pakistan in providing access to Afghanistan.
4.  The INSTC (International North-South Transport Corridor) uses the Chabahar port as a key node.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, but the passage states the port is on the Gulf of Oman, a part of the Arabian Sea. This is a minor point intended to create uncertainty.

Statement 2 is correct. The tripartite agreement was indeed signed in 2016.

Statement 3 is correct. The port's strategic location aims to provide an alternative route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.

Statement 4 is correct. The INSTC utilizes the Chabahar port as a key component of its transportation network.

Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's participation in multilateral organizations:**

1.  India was the highest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping operations in 2023.
2.  India is a permanent member of the G7.
3.  India was invited as an outreach country to the 50th G7 summit.
4.  India is a member of the Supply Chain Council under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India provided the most military personnel to UN peacekeeping missions in 2023.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India is not a permanent member of the G7; it is an invited guest.

Statement 3 is correct. India participated in the 50th G7 summit as an outreach country.

Statement 4 is correct. India is a member of the Supply Chain Council, established under IPEF.

Therefore, three statements are correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1.  AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces only in areas declared as "disturbed areas".
2.  The Governor of a state has the sole authority to declare an area as a "disturbed area" under AFSPA.
3.  Legal proceedings against armed forces personnel operating under AFSPA require prior sanction from the Central Government.
4.  AFSPA is currently in effect in all states of Northeast India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AFSPA's special powers are applicable only in areas officially designated as "disturbed areas".

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Governor can declare an area as "disturbed," the central government also has the authority to do so.

Statement 3 is correct.  Legal actions against personnel under AFSPA require prior central government approval.

Statement 4 is incorrect. AFSPA's applicability is limited to specific parts of certain northeastern states, not all of them.

Therefore, only two statements are correct.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims to be challenging, requiring detailed knowledge and careful analysis.


**1. Consider the following water bodies:**

1. Celebes Sea
2. South China Sea
3. Gulf of Oman
4. Andaman Sea
5. Gulf of Aden
6.  Caribbean Sea

How many of the above are associated with the geographical locations mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Celebes Sea is mentioned in relation to the Philippines. The South China Sea is also linked to the Philippines. The Gulf of Oman is associated with Iran and the UAE. The Andaman Sea is connected to Thailand. The Gulf of Aden is mentioned in relation to Somalia. The Caribbean Sea is associated with Mexico and other Central American countries.  Therefore, five out of the six water bodies are directly linked to locations discussed in the text. Option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they underrepresent the number of water bodies correctly linked to the provided geographical information.


**2. Consider the following island groups/islands:**

1. Chagos Islands
2. Saint Martin's Island
3. Senkaku Islands
4. Mariana Islands
5. Reunion Island
6. Abu Musa Island

How many of the above are subject to territorial disputes or sovereignty claims as mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chagos Islands are subject to a sovereignty dispute between the UK and Mauritius. Saint Martin's Island's sovereignty was once disputed but is now settled between Bangladesh and Myanmar. The Senkaku Islands are a point of contention between China, Japan, and Taiwan. Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the UAE. The Mariana Islands and Reunion Island are not mentioned in the text as being involved in territorial disputes. Thus, three of the listed islands are involved in sovereignty or territorial disputes. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they understate or overstate the number of islands involved in such disputes.


**3. Consider the following countries:**

1.  Tanzania
2.  Rwanda
3.  Uzbekistan
4.  Thailand
5.  Laos
6.  Philippines


How many of the above are landlocked countries as described in the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Rwanda is described as a landlocked country in Central Africa. Uzbekistan is explicitly identified as a double landlocked country in Central Asia. Laos is also described as landlocked in Southeast Asia. Tanzania, Thailand, and the Philippines have coastlines and are therefore not landlocked.  Therefore, only two of the listed countries are landlocked according to the provided text. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to miscounting of landlocked nations in the text.


**4. Consider the following geographical features:**

1.  Lake Turkana
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro
3.  Lipulekh Pass
4.  Suez Canal
5.  Seine River

The Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy is a Japanese initiative. The Digital Infrastructure Growth Initiative for India Framework (DiGi Framework) involves India, Japan, and the U.S., and is explicitly mentioned in the text as a collaboration involving India and Japan. Therefore, three of the initiatives involve collaboration between India and Japan. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the level of collaboration between India and Japan regarding the initiatives listed.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The McMahon Line is relevant to the India-China border dispute. The Treaty of Sagauli is mentioned in the context of the India-Nepal border dispute. The Arab League Summit is discussed as a recent event. The Simla Convention of 1914 is mentioned in relation to the McMahon Line. The Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) is mentioned in the context of India-Japan defense cooperation. Therefore, all five items are mentioned in the text as relevant to geopolitical relations or agreements. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of geopolitical elements mentioned in the text.

Only statement 1 accurately reflects an anticipated feature of the IMEC.  The corridor is envisioned to improve global connectivity. Statement 2 is incorrect; the IMEC's focus is broader than just India-China energy cooperation.  Statement 3 is partially true, as it offers an alternative route, but it's not the primary goal. Statement 4 is incorrect as there's no direct mention of SCO involvement in the IMEC's description.  Therefore, only one statement accurately reflects the IMEC, making (a) the correct option. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include statements that misrepresent the IMEC's aims and scope.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The charter came into force in 2024, it defines BIMSTEC's aims and structure, and Nepal's ratification was a key step in its activation.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the BIMSTEC Charter's focus is on multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation, not primarily military matters.  Therefore, three statements are accurate, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the content and purpose of the BIMSTEC Charter.

**Explanation:** The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) established a Supply Chain Agreement with multiple participating nations. Under this agreement, three key bodies were formed: the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board.  These three bodies work in coordination to address supply chain vulnerabilities, respond to disruptions, and improve labor conditions within the regional supply chains. Option (d) is incorrect because the IPEF itself is the overarching framework, not a component of the agreement. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect as they underrepresent the number of established bodies.

How many of the above are initiatives either directly led by or significantly involving the G7 group of nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The PGII, "Energy for Growth in Africa," and FSOI are all initiatives either directly launched by or significantly involving the G7 nations. The PGII aims to mobilize investment in infrastructure projects globally, while "Energy for Growth in Africa" focuses specifically on clean energy in Africa. The FSOI addresses ocean sustainability.  AITIGA, on the other hand, is a trade agreement between ASEAN and India, not directly linked to the G7.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) with Japan
2.  BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement
3.  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) with the UAE
4.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework

How many of the above are significant Currency Swap Agreements (CSAs) involving India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** India has engaged in several significant CSAs to bolster its financial stability and regional cooperation.

All four options represent actual CSAs where India played a crucial role.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)
2.  The handing over of INS Kirpan to Vietnam
3.  Exercises PASSEX, VINBAX, and MILAN
4.  Elevation of bilateral relations to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership"

How many of the above represent initiatives undertaken to strengthen India-Vietnam relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** India and Vietnam have significantly strengthened their bilateral ties through various mechanisms. The MGC involves India and several ASEAN countries, including Vietnam, promoting regional cooperation. The transfer of INS Kirpan signifies defense cooperation.  The joint military exercises (PASSEX, VINBAX, and MILAN) enhance interoperability.  The elevation of the relationship to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" indicates a high level of commitment. All four options are accurate representations of initiatives aimed at strengthening India-Vietnam relations.


**6. Consider the following international organizations:**

1.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
2.  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)
4.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)

How many of the above organizations have India as a member or active participant?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** India actively participates in the IAEA,  ITU, and CMF. The IAEA is crucial for nuclear cooperation and safety, the ITU for telecommunications, and the CMF for maritime security.  NATO, however, does not include India among its members.  Therefore, only three of the listed organizations have India's active involvement.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC)
2.  The South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)
3.  The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network
4.  The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative

How many of the above are mechanisms or initiatives focused on combating transnational organized crime or related issues?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Explanation:**  The UNTOC is a foundational international treaty addressing transnational organized crime. SAWEN targets wildlife crime within South Asia. The GLOBE Network focuses on anti-corruption efforts, a key element in combating organized crime.  The GenJust initiative aims to engage youth in crime prevention, a proactive approach to reducing future crime.  All four listed items directly or indirectly address transnational organized crime or related issues.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
2.  The Group of Seven (G7)
3.  The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
4.  The Commonwealth

How many of the above are intergovernmental organizations where India holds a significant role?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  India is a member of the SCO, a significant player in the G7's outreach initiatives, a founding member and influential voice within NAM, and the largest member of the Commonwealth.  All four organizations feature India in prominent roles.


**9. Consider the following regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  It will be a cornerstone of global connectivity.
2.  It enhances connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
3.  It aligns with the objectives of the PM Gati Shakti Program.
4.  It is primarily focused on promoting agricultural exports from India.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the features of the IMEC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The IMEC is designed to significantly improve connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, acting as a key element in global connectivity.  It aims to boost economic activity and is aligned with India's PM Gati Shakti Program for infrastructure development.  However, while the IMEC will undoubtedly facilitate trade, it is not *primarily* focused on agricultural exports; its scope is broader than that.


**10. Consider the following statements about the International Criminal Court (ICC):**

1.  It issued an arrest warrant against Russia's President regarding the situation in Ukraine.
2.  It sought arrest warrants for Israel's Prime Minister and Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes.
3.  Member states are obligated to comply with ICC arrest warrants.
4.  The ICC is a specialized agency of the United Nations.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the ICC's actions and responsibilities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The ICC has indeed issued arrest warrants concerning the situations in Ukraine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, as stated in options 1 and 2.  Member states are generally obligated to cooperate with ICC arrest warrants. However, the ICC is *not* a specialized agency of the United Nations; it is an independent international organization.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economic aspects and adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions aim to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with regional economic blocs:**

1.  India's trade with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) results in a trade surplus for India.
2.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to bypass Pakistan for trade with Afghanistan.
3.  The Chabahar Port project is primarily intended to enhance India's connectivity with Central Asia and Europe.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with GCC countries.  Statement 2 is partially correct; while IMEC aims to improve connectivity, the text also highlights Chabahar Port's role in bypassing Pakistan for trade with Afghanistan.  Statement 3 is correct.  The Chabahar Port's geostrategic location and its role in connecting India with Central Asia and Europe are clearly explained. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The BIMSTEC charter came into force in May 2024, not 2022. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.

1.  The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership focuses on combating malaria.
2.  The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to develop sustainable port infrastructure.
3.  The AUKUS agreement is a formal military alliance similar to NATO.
4.  MAITRI initiative leverages tools from the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness.

Which of the above statements are accurate?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" targets cervical cancer, not malaria. Statement 2 is correct. The partnership's aim is explicitly stated in the text. Statement 3 is incorrect. AUKUS is explicitly described as *not* a formal military alliance like NATO. Statement 4 is correct. The MAITRI initiative's connection to the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness is mentioned. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding economic partnerships involving India:**

1.  The Malaysia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA) aims to restrict UPI payments.
2.  India's trade with Malaysia makes it India's largest trading partner within ASEAN.
3.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore results in a trade surplus for India.
4.  The ASEAN Future Forum was established in 2022.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. MICECA aims to *deepen* economic partnership, including accepting UPI payments, not restrict them. Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Malaysia is a significant trading partner for India within ASEAN, the text states that Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN. Statement 3 is incorrect. The text states that India is a net *importer* under the India-Singapore CECA, indicating a trade deficit. Statement 4 is incorrect; The ASEAN Future Forum was proposed in 2023, not 2022. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with other nations:**

1.  The US designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2018.
2.  India's participation in the G7 summit was as a member state.
3.  The INDUS-X initiative is aimed at promoting cooperation in defence technology.
4.  The CAATSA Act aims to reward countries engaging with Russia, North Korea, and Iran.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The US designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016, not 2018. Statement 2 is incorrect; India participated as an *Outreach Country*, not a member state. Statement 3 is correct. INDUS-X facilitates partnerships in the defence sector. Statement 4 is incorrect. CAATSA aims to *punish*, not reward, countries engaging with those nations through sanctions.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**5. Consider the following multilateral organizations and initiatives:**

1.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has nine member states.
2.  The International Solar Alliance (ISA) has 100 member countries.
3.  The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) utilizes a blockchain-based system.
4.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1996.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Belarus recently joined, making the SCO have ten member states. Statement 2 is correct; the text explicitly states this number. Statement 3 is correct. The BCBPI is described as blockchain-based. Statement 4 is incorrect.  ARF was established in 1994, not 1996. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to challenge UPSC aspirants.  Remember, these questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subjects.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Kargil War:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar involved the Indian Navy blockading Pakistan's navy.
2. The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam.
3.  The key locations of the conflict included Tololing, Tiger Hill, and the Siachen Glacier.
4. Operation Talwar was an air force operation targeting Pakistani troops.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Kargil Review Committee, established in July 1999, was indeed chaired by K. Subrahmanyam.  Statement 3 is partially correct; Tololing and Tiger Hill were key locations, but the Siachen Glacier was not directly involved in the Kargil conflict, although it is a strategically important region in the overall context of India-Pakistan relations. Statement 1 is incorrect; Operation Safed Sagar was an Indian Air Force operation. Operation Talwar was a naval operation, but it aimed at a wider maritime strategy and not specifically targeting Pakistani troops on high-altitude positions in Kargil, as stated. Therefore, only two statements (2 and a modified 3) are entirely or partially correct.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern partially correct statements from entirely incorrect ones.


**2. Consider the following regarding the weaponization and militarization of space:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits all forms of military activity in space.
2.  Russia's veto of the UNSC resolution was primarily based on concerns about the treaty's focus on WMDs only.
3. Weaponization of space involves deploying weapons in space to target objects in orbit or on Earth.
4. Militarization of space is solely focused on deploying weapons systems in space.


Which of the above statements accurately reflects the complexities of space-related military activities?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on celestial bodies, or in outer space, but it doesn't explicitly prohibit all military activity.  Statement 2 is correct. Russia's veto highlighted the treaty's limitations in addressing non-WMD space weapons. Statement 3 accurately defines weaponization of space. Statement 4 is incorrect; militarization encompasses broader uses of space to support military operations, not just weapon deployment.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct. This question assesses conceptual understanding and the ability to analyze nuanced geopolitical issues.


**3. Consider the following regarding the IAEA and its programs:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks nuclear material theft incidents.
2. Atoms4Food primarily focuses on using nuclear technology for environmental remediation.
3. Atoms4NetZero promotes the use of nuclear energy for climate change mitigation.
4. The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles aims to improve nuclear reactor safety.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the IAEA's activities and programs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; while the ITDB tracks nuclear material theft, it also covers other illicit trafficking incidents. Statement 2 is incorrect; Atoms4Food focuses on improving food security and agriculture through nuclear techniques. Statement 3 is correct; Atoms4NetZero addresses climate change by promoting nuclear energy. Statement 4 is partially correct; while reactor safety is a concern, the project's broader goal is innovation in reactor technology and fuel cycles.  Therefore, only three statements (modified 1, 3, and modified 4) are largely accurate. The question tests factual recall and the ability to interpret the nuances of program descriptions.


**4. Consider the following about the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF):**

1.  The CMF operates solely in the Indian Ocean.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by any nation within the CMF.
3. India's participation in CMF is relatively recent.
4. The CMF is a solely naval initiative with no involvement from other branches of the military.


How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the CMF and India's role?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CMF operates across multiple maritime zones. Statement 2 is incorrect; while Operation Crimson Barracuda was significant for India, it wasn't the *first* drug seizure operation within the CMF. Statement 3 is correct; India joined the CMF relatively recently (2022). Statement 4 is incorrect; the CMF involves coordination among various national militaries and their different branches.  Therefore, only two statements (3, and a modified 2 to remove the "first" claim) are largely accurate.  The question challenges factual recall and understanding of international maritime collaborations.


**5. Consider these statements regarding India's relations with the Maldives:**

1. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives primarily focused on economic concerns.
2. Operation Neer primarily involved supplying vaccines during a health crisis.
3. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure undertaking supported by India.
4. The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) aims to primarily boost bilateral trade.


How many of the above statements accurately depict aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the "India Out" campaign was primarily focused on concerns about Indian military presence. Statement 2 is incorrect; Operation Neer provided water during a water crisis, not vaccines. Statement 3 is correct; the Greater Male Connectivity Project is a major infrastructure initiative. Statement 4 is partially correct; while it does impact trade indirectly, the CSA's primary goal is to help the Maldives manage its foreign exchange reserves.  Thus, only two statements (3, and a modified 4) are accurate. This question tests the ability to recall and analyze details of bilateral relationships.  The careful wording of the options creates plausible distractors.


**6. Consider the following regarding BIMSTEC:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2022.
2.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a key initiative.
3.  The principle of non-interference in internal affairs is a core tenet of BIMSTEC.
4. BIMSTEC primarily focuses on military cooperation among its members.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the BIMSTEC organization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the charter came into force *after* being signed in 2022.  Statement 2 is correct; the transport connectivity plan is a key project. Statement 3 is correct; non-interference is a core principle. Statement 4 is incorrect; BIMSTEC focuses on multi-sectoral cooperation, not solely military aspects.  Therefore, three statements (modified 1, 2, and 3) are correct. The question assesses the understanding of regional organizations and their operational principles.


**7. Consider the following concerning the East Asia Summit (EAS):**

1. The EAS is solely focused on economic cooperation among its members.
2.  The EAS includes all members of ASEAN.
3.  The EAS was established in 2005.
4. The EAS prioritizes military alliances among its participants.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the EAS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the EAS addresses broader strategic and political issues beyond just economics. Statement 2 is correct; the EAS includes all ASEAN members plus other partners. Statement 3 is correct; the EAS was established in 2005. Statement 4 is incorrect; the EAS emphasizes dialogue and cooperation, not military alliances.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are correct.  This question tests knowledge of significant international forums and their mandates.



**8. Consider the following regarding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):**

1. The AIIB primarily focuses on providing loans to high-income countries.
2. The AIIB is a regional development bank focused exclusively on Asia.
3. The AIIB's role includes assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources.
4. The AIIB is solely funded by the Asian member states.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the AIIB's characteristics and functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the AIIB primarily focuses on infrastructure development in developing countries, including low-income ones. Statement 2 is partially correct; while the bank focuses on Asia, it's not exclusively limited to Asian members. Statement 3 is correct; assisting low-income countries is a key function. Statement 4 is incorrect; the AIIB has a diverse membership beyond just Asian states. Therefore, only one statement (3) is entirely correct. This question assesses understanding of international financial institutions and their operational focus.  The distractors highlight potential misconceptions about the AIIB's scope and funding.


**9. Consider the following statements regarding the Arab League:**

1. The Arab League is primarily concerned with economic issues among its member states.
2. All Arab nations are members of the Arab League.
3. The Arab League Summits are held annually.
4. The Arab League plays a significant role in regional political affairs.


Which of the above statements are accurate representations of the Arab League?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Arab League addresses a wide range of political and social issues in addition to economic matters. Statement 2 is incorrect; not all Arab nations are members. Statement 3 is incorrect; the summits are not held annually. Statement 4 is correct; the Arab League is a major player in regional politics.  Only statement 4 accurately reflects the Arab League's role. This question demands a good understanding of international political organizations and their functions.


**10. Consider the following regarding conflict-affected areas:**

1. Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized as part of Armenia.
2. Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island) is located in the Black Sea.
3. The Nord Stream pipelines primarily transport oil from Russia to Germany.
4. The Kursk Region borders Ukraine.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the geographical and political aspects of these regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Nagorno-Karabakh is officially part of Azerbaijan. Statement 2 is correct; Snake Island is in the Black Sea. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Nord Stream pipelines transport natural gas, not oil. Statement 4 is correct; the Kursk Region shares a border with Ukraine. Therefore, three statements (2, 4 and a modified 3) are correct. This question requires knowledge of international geography and current events related to geopolitical conflicts.  The distractors offer plausible but incorrect details.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022
4. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004
5. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956

How many of the above are Indian measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as assessed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India assesses the country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  All five options listed are integral parts of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework. The PMLA and UAPA provide the legal basis for combating these crimes. The FIU-IND and ED are key enforcement agencies, responsible for investigating and prosecuting offenses. The MLAT Portal facilitates international cooperation in these areas. Therefore, all five options are directly relevant to India's efforts as evaluated by the FATF.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly omit crucial components of India's comprehensive strategy.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. The Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)
2. The Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand)
3. The Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran)
4. Canada
5. Uruguay
6. 27 US jurisdictions

How many of the above are regions or countries where cannabis is most abused, according to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, or where cannabis has been legalized?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Five
(d) Six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC's World Drug Day Report highlights the Triple Frontier Area, the Golden Triangle, and the Golden Crescent as regions with high rates of cannabis abuse.  Additionally, the report notes that cannabis has been legalized in Canada, Uruguay, and 27 US jurisdictions. Therefore, all six options are correctly identified as either regions of high cannabis abuse or areas where its legal status has changed. Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the number of regions or countries fitting the criteria presented in the question.


**3. Consider the following international conventions:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3. The 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)
4. The Geneva Protocol of 1925

How many of the above conventions are related to the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction or serious international crimes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.  The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  The Geneva Protocol of 1925, while historically significant, is less comprehensive than the other three.  It primarily prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war but doesn't address production or stockpiling to the same extent. Therefore, three of the four conventions directly relate to the regulation or prohibition of weapons of mass destruction or serious international crimes.


**4. Consider the following:**

1. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity
2. The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002
3. The SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network)
4. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention)
5. The Global Firearms Programme (GFP)

How many of the above are initiatives or mechanisms to tackle transnational organized crime or enhance regional cooperation in South Asia?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNTOC, SAWEN, and the SAARC Convention directly address transnational organized crime. The BIMSTEC Master Plan, while focused on transport connectivity, indirectly contributes to regional stability and cooperation, which is crucial for combating transnational crime.  The GFP, while a global initiative, plays a role in preventing the flow of illicit firearms, a major factor in organized crime. Therefore, four of the five initiatives are directly or indirectly related to combating transnational organized crime or enhancing regional cooperation in South Asia.


**5. Consider the following organizations:**

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
2. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU)
3. The Universal Postal Union (UPU)
4. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
5. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)

How many of the above are specialized agencies of the United Nations or intergovernmental organizations focused on specific sectors?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA, ITU, and UPU are specialized agencies of the United Nations.  The AIIB, while an intergovernmental organization, is not a UN agency. OPEC is also an intergovernmental organization focused on a specific sector (oil). Therefore, four of the organizations listed are specialized agencies or intergovernmental organizations with specific mandates.  Option (b) incorrectly underestimates the number of organizations fitting the description.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on international organizations, treaties, and conventions.  Each question is designed to be challenging and requires detailed knowledge of the subject matter.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding international treaties aimed at controlling weapons of mass destruction:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, with a mechanism for verification of compliance.
3. The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, including those involving weapons of mass destruction.
4. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in international armed conflict, but not their development or stockpiling.


How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the respective treaties?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is a comprehensive treaty that bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, and includes robust verification mechanisms. The Rome Statute created the ICC with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, which can involve the use of weapons of mass destruction. The Geneva Protocol prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the *development, production, and stockpiling*, not just the use, of biological weapons.


**2. Consider the following organizations and their primary functions:**

1. The Universal Postal Union (UPU): A specialized agency of the United Nations focused on international postal services.
2. The Five Eyes Alliance: A multilateral intelligence alliance focused on sharing signals intelligence.
3. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS): A UN initiative focused on addressing the digital divide and promoting the use of information and communication technologies for development.
4. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+): A cartel of oil-producing countries that coordinates oil production to influence global oil prices.
5. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB): A multilateral development bank focused on financing infrastructure projects in Asia.


Which of the above organizations are primarily involved in international cooperation and development, rather than security or intelligence gathering?

(a) 1, 3, and 5
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) aims to eliminate chemical weapons and prevent their future use.
2. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) monitors and reports on illicit nuclear trafficking through its Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB).
4. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, with no direct involvement in weapons proliferation.


How many of the above statements correctly describe international initiatives related to weapons of mass destruction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the roles of the CWC, BWC, and IAEA in addressing weapons of mass destruction. The CWC comprehensively bans chemical weapons, the BWC prohibits biological weapons, and the IAEA's ITDB is crucial for monitoring nuclear material trafficking, a key aspect of preventing nuclear proliferation.

How many of the above correctly describe recent activities or roles of the named organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect recent activities of the ITU, INCB, and CCPCJ. The ITU's release of the GCI, INCB's reelection, and CCPCJ's GenJust initiative are all documented.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the AIIB's mandate explicitly includes assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources for development projects, contrary to the statement.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding international treaties and conventions:**

1. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in conflict.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) entered into force in 1997.
3. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, was adopted in 2000.

How many of the above statements accurately describe international legal frameworks?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Geneva Protocol bans the use of chemical and biological weapons, the CWC entered into force in 1997, and the Palermo Convention addresses transnational organized crime.  Statement 4 is partially incorrect; while the Rome Statute of 1998 established the ICC, its jurisdiction extends beyond war crimes to include crimes against humanity and genocide.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements related to India's participation in international initiatives:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India participated in the 50th G7 Summit as an Outreach Country.

Statement 4 is incorrect; while India's MER was reviewed, it was first adopted in 2010, not 2024.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.



**5. Consider the following regarding regional organizations and initiatives:**

1. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) welcomed Belarus as its tenth member.
2. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) acquired legal personality after its charter came into force.
3. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is intended to enhance connectivity within the Middle East solely.

**7. Consider the following concerning the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC):**

1.  The UNODC released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.
2.  The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
3.  The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is focused on reducing illicit arms trafficking.
4.  The UNODC's primary focus is on combating drug abuse and illicit trafficking, exclusively.

How many of the above accurately reflect the UNODC’s roles and activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of UNODC activities. The World Wildlife Crime Report, its role in UNTOC, and the GFP are all part of its mandate. Statement 4 is incorrect; while drug control is a significant part of its work, the UNODC also addresses broader transnational organized crime issues, including wildlife crime and illicit arms trafficking. Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
3.  The FATF is a United Nations agency primarily focused on preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
4. The FATF's assessment includes analyzing a country's legislative frameworks related to money laundering.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the FATF and its functions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of the FATF and its processes.  The MER assesses anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and the assessment includes analyzing legislative frameworks. Statement 3 is incorrect; the FATF is an inter-governmental body, not a UN agency, and while its work indirectly relates to weapons proliferation (through financial flows), its primary focus is on money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and test factual recall, analysis, and the ability to discern subtle differences between closely related concepts.


**1. Consider the following features of a prominent geographical feature:**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB does focus on illicit nuclear trafficking, it reports incidents from across the globe, not just member states.  The IAEA monitors nuclear security globally. Statement 2 is correct; Atoms4Food is a genuine IAEA initiative employing nuclear science and technology to improve food production and security. Statement 3 is incorrect. Atoms4NetZero actively promotes the use of nuclear energy as a low-carbon source to contribute to global net-zero emission goals.  The program seeks to leverage nuclear power's potential for decarbonization. Statement 4 is also correct; the IAEA does indeed have a program focused on innovation in nuclear reactor technology and fuel cycles to ensure safety and efficiency. Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 4) accurately describe the IAEA's activities.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments at the *national* level, evaluating a country's overall preparedness. Statement 2 is correct; India was indeed recognized as a "role-modeling" country in Tier 1, signifying a strong commitment across cybersecurity pillars. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The GCI 2024 indicates that most nations are still in the early stages of cybersecurity development, categorized as "establishing" or "evolving". Statement 4 is correct; the GCI assessment encompasses a comprehensive evaluation of a country's cybersecurity framework, including policies, strategies, and capabilities.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the GCI 2024 report and India's performance.


**3. Consider the following statements related to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC):**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect key aspects of the CWC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997.  The order of years is reversed. Statement 2 is correct; the CWC's core objective is the complete elimination of chemical weapons, with member states bound by deadlines for destroying stockpiles. Statement 3 is correct; the convention incorporates robust verification mechanisms, including on-site inspections, to ensure compliance. Statement 4 is incorrect.  While the CWC has a high number of signatories, a small number of countries have not joined the convention.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) correctly depict the CWC's features.


**4. Consider the following about India's initiatives to combat money laundering and terrorist financing:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) was enacted in 1967.

3.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a significant role in enforcing anti-money laundering laws.
4.  India launched a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) portal in 2022 to facilitate international cooperation.


How many of the statements above accurately describe India's measures against money laundering and terrorist financing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) was enacted in 2002, not 1967.  1967 is the year of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956. 1956 is the year the Directorate of Enforcement was founded. Statement 3 is correct; the ED is a key agency in India's fight against financial crimes, actively involved in enforcing anti-money laundering regulations. Statement 4 is correct; the MLAT portal launched in 2022 aims to streamline international cooperation in tackling cross-border financial crimes.  Thus, only three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies opioids as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report is published biennially.
3.  The UNODC's reports highlight the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") as a significant drug production region.
4.  The UNODC reports consistently show a global decline in cannabis use due to increased international efforts.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of UNODC reports?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4
(d) 1 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cannabis is the most widely abused drug, not opioids. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report is an annual publication, not biennial. Statement 3 is correct; the reports consistently highlight the Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle) as a major area for illicit drug production and trafficking. Statement 4 is incorrect.  The UNODC reports do not show a global decline in cannabis use; in fact, legalization efforts in some regions have led to increased accessibility and consumption.  Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects the UNODC's findings.


**6. Consider the following international organizations and their recent activities:**

1.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) released India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) in 2010.
2.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) recently admitted Belarus as its tenth member.
3.  The Group of Seven (G7) launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) in 2023.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect recent activities of these international organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, the statement implies a recent release which is not true.  The FATF regularly updates and reviews MERs. Statement 2 is correct; Belarus's admission to the SCO is a recent development. Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2023. Statement 4 is correct; OPEC+ did recently extend its oil production cuts.  Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) accurately represent recent activities.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international forums:**

1.  India contributed to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund in 2022 under its presidency of the UN Security Council's Counter-Terrorism Committee.

3.  India was invited as an outreach country to the 50th G7 summit held in Apulia, Italy.
4.  India was elected Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's recent participation in international events and organizations?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund occurred as described.  Statement 2 is correct; India did host the CHOGM in New Delhi in 1983, not 2010.  Statement 3 is correct; India's participation in the G7 summit as an outreach country is accurate.  Statement 4 is also correct; India's election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council is a recent development.  Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's international engagement.


**8. Consider the following regarding agreements and initiatives concerning conflict resolution in Northeast India:**

1.  The Bru-Reang agreement was signed in 2019, resolving a long-standing displacement issue.

3. The Karbi Anglong Agreement, signed in 2021, involved armed groups surrendering and accepting a developmental package.
4.  The Mizo National Front (MNF) peace accord was instrumental in establishing peace in Mizoram.


How many of these statements correctly describe peace initiatives in Northeast India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Bru-Reang agreement was signed in 2020, not 2019. Statement 2 is correct; the NLFT Peace Accord achieved the surrender and reintegration of the group. Statement 3 is correct; the Karbi Anglong Agreement successfully addressed the conflict in Assam. Statement 4 is partially correct; while peace has been established in Mizoram, the MNF peace accord is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text.  Therefore, only three statements (2 and 3) accurately describe the peace initiatives in Northeast India.  The MNF peace accord is not directly linked to the other initiatives.


**9. Consider the following organizations and their mandates:**

1. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) publishes an annual flagship publication, the "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific."

How many of the above statements correctly describe the organizations and their key activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; UNESCAP publishes the annual survey as stated. Statement 2 is incorrect; UNCTAD celebrated its 60th anniversary, not its 70th. Statement 3 is correct; the UN-GSCF's focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions using digital tools is accurate. Statement 4 is incorrect. While the G4 nations do advocate for permanent UNSC seats, the composition listed is not entirely accurate; the correct G4 nations are Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan.  Therefore, only three statements (1 and 3) accurately reflect the organizations and their activities.  The incorrect information in statements 2 and 4 makes them inaccurate.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on economics and international relations, designed to be challenging and incorporating plausible distractors:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India-China trade relations:**

1.  China is India's largest trading partner in goods as of 2023.
2.  India consistently experiences a significant trade surplus with China.
3.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) disputes significantly impact bilateral trade volumes.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) All three  (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  The provided text explicitly states that China is India's largest trading partner in goods as of 2023.

Statement 2 is incorrect: The text highlights a "significant trade deficit for India," indicating that India imports far more from China than it exports.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 3 is partially true but not explicitly stated in a quantifiable manner. While LAC tensions undoubtedly create an atmosphere of uncertainty that *could* impact trade, the text doesn't provide specific data linking the disputes to quantifiable trade volume changes. Therefore, it's safer to consider this statement as incorrect in the context of a definitive MCQ.



**2. Consider the following regarding the India-Bangladesh relationship:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The "Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant" is a joint India-Bangladesh energy project.

3.  The TAPI pipeline facilitates cross-border electricity trade between India and its neighboring countries.

How many of the above statements are correctly matched?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text explicitly mentions Arun III and Upper Karnali as India-Nepal hydropower projects.

Statement 2 is correct: The text describes the planned electricity corridor between Katihar and Bornagar as an India-Bangladesh initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The TAPI pipeline is for natural gas, not electricity. This is a crucial distractor playing on the general theme of energy cooperation.



**4. Consider the following statements concerning the BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation):**

1.  The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text confirms that the BIMSTEC Charter came into force in May 2024.

Statement 2 is correct:  The text states that Nepal's ratification finalized the charter's implementation.

Statement 3 is incorrect: While security is a focus area, BIMSTEC's mandate is far broader, encompassing trade, environment, agriculture, and people-to-people contact, as explicitly mentioned in the text.  This is a key distractor highlighting a common misconception.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) All three (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text explicitly links the summit to the philosophy of "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" ("One Earth, One Family, One Future").

Statement 2 is incorrect: The text specifically notes that China and Pakistan were *not* invited.

Statement 3 is correct: The text details India's proposal for a "Global Development Compact" aimed at addressing the rising debt of developing countries.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text mentions the launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives as a key outcome of a recent visit.

Statement 2 is correct: The text explicitly states that a Currency Swap Agreement was signed.

Statement 3 is incorrect: The "India Out" campaign, as described in the text, actually advocated for the *withdrawal* of Indian military personnel, the opposite of what the statement claims.  This functions as a strong distractor based on a reversal of the facts.


**7. Consider the following regarding India-Singapore relations:**

1.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner within ASEAN.
2.  India is a net exporter in its trade relationship with Singapore.
3.  "Project Nexus" aims to improve cross-border payments using UPI.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text confirms Singapore's position as India's largest ASEAN trading partner.

Statement 2 is incorrect: The text specifies that India is a net *importer* from Singapore.

Statement 3 is correct: The description of "Project Nexus" aligns with the text's explanation of its goal to connect UPI with other FPS systems for faster cross-border payments.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 only (b) 1 and 2 only (c) 1 and 3 only (d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The text clearly states that the Act grants disciplinary powers to the C-i-C of ISOs.

Statement 2 is incorrect: The text defines ISO as a body including personnel from any two or all three services.

Statement 3 is incorrect (although very close to the truth):  The text mentions the Act being *notified* in 2023, not 2024.  The subtle year difference acts as a strong distractor.


1. Consider the following statements regarding India's bilateral and multilateral military exercises:

1. Exercise Al Najah V is a joint military exercise between India and Oman.
2. SIMBEX 2024 is a maritime exercise between India and Singapore, originating as 'Exercise Lion King'.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Exercise Al Najah V is indeed a joint military exercise conducted between India and Oman.  Statement 2 is also correct; SIMBEX, initially known as 'Exercise Lion King', is a significant maritime bilateral exercise between India and Singapore.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. Exercise Malabar is a *multilateral* maritime exercise, not trilateral, involving Australia, Japan, the United States, and India.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; Exercise Tarang Shakti is India's first multinational air exercise, not a bilateral exercise with Malaysia.  Exercise Udara Shakti is the joint air exercise between India and Malaysia. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are correct.


2. Consider the following statements about India's military exercises with different countries:

1. Exercise Eastern Bridge is conducted between the Indian Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Thailand.
2. Exercise Zayed Talwar is a naval exercise between India and the United Arab Emirates.

**1. Consider the following:**

1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999
4. The Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) Act, 1985

Which of the above Acts are primarily concerned with combating money laundering in India?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is the primary legislation in India designed to combat money laundering.  It establishes a framework for the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of money laundering offenses.  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, while not solely focused on money laundering, addresses terrorist financing, a significant aspect of money laundering activities. Therefore, both 1 and 2 are directly related to combating money laundering.  FEMA and NDPS Act, although relevant to financial crimes, are not primarily concerned with money laundering in the same direct way as PMLA and UAPA. FEMA deals with foreign exchange regulations, while the NDPS Act focuses on narcotics trafficking.  While these acts can indirectly relate to money laundering cases, their primary focus is different.  Therefore, option (a) is the most accurate.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Directorate of Enforcement (ED)
3. Reserve Bank of India (RBI)
4. Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT)

Which of the above institutions play a crucial role in India's anti-money laundering efforts?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) is the central national agency responsible for receiving, processing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and other financial crimes.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) is a key investigative agency that enforces economic laws and regulations, including those related to money laundering.  Both 1 and 2 are directly involved in anti-money laundering operations. The RBI and CBDT, while involved in financial matters, do not have the same direct role in combating money laundering as FIU-IND and ED. The RBI focuses on monetary policy and banking regulation, and the CBDT handles direct tax collection. While they may provide information or cooperate in investigations, they are not the primary agencies involved in anti-money laundering efforts. Therefore, only 1 and 2 are directly relevant, making (a) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. FATF conducts on-site inspections of member countries to assess their compliance.
2. FATF’s recommendations are legally binding on member countries.
3. FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) are peer-reviewed assessments.
4.  FATF primarily focuses on combating tax evasion.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct: FATF's MERs are indeed peer-reviewed assessments conducted by other FATF member countries to evaluate a country's effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  Statement 1 is incorrect: FATF does not conduct on-site inspections in the same way as some other international organizations. Its evaluation process relies on the submission of reports and data by member countries.  Statement 2 is incorrect: FATF's recommendations are not legally binding; they are guidelines that countries are expected to implement through their domestic laws and regulations.   Statement 4 is incorrect: While tax evasion can be related to money laundering, FATF's primary focus is not solely on tax evasion but broader issues of money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct, making (b) the correct option.


**4. Consider the following international conventions:**

1. Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
3. Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC)
4. The United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC)

Which of these conventions are directly related to the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) similarly prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  Both 1 and 2 are directly related to weapons of mass destruction.  The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide – these can involve weapons of mass destruction but aren't solely focused on their prohibition or regulation. UNCAC addresses corruption, which can be a factor in the proliferation of weapons, but isn't a direct regulation of weapons themselves. Therefore, only 1 and 2 directly address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction, making (a) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the UNODC's reports:**

1. The World Drug Day Report highlights the most abused drugs globally.
2. The World Wildlife Crime Report focuses on illegal wildlife trade and its impact on biodiversity.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: The World Drug Day Report indeed highlights global trends in drug abuse and the most commonly abused substances. Statement 2 is correct: The World Wildlife Crime Report focuses on the illegal trade in wildlife and its environmental and economic consequences. Statement 3 is incorrect: The UNODC's mandate is global, not limited to Africa; its reports cover transnational crime across various regions. Statement 4 is incorrect: UNODC reports are considered authoritative sources of data and analysis on transnational crime, including drug trafficking, wildlife crime, and corruption. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following regarding the IAEA's activities:**

4. The IAEA primarily focuses on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.

How many of the above statements regarding IAEA activities are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the ITDB's function in monitoring and reporting illicit trafficking of nuclear materials. Statement 2 correctly identifies Atoms4Food's aim in using nuclear techniques to enhance global food security. Statement 3 accurately describes Atoms4NetZero's role in promoting nuclear energy for reducing emissions.  While the IAEA does emphasize the peaceful uses of nuclear energy, it also addresses nuclear security and safeguards to prevent the misuse of nuclear materials.  Therefore, all three statements are correct representations of the IAEA's activities.

1. Supply Chain Council
2. Crisis Response Network
3. Labor Rights Advisory Board
4.  Investment Promotion Council

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, the Crisis Response Network provides a platform for collective responses to disruptions, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board works to enhance labor rights. These three bodies are explicitly mentioned as being established under the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement. An Investment Promotion Council is not mentioned in the context of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement. Therefore, only 1, 2, and 3 are part of the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement.


**8. Consider the following about the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in designated "disturbed areas."
2. AFSPA provides immunity to armed forces personnel from prosecution without prior sanction.
3. AFSPA is currently in effect across all of India.
4. AFSPA's application is determined by the Chief of Army Staff.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the AFSPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" due to insurgency or unrest.  Statement 2 is correct:  AFSPA grants a degree of immunity to armed forces personnel from prosecution, requiring prior sanction from the central government before legal proceedings can commence. Statement 3 is incorrect: AFSPA is not in effect across all of India but is applied to specific regions deemed "disturbed." Statement 4 is incorrect: The declaration of "disturbed areas" and the application of AFSPA are determined by the Governor of the state or the central government, not the Chief of Army Staff. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of AFSPA.


**9. Consider the following international organizations:**

1. OPEC+
2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
3. Universal Postal Union (UPU)
4. Five Eyes Alliance

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

OPEC+ focuses on oil production and pricing, not broader economic cooperation or infrastructure. The AIIB is dedicated to financing infrastructure projects in Asia. The UPU facilitates international postal services, impacting trade and communication. The Five Eyes Alliance is an intelligence-sharing partnership, not an economic or infrastructure organization. Therefore, only the AIIB (2) and UPU (3) fit the description of organizations primarily focused on economic cooperation or infrastructure development.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The G7 lacks a permanent secretariat; its functions are coordinated through the rotating presidency. Statement 2 is correct: The rotating presidency sets the agenda for each year's meetings. Statement 3 is incorrect: The G7 addresses a range of political, security, and economic issues.

Statement 1 is incorrect: The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Black Sea. Statement 2 is incorrect: The UAE's first nuclear power plant is within its own borders, not in Oman. Statement 3 is incorrect: Thailand does not share a land border with Vietnam; they are separated by the Gulf of Thailand and the South China Sea. Statement 4 is incorrect: Laos is a landlocked country, meaning it does not have a coastline. Only none of the statements are factually correct.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 (b) 1, 2, and 4 (c) 1 and 2 only (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Iran and the UAE both directly border the Persian Gulf.  While China engages extensively in trade and economic activities in the region, it does not have a direct maritime border with the Persian Gulf. Egypt is geographically distant from the Persian Gulf. Therefore, only Iran, the UAE and Egypt share maritime borders with the Persian Gulf. The inclusion of China as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of regional geopolitical dynamics.

(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. AITIGA was indeed signed in 2009 with the objective of reducing trade barriers and enhancing economic cooperation between India and the ASEAN member states.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting explicitly focused on reviewing the agreement's progress. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India consistently experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN, meaning it imports more goods from ASEAN than it exports to the bloc. This persistent trade imbalance is a significant aspect of the India-ASEAN economic relationship.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**2. Consider the following features of the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA):**

1. CSAs involve the exchange of currencies at predetermined rates with a future re-exchange date.
2.  India's BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is an example of a CSA.
3. CSAs primarily aim to stabilize exchange rates during periods of economic volatility.
4.  All decisions within the SAARC framework are made on the basis of consensus.

Which of the above statements accurately describe CSAs or their context within regional agreements?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  A CSA is fundamentally a contract for exchanging currencies at agreed-upon rates with a future reversal. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is indeed a type of CSA. Statement 3 is incorrect; while CSAs can offer some stability, their primary purpose is not necessarily exchange rate stabilization. They are more broadly used for managing liquidity and mitigating financial risks. Statement 4 is also incorrect; it describes the decision-making process within SAARC, not a characteristic of CSAs themselves. Thus, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the characteristics of CSAs or their context within the provided information.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF):**

1. India is the Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2. The IPEF includes agreements focusing on clean energy and fair trade practices.
3. The IPEF's Crisis Response Network facilitates collective responses to supply chain disruptions.
4.  The IPEF Upskilling Initiative primarily targets male workers in developed economies.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the IPEF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. India's role as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council, the existence of IPEF agreements focused on clean energy and fair trade (Clean Economy and Fair Economy pillars), and the role of the Crisis Response Network in addressing supply chain disruptions are all accurate descriptions of the IPEF. Statement 4 is incorrect; the IPEF Upskilling Initiative specifically targets women and girls in emerging economies, not men in developed economies.  Therefore, three of the four statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following initiatives related to combating transnational organized crime:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) is also known as the Palermo Convention.
2. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
3. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative focuses on engaging the elderly in crime prevention.
4. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) acts as the secretariat for UNTOC.

Which of the above statements correctly describe initiatives or conventions related to combating transnational organized crime?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. UNTOC is indeed known as the Palermo Convention, India is a member of SAWEN, and the UNODC serves as the secretariat for UNTOC.  Statement 3 is incorrect; GenJust focuses on engaging *youth*, not the elderly, in crime prevention. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect aspects of initiatives and conventions used to combat transnational organized crime.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding India-China relations:**

1. China is India's largest trading partner in goods.
2. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is completely demarcated.
3. The Galwan incident of 2020 was a significant escalation in border tensions.
4.  India considers the McDonald Line as the border in the Western sector.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of aspects of India-China relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct.  China is indeed India's largest trading partner in goods, and the Galwan incident marked a significant escalation of border tensions. Statement 2 is incorrect; the LAC is not fully demarcated and remains a source of contention. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India considers the Johnson Line, not the McDonald Line, as its claimed border in the Western sector. Therefore, only two statements accurately describe the India-China relationship.


**6. Consider the following about the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its tenth member.
2.  The SCO focuses primarily on economic cooperation among its members.
3. The SCO has adopted a cooperation program to counter terrorism and extremism.
4. India is a founding member of the SCO.


How many of the statements above accurately reflect aspects of the SCO?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Belarus's recent accession and the adoption of a cooperation program against terrorism and extremism are accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect; while economic cooperation is part of the SCO's agenda, its focus is broader, encompassing security and political cooperation as well. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India is not a founding member of the SCO.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect aspects of the SCO.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Group of Seven (G7):**

1. The G7 has a permanent secretariat to oversee its activities.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative.

4. The G7's presidency rotates annually, setting the agenda.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the G7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The PGII is a G7 initiative, and the rotating presidency sets the annual agenda. Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent secretariat. Statement 3 is also incorrect; India participates as an outreach country, not a full member. Therefore, only two of the statements accurately describe the G7.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1. BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2024.
2.  BIMSTEC's primary focus is on military cooperation among its members.
3. BIMSTEC includes a Master Plan for Transport Connectivity.
4. All BIMSTEC decisions are made through a weighted voting system.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of BIMSTEC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Quad's membership is accurately listed, and it has indeed launched initiatives related to combating cervical cancer (Quad Cancer Moonshot). Statement 2 is incorrect; while humanitarian assistance is a component, the Quad's focus is broader, encompassing security and strategic cooperation. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Quad doesn't have a permanent, independent secretariat.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe aspects of the Quad.


**10. Consider the following regarding the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC):**

1. SAARC's decision-making process relies on unanimity.
2.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) is a SAARC initiative.
3. SAARC has been highly effective in resolving bilateral disputes among its members.
4.  SAARC's primary focus is on environmental protection.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of SAARC?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. SAARC does operate on a unanimity-based decision-making process, and SAFTA is a significant SAARC initiative. Statement 3 is incorrect; SAARC has struggled to effectively resolve bilateral disputes, particularly those involving India and Pakistan. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while environmental issues are addressed, SAARC's scope is much broader than solely environmental protection.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect aspects of SAARC.



**1. Consider the following multinational military exercises involving the Indian Navy:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII
2. RIMPAC Exercise
3. Exercise Cutlass Express
4. Operation Southern Readiness

How many of the above exercises are primarily maritime in nature?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four exercises listed—IBSAMAR VIII (Indian, Brazilian, and South African Navies), RIMPAC (a large international maritime exercise), Exercise Cutlass Express (U.S. Naval Forces-led maritime exercise), and Operation Southern Readiness (a combined maritime forces exercise)—are primarily focused on maritime operations.  IBSAMAR is explicitly a joint naval exercise. RIMPAC is explicitly described as the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise.  Exercise Cutlass Express and Operation Southern Readiness both involve naval forces and maritime security operations. Therefore, all four are correctly categorized as primarily maritime exercises.  There are no incorrect options in this case.


**2. Consider the following multinational military exercises with Indian participation:**

1. Exercise Orion
2. Desert Flag
3. Operation Sadbhav
4. Tiger Triumph 2024

How many of these exercises primarily focus on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only Operation Sadbhav and Tiger Triumph 2024 are explicitly described as focusing on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.  Exercise Orion is a multinational exercise involving several countries, but its primary focus is not explicitly stated as HADR.  Similarly, Desert Flag is a multilateral air exercise, and while such exercises can have components related to humanitarian aid, it is not their primary purpose.  Therefore, only one of the listed exercises (Operation Sadbhav and Tiger Triumph 2024) fits the description of primarily focusing on HADR.


**3. Consider the following bilateral military exercises involving India:**

1. Exercise Al Najah V
2. Naseem-Al-Bahr
3. Exercise Eastern Bridge VII
4. Exercise Zayed Talwar

How many of these exercises involve the Indian Navy and a partner nation's navy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Naseem-Al-Bahr (India and Oman) and Exercise Zayed Talwar (India and UAE) are specifically mentioned as naval exercises between the Indian Navy and their respective partner nations' navies. Exercise Al Najah V is a joint military exercise, but it doesn't specify a focus on naval operations. Exercise Eastern Bridge VII is an air force exercise between India and Oman. Therefore, only two of the listed exercises involve the Indian Navy and a partner nation's navy.


**4. Consider the following bilateral military exercises involving India:**

1. SIMBEX 2024
2. Exercise Maitree
3. Exercise Udara Shakti
4. Exercise Samudra Laksamana

How many of these exercises are primarily maritime or naval in nature?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

SIMBEX 2024 (Singapore-India Maritime Bilateral Exercise), and Exercise Samudra Laksamana (India and Malaysia) are explicitly described as maritime or naval exercises. Exercise Maitree is a joint military exercise between India and Thailand, but it doesn't explicitly specify a focus on naval operations.  Exercise Udara Shakti is a joint air exercise between India and Malaysia.  Therefore, only three of the exercises are primarily maritime or naval in nature.


**5. Consider the following trilateral military exercises:**

1. Exercise Malabar
2. Exercise Freedom Edge
3. IMT TRILAT-2024

How many of these exercises involve the participation of the United States?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Malabar (Australia, Japan, the United States, and India) and Exercise Freedom Edge (South Korea, US, and Japan) both involve the United States. IMT TRILAT-2024 (India, Mozambique, Tanzania) does not include the United States. Therefore, only two of these exercises involve the participation of the United States.


**6. Consider the following multilateral military exercises involving India:**

1. Exercise Tarang Shakti
2. Khaan Quest
3. IBSAMAR VIII

How many of these exercises are primarily focused on air power or air force capabilities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Tarang Shakti is explicitly described as India's first multinational air exercise. Khaan Quest is a multinational military exercise but does not explicitly mention a focus on air power. IBSAMAR VIII is a maritime exercise.  Therefore, only one of these exercises is primarily focused on air power or air force capabilities.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's involvement in international military cooperation and peacekeeping?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate representations of India's role in international military collaborations and peacekeeping.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum directly aims to enhance education and capacity building among young diplomats from the Global South. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Social Impact Fund's objective is to accelerate DPI in the *Global South*, not developed nations. Statement 3 is accurate; "Aarogya Maitri" is indeed India's mission dedicated to global health security. Statement 4 is also correct. India successfully advocated for the African Union's permanent inclusion in the G20 during its presidency. Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent India's initiatives.


3. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):

1. Belarus's accession to the SCO makes it the eleventh member.
2. The SCO's 2025-2027 Cooperation Program focuses solely on counter-terrorism efforts.

4.  Kazakhstan hosted the 23rd SCO summit.


How many of the statements above are correct concerning the SCO?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus became the tenth member, not the eleventh. Statement 2 is also incorrect. While counter-terrorism is a key focus, the Cooperation Program also addresses separatism and extremism.  Statement 3 is correct; the SCO Development Strategy does indeed extend to 2035. Statement 4 is incorrect; the provided text mentions the 24th summit, not the 23rd, being held in Astana, Kazakhstan. Therefore, only one statement (3) is entirely accurate.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the G7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its presidency rotates annually, setting the agenda. Statement 2 is correct; the PGII's target is indeed $600 billion by 2027. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the G7 leads the initiative, it likely involves external investment sources as well. Statement 4 is correct; India participated as an Outreach Country in the 50th G7 summit. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are completely accurate.


5. Consider the following regarding the Commonwealth:

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the Commonwealth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India does represent roughly 60% of the Commonwealth's population. Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states India is the *fourth* largest contributor, not the largest. Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window was established under the India-UN *Development Fund*, not Partnership Fund. Statement 4 is incorrect. While 2024 marks 75 years, it commemorates the London Declaration, but the text doesn't directly link this to the modern Commonwealth's anniversary. Therefore, only one statement (1) is entirely accurate.


6. Consider the following regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) solely focuses on nuclear material theft.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the GCI does assess country-level cybersecurity commitments. Statement 2 is also correct; India is indeed among the "role-modelling" countries in the GCI 2024.  Statement 3 is partially correct, but it's an oversimplification. While digital service expansion is a factor, the GCI assesses broader cybersecurity commitments across multiple pillars. Statement 4 is incorrect; the GCI 2024 was released by the ITU, not the WHO. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are entirely accurate.


8. Consider the following regarding India's participation in Combined Maritime Forces (CMF):

1. India's participation in CMF dates back to 2021.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy under CMF.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; India joined CMF in 2022, not 2021. Statement 2 is correct; Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed the first such operation for the Indian Navy within CMF. Statement 3 is partially correct, but is an oversimplification.  While counter-terrorism is a major focus, CMF's activities extend beyond just that area. Statement 4 is incorrect. CMF is a multinational task force; its membership isn't limited to South Asian nations.  Therefore, only one statement (2) is fully correct.


9. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):

1. AFSPA has been permanently repealed in all parts of India.
2. AFSPA's extension to Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh is indefinite.
3. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in certain circumstances.

Which of the above statements concerning AFSPA are accurate?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AFSPA has not been completely repealed across India. Statement 2 is incorrect; the text mentions AFSPA's *extension* to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, not an indefinite extension.  Statement 3 is correct; AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces under specific conditions. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Bru-Reang Agreement didn't lead to AFSPA's complete repeal in Tripura.  Therefore, only one statement (3) is accurate.

How many of the statements above are correct regarding the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India's contribution to the fund was indeed $500,000 in 2022.  Statement 2 is partially correct, but it's an oversimplification. While national capabilities are a focus, CFT also enhances international and regional efforts. Statement 3 is incorrect; the fund was established in 2009, not 2017. Statement 4 is correct; the CTTP's aim is to help member states improve their capabilities in detecting and countering terrorists. Therefore, only three statements (1, 2, and 4) are largely correct.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. TEPA aims to improve trade relations, and three EFTA members are part of the EEA. Statement 1 is incorrect; EFTA is not a customs union like the EU. The year in which TEPA was signed is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, so statement 4 cannot be definitively assessed as correct or incorrect based on the available information.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

The Crisis Response Network does indeed facilitate collective emergency responses to disruptions. The Labor Rights Advisory Board *includes* workers, employers, and governments.  The IPEF agreement involves India and 13 other partners, not just the US.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are not correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate.  IMEC aims to be a cornerstone of *global* connectivity, extending far beyond South Asia (1 is incorrect). While regional connectivity is a component, the broader vision transcends regional limitations (2 is incorrect). IMEC's scope encompasses diverse sectors, not just energy (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only statement 3 correctly reflects the stated goals of IMEC.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its presidency rotates annually (1). The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2023 (2).  The summit was held in Apulia, Italy, not Rome (4).  Only statement 3 is correct, as India did participate as an Outreach Country. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect.

(d) 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. Cannabis is the most abused drug, not cocaine (1 is incorrect). The Golden Triangle (Death Triangle) includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, not Vietnam (2 is incorrect). Uruguay has indeed legalized cannabis. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for UNTOC.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correct.

The UPU did commemorate its 150th anniversary. OPEC+ extended oil output cuts into 2025, not 2024 (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding India's bilateral relations and regional initiatives:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports natural gas.
3. The BBIN initiative includes Sri Lanka.

The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, not Bhutan (4 is incorrect). Therefore, only one statement is accurate.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 2004 to combat financial crimes.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial information.
4. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is a crucial law in India's fight against money laundering.  It provides the legal framework for investigating and prosecuting money laundering offenses.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was actually established much earlier, in 1956, not 2004. While its role has expanded to include combating money laundering, its original mandate was broader.

Statement 3 is correct. The FIU-IND is a vital institution in India's anti-money laundering architecture. It receives, processes, and disseminates financial intelligence to law enforcement agencies, playing a key role in investigations.

Statement 4 is correct. The MLAT Portal enhances international cooperation by streamlining the process of requesting and providing information related to cross-border financial crimes.  This improves the effectiveness of investigations involving multiple jurisdictions.

Therefore, only three statements (1, 3, and 4) are correct.  The incorrect information about the ED's establishment year acts as a crucial distractor.


**2. Consider the following international organizations and their activities:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts mutual evaluations of countries' anti-money laundering measures.
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) publishes the World Drug Report annually, focusing primarily on cannabis production.
3. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is solely responsible for monitoring the global trade in opium.
4. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) focuses exclusively on combating cybercrime.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect the organizations' primary functions?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The FATF's core function is to assess countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through its mutual evaluation reports (MERs).

Statement 2 is partially correct but misleading. The UNODC *does* publish the World Drug Report annually, but it covers a broader range of drugs than just cannabis, including opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The focus on cannabis production as the *primary* focus is a misleading distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INCB is involved in monitoring controlled substances, its mandate is much broader than just opium. It monitors the global trade in various drugs and precursors under international drug control treaties.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The CCPCJ's mandate encompasses a wide range of transnational organized crimes, not just cybercrime.  It addresses issues like drug trafficking, human trafficking, and corruption.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 (with the caveat about the misleading detail regarding the UNODC report's focus) are largely accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's international collaborations:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India participates in the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network.
3. India is a signatory to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention).
4. India's participation in the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is limited to intelligence sharing.


Which of the above statements accurately describe India's involvement?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India is an active member of SAWEN, collaborating with other South Asian nations to combat wildlife crime.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the steering committee of GlobE demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.

Statement 3 is correct. India has ratified the Palermo Convention, signifying its commitment to combating transnational organized crime.

Statement 4 is incorrect. India's participation in CMF extends beyond intelligence sharing; it actively participates in operations, such as Operation Crimson Barracuda, demonstrating a more active role in maritime security.


Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of India's international collaborations.  The inclusion of the partially correct statement 4 creates a strong distractor.


**4. Consider the following about international conventions and agreements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
3. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
4. The Chemical Weapons Convention allows for the limited use of chemical weapons in self-defense.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the conventions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the respective conventions.  The Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention both prohibit the development, production, and use of their respective weapon types. The Rome Statute did indeed establish the ICC with the specified jurisdiction.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Chemical Weapons Convention does *not* permit the use of chemical weapons under any circumstances, including self-defense.  This makes 4 a strong distractor.  Therefore, three statements correctly describe the conventions.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international forums:**

1. India was the highest contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.
2.  India participated in the 50th Group of Seven (G7) Summit as a full member.
3. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing nearly 60% of its population.
4.  India's participation in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) focuses primarily on promoting the use of Hindi language online.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect India's involvement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India consistently provides a significant number of troops for UN peacekeeping missions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India was invited as an *outreach* country to the G7 summit, not as a full member.  The distinction is crucial.

Statement 3 is correct. India's large population makes it the most populous member of the Commonwealth.

Statement 4 is incorrect. India's participation in WSIS focuses on broader aspects of the information society, not solely on promoting the Hindi language online.  This is designed as a misleading distractor.


Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) accurately reflect India's involvement in the specified international forums.  The inclusion of partially true statements 2 and 4 makes this a challenging question.


Here are some difficult UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text about India's economic relations, designed to test factual recall, analysis, and evaluation skills.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's bilateral economic relationships:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
3.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline facilitates natural gas transportation.
4.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Nepal energy project.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India is the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia. Statement 3 is correct. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a key element of bilateral energy cooperation. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh project, not India-Nepal. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) are correct.  The incorrect statements include plausible distractors, closely related to the correct information, making simple elimination difficult.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  An upcoming electricity corridor connects Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam).
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Bhutan.
3.  The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydropower projects are located in Nepal.
4.  The TAPI pipeline transports natural gas across multiple South Asian countries.

Which of the above initiatives are directly related to India's cross-border electricity trade efforts?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the electricity corridor between Katihar and Bornagar is a key initiative to enhance India's electricity connectivity within the region. Statement 2 is incorrect; Arun III and Upper Karnali are India-Nepal projects, not India-Bhutan. Statement 3 is incorrect; these projects are located in Bhutan. Statement 4, while mentioning a pipeline, is not directly related to electricity trade.  The TAPI pipeline is for natural gas. Therefore, only statements 1 (electricity corridor) are directly related to India's cross-border electricity trade efforts. Option (b) is the correct answer, highlighting the need for precise understanding of the initiatives.  The distractors (incorrect statements) are plausible because they involve similar geographical locations and energy projects, making the question challenging.


**3. Consider the following regarding India-Maldives relations:**

1.  India launched RuPay cards in the Maldives to improve financial inclusion.
2.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives promoted closer ties with China.
3.  Operation Neer was an Indian initiative to provide medical assistance during a Maldivian crisis.
4.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a major infrastructure project funded solely by the Maldivian government.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  India's introduction of RuPay cards reflects efforts to strengthen economic ties. Statement 2 is also correct. The "India Out" campaign highlights the complexities and challenges in the relationship. Statement 3 is correct; Operation Neer was a humanitarian response during a water crisis. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure project developed with significant Indian assistance.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect positive aspects of the bilateral relationship.  The inclusion of the "India Out" campaign (statement 2) serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to understand the nuances of the relationship.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with regional organizations:**

1.  India is a member of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).
2.  India participates in the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue.
3.  The Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) includes India, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Mauritius, and Bangladesh.
4.  India chairs the Colombo Process, focusing on maritime cooperation in the Indian Ocean region.

How many of the above statements accurately describe India's participation in regional organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India is a key member of BIMSTEC. Statement 2 is correct. The India-GCC meetings highlight India's engagement with the Gulf region. Statement 3 is largely correct but contains a subtle inaccuracy:  The membership of the Colombo Security Conclave is still evolving and may not yet definitively include all the countries listed.  Therefore, while the core idea is accurate, the precise membership needs verification, making it a difficult distractor. Statement 4 is correct. India's chairmanship of the Colombo Process demonstrates its commitment to regional maritime cooperation.  Therefore, three statements (1, 2, and 4) accurately reflect India's participation. The subtle inaccuracy in statement 3 makes this a challenging question, rewarding those with a deep understanding of the topic.


**5. Consider the following about India's energy partnerships:**

1.  India and Bhutan have collaborated on several hydropower projects, including Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu.
2.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline facilitates the transportation of natural gas between India and Nepal.
3.  The TAPI pipeline is a major initiative involving Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.
4.  India’s energy cooperation with Bangladesh includes the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's energy partnerships?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect different facets of India's energy partnerships. The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects represent successful collaborations with Bhutan. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline enhances energy connectivity with Nepal. The TAPI pipeline is a significant regional initiative. And the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant exemplifies cooperation with Bangladesh. The question's difficulty stems from the breadth of knowledge required to accurately assess each statement's correctness.  There are no obvious distractors; each statement requires specific knowledge of India's energy partnerships.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the TAPI pipeline:**

1. It originates in Turkmenistan.
2. It is among the world's five largest gas fields.
3. It spans across four countries.
4. It primarily transports crude oil.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline (TAPI) indeed originates in Turkmenistan, making statement 1 correct.  The project's ambition is to be a significant gas pipeline, not a gas field itself, therefore statement 2 is incorrect.  The pipeline's route traverses Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, confirming statement 3. Finally, statement 4 is incorrect; TAPI's primary purpose is natural gas transportation, not crude oil. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Colombo Process:**

1. It focuses on combating transnational organized crime.
2. India recently chaired its first meeting.
3. It primarily involves South Asian countries.
4. Its main objective is to promote regional trade agreements.

Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 1 and 4
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Colombo Process primarily concerns the management of irregular migration, specifically focusing on human trafficking and smuggling.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect.  India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process is factual, making statement 2 correct.  The process's geographic focus is primarily South Asian nations, making statement 3 correct.  Statement 4 is inaccurate; while trade might be a tangential benefit of regional stability, the Colombo Process's core aim isn't focused on trade agreements. Hence, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect.


**3. Consider the following about the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI):**

1. It is published annually by the United Nations.
2.  It ranks countries based on press freedom.
3.  India's ranking consistently places it among the top 50 nations.
4. The index considers factors such as media pluralism and safety of journalists.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The WPFI is compiled by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), not the United Nations, making statement 1 incorrect. The index indeed ranks countries based on press freedom, making statement 2 correct. India's ranking consistently falls significantly below the top 50, making statement 3 incorrect.  The WPFI assesses factors such as media pluralism and journalist safety, making statement 4 correct.  Thus, only statements 2 and 4 are correct.


**4. Consider the following concerning India-Maldives relations:**

1. India launched RuPay card in the Maldives.
2.  A Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) was recently signed.
3.  The Maldives recently withdrew from all military cooperation with India.
4.  India is constructing a new Coast Guard base in the Maldives.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives signifies enhanced financial integration, making statement 1 correct. The signing of a CSA aims to improve the Maldives' foreign exchange management, validating statement 2.  While there have been periods of strained relations, the Maldives has not completely withdrawn from all military cooperation with India, making statement 3 incorrect.  India's ongoing construction of a Coast Guard base in the Maldives strengthens maritime security cooperation, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding Lake Turkana:**

1. It is located in East Africa.
2. It is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
3.  Its primary water source is the Nile River.
4. It has recently undergone a comprehensive survey of its fish stocks.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana's location in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia places it in East Africa, making statement 1 correct.  It is indeed the world's largest permanent desert lake, making statement 2 correct.  However, its primary water source is the Omo River, not the Nile River, making statement 3 incorrect.  A recent survey did assess Lake Turkana's fish potential, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.



**6. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. It grants special powers to the armed forces in designated areas.
2. It is currently in effect in all of India's northeastern states.
3.  It provides immunity to armed forces personnel from legal proceedings without central government sanction.
4.  It was primarily enacted to address insurgency in Jammu and Kashmir.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas," making statement 1 correct.  It is not in effect across all northeastern states but only parts of some, making statement 2 incorrect.  It does provide immunity from legal proceedings except with central government sanction, making statement 3 correct. While initially used in Jammu and Kashmir, its application has expanded to other regions, making statement 4 an oversimplification.  Therefore, statements 1 and 3 are correct, alongside the partially correct statement 4.


**7. Consider the following regarding the India-China border:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border.
2.  The Western Sector of the LAC is largely undisputed.
3.  The Eastern Sector of the LAC largely follows the McMahon Line.
4.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of its territory.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Eastern Sector largely follows the McMahon Line, making statement 3 correct. China's claim over Arunachal Pradesh is well-documented, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are accurate.


**8. Consider the following concerning India-Nepal relations:**

1.  India is Nepal's largest trading partner.
2.  The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 governs the bilateral relationship.
3.  Nepal is a major source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for India.
4.  The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline transports natural gas.


Which of the above statements is/are incorrect?

(a) 3 only
(b) 3 and 4
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India is indeed Nepal's largest trading partner, making statement 1 correct. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 forms the basis of the relationship, making statement 2 correct.  However, Nepal is not a major source of FDI for India; the flow is primarily the other way around, making statement 3 incorrect. The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline transports petroleum products, not natural gas, making statement 4 incorrect. Thus, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.


**9. Consider the following regarding the India-Bhutan relationship:**

1.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner.
2.  The 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was replaced in 2007.
3.  India has constructed several hydroelectric projects in Bhutan.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, making statement 1 correct. The 1949 treaty was renewed, not replaced, in 2007, making statement 2 incorrect. India has indeed constructed several hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, making statement 3 correct.  Bhutan is a member of SAARC, making statement 4 correct.  Therefore, statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the India-Bangladesh relationship:**

Statement 4 is incorrect:  India signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Bhutan, not Nepal, in 2016.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is formally demarcated.
2.  India considers the Johnson Line as its border in the Western Sector.
3.  The Middle Sector of the LAC is largely undisputed.
4.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of Tibet.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the India-China border dispute?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect: The LAC is not formally demarcated, leading to ongoing disputes. Statement 2 is correct: India's claim in the Western Sector is based on the Johnson Line. Statement 3 is correct:  The Middle Sector is relatively less contentious compared to the Western and Eastern Sectors. Statement 4 is also correct: China's claim over Arunachal Pradesh is a major point of contention in the Eastern Sector.

(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect:  While Gelephu is a planned city in Bhutan, it is not a joint India-Bhutan project.  Statement 2 is correct: India's BRO has played a significant role in constructing roads in Bhutan under Project DANTAK. Statement 3 is incorrect: Nepal has not fully endorsed the BBIN initiative due to concerns. Statement 4 is correct:  The "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" is Bhutan's highest civilian award.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INCB is indeed headquartered in Vienna, Austria.  Statement 2 is correct. Bangladesh's inclusion in the CSC reflects expanding regional security cooperation. Statement 3 is also correct. The WPFI is a reputable index published by RSF. However, Statement 4 is incorrect. India's ranking in the WPFI 2024 was significantly lower than the top 10.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.

(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

Kalapani is a tri-junction point, the Treaty of Sagauli is a foundational document in the dispute, Nepal's claim centers on the western Kali river, and India's claim is based on the Pankhagad rivulet as the source of the Kali river.  Therefore, all statements are correct.


Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at being "difficult" by incorporating closely related but incorrect options and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and undergoes periodic reviews.
3. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, is a key institution involved in India's anti-money laundering efforts.
4.  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating financial crimes but is not directly under FATF purview.

How many of the above statements are accurate reflections of FATF's role and India's engagement with it?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of the FATF and India's involvement. The MER's purpose (1) and India's initial adoption date (2) are correctly stated. The ED's role in India's anti-money laundering framework (3) is also accurate. However, statement 4 is misleading. While the MLAT portal aids international cooperation, it's not directly a FATF initiative;  FATF sets standards and evaluates compliance, but doesn't directly operate such portals.  The other options incorrectly minimize the number of accurate statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the UNODC's reports and initiatives:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
2. The "Triple Frontier Area," encompassing Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, is highlighted as a region significantly affected by drug trafficking.
3. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), but does not directly manage regional initiatives like SAWEN.
4. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 is a key publication focusing on illegal wildlife trade and related transnational organized crime, but its relation to drug trafficking is tangential.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the UNODC's work and findings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly reflect information from the UNODC's reports.  Statement 3 is partially correct; the UNODC is the secretariat for UNTOC, but it's inaccurate to say it *doesn't* manage regional initiatives.  While it doesn't directly operate SAWEN, it collaborates and supports such networks.  Statement 4 is a distractor; the wildlife report is relevant, but the phrasing suggesting a tangential link to drug trafficking is designed to confuse.  Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.


**3. Consider the following about India's relations with its neighbours:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh engage in military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN, but not under any specific multilateral platform.
3. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a key infrastructural project enhancing energy cooperation, along with Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant.
4. The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) is a significant agreement for enhanced connectivity between India and Bangladesh, but its operationalization does not involve the use of Chittagong and Mongla Ports.


How many of the statements above correctly describe aspects of India-Bangladesh relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the strong trade and energy cooperation between India and Bangladesh.  Statement 2 is partially incorrect; while SAMPRITI and MILAN are bilateral exercises, they contribute to the broader context of defence cooperation within regional frameworks like SAARC and BIMSTEC.  Statement 4 is a distractor.  The PIWTT does indeed enhance connectivity, and the use of Chittagong and Mongla ports is directly related to its operationalization. Thus, only three statements are fully accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the ASEAN-India relationship:**

1.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), signed in 2009, aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties.
2. India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN countries under AITIGA.
3. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA reviewed the agreement's progress and future directions but did not reveal any significant changes in trade balance.
4.  ASEAN+6 is a regional cooperation framework comprising ASEAN members plus Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US, all engaging in 6 priority areas of cooperation.

How many of these statements accurately depict the ASEAN-India relationship?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes AITIGA's objective.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India generally has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN.  Statement 3 is factually accurate, reflecting the nature of such joint committee meetings.  Statement 4 accurately describes the ASEAN+6 framework and its broad areas of cooperation.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its tenth member.
2.  The SCO's cooperation programs focus solely on economic development and trade agreements.
3. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 outlines ambitious goals for regional integration and security cooperation, but omits any anti-drug initiatives.
4.  The SCO member states endorsed the Initiative ‘On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development’, but its practical implications remain unclear.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect recent developments and activities within the SCO?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect; the SCO addresses security concerns and counter-terrorism alongside economic issues. Statement 3 is false; anti-drug strategies are a key component of the SCO's agenda. Statement 4, while mentioning a true endorsement, is vague and doesn't provide a clear picture of the initiative's impact, making it a weak statement.  Therefore, only one statement is fully accurate.


These MCQs demand precise factual knowledge and careful analysis to avoid the carefully constructed distractors.  They aim for a high difficulty level suitable for competitive examinations.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia from India has been re-elected to the INCB for a third term.
2.  The INCB is primarily responsible for monitoring the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption.
3.  The INCB's mandate includes regulating the global production and trade of cannabis.
4.  The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is factual.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB works to combat drug trafficking, which can be linked to corruption, its primary focus is on the implementation of the UN drug control conventions, not specifically the UN Convention against Corruption. That falls under the purview of other UN bodies. Statement 3 is partially correct.  The INCB monitors the international drug control treaties and the legal and illicit production and trade of controlled substances, including cannabis,  but it doesn't directly regulate them. Its role is more about monitoring and reporting. Statement 4 is incorrect. The INCB is an independent body established under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 and operates independently, although it collaborates with the UNODC.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 contain elements of truth, although not entirely accurate in their presentation.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

3.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework used by India to combat money laundering.
4.  The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the FATF.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding the FATF's operations and India's involvement?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the purpose of the FATF's MER.  Statement 2 is correct; India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the PMLA, 2002, as a crucial piece of legislation in India's anti-money laundering efforts. Statement 4 is incorrect. The FATF is an inter-governmental body; it doesn't have a secretariat in the same way the UNODC does for other conventions.  The FATF itself is the coordinating body. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following about the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC):**

1.  The UNODC released the World Wildlife Crime Report in 2024.
2.  The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
3.  The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is aimed at reducing illicit arms trafficking.
4.  The UNODC's Annual Report on World Drug Day focuses primarily on the global production of coca leaves.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the UNODC's activities and reports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the UNODC did indeed release a World Wildlife Crime Report in 2024.  Statement 2 is also correct; the UNODC serves as the secretariat for UNTOC. Statement 3 is correct; the GFP is a key UNODC initiative to combat illicit firearms. Statement 4 is incorrect. While the UNODC's World Drug Day report covers various aspects of drug abuse, its focus is broader than just coca leaf production; it examines a wider range of drugs and their global impact. Therefore, three out of the four statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the ASEAN-India relationship:**

1.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner within ASEAN.
2.  India and Singapore have signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).
3.  India has a trade surplus with ASEAN countries.
4.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) primarily focuses on economic cooperation among its members.

How many of these statements correctly describe the India-ASEAN relationship?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Singapore is indeed a significant trading partner for India within ASEAN.  Statement 2 is correct; India and Singapore have a CECA in place. Statement 3 is incorrect; India generally has a trade deficit with ASEAN countries, not a surplus. Statement 4 is incorrect; the ARF's primary focus is on political and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region, not primarily economic matters.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the India-ASEAN relationship.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's participation in multilateral organizations:**

1.  India is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
2.  India is a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
3.  India is a member of the G7.
4.  India participates in the East Asia Summit (EAS).

How many of the above statements correctly identify India's membership or participation in these international bodies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India is a member of the SCO. Statement 2 is incorrect; India is not a permanent member of the UN Security Council (only the P5 are). Statement 3 is incorrect; India is not a permanent member of the G7; it is often invited as a guest or partner. Statement 4 is correct; India actively participates in the EAS.  Thus, three of the statements accurately reflect India's involvement in these organizations.


**6. Consider the following regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  The IMEC is intended to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
2.  The IMEC is primarily focused on promoting military cooperation among the participating regions.
3.  The IMEC is a project solely driven by the Indian government.
4.  The IMEC aims to facilitate trade and investment flows between the three regions.

How many of the above statements accurately represent the goals and scope of the IMEC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the IMEC's aim to improve connectivity. Statement 2 is incorrect; the IMEC is primarily an economic initiative, not a military one. Statement 3 is incorrect; the IMEC is a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders from India, the Middle East, and Europe. Statement 4 is correct; the IMEC intends to boost trade and investment.  Therefore, three statements accurately portray the IMEC.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Group of Seven (G7):**

1.  The G7 has a permanent secretariat based in Brussels.
2.  The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries.

How many of the statements above accurately reflect the structure and activities of the G7?

(a) Only one

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent secretariat; its leadership rotates annually. Statement 2 is correct; the PGII is a key G7 initiative. Statement 3 is correct; the presidency rotates among the member states. Statement 4 is incorrect; the G7 includes countries from North America and beyond Europe.  Therefore, only two of the statements are accurate descriptions of the G7.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India has the largest population among Commonwealth members. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Commonwealth is an intergovernmental organization focusing on political and economic cooperation, not a military alliance. Statement 3 is incorrect; the Commonwealth Secretariat is in London, not Geneva. Statement 4 is correct; India did host the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Therefore, only two of the statements accurately describe the Commonwealth.


**9. Consider the following concerning the BRICS grouping:**

1.  BRICS is primarily an economic alliance.
2.  All BRICS nations are members of the G7.
3.  The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) is an alternative payment system.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; Sweden recently joined NATO. Statement 2 is correct; NATO funding is based on GNI contributions. Statement 3 is incorrect; Ukraine is not yet a member of NATO, despite applying. Statement 4 is incorrect; NATO's main function is collective defense and security, not global economic development.

Statement 3 is correct; SAMPRITI and MILAN are examples of ongoing military exercises fostering defense cooperation between India and Bangladesh.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India did participate in the G7 summit as an outreach country. Statement 2 is correct; Belarus joined the SCO. Statement 3 is correct; India was elected Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.

**1. Consider the following:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention)
2. The South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)
3. The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network
4. The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002

How many of the above are international initiatives or agreements aimed at combating transnational organized crime or corruption?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options represent international efforts to combat transnational organized crime or corruption.  The UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention, is a landmark treaty establishing a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in preventing and combating transnational organized crime. SAWEN is a regional initiative specifically focused on wildlife crime in South Asia, a significant aspect of transnational organized crime.  GlobE is a global network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities, promoting international cooperation in fighting corruption. Lastly, the SAARC Convention directly addresses the trafficking of women and children, a major form of transnational organized crime within the South Asian region.  Therefore, all four options contribute to international efforts to tackle these issues.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal
4. The  India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement

Which of the above are specifically Indian measures or initiatives designed to combat money laundering or terrorist financing?


(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA and UAPA are both Indian laws directly addressing money laundering and terrorist financing. The PMLA provides a legal framework for preventing and prosecuting money laundering, while the UAPA focuses on unlawful activities, including those linked to terrorism, which often involve money laundering. The MLAT Portal facilitates international cooperation in investigations, crucial for tackling transnational money laundering. The India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement, while important for financial stability, is not a direct measure against money laundering or terrorist financing in the same way as the other three options.  Therefore, options 1, 2, and 3 are the most relevant Indian measures to combat these specific financial crimes.


**3. Consider the following regions:**

1. The Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay)
2. The Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle: Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)
3. The Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent: Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)
4. The Sahel region (Africa)

How many of the above are regions identified as significant centers for drug production or trafficking according to UNODC reports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Triple Frontier Area, Golden Triangle, and Golden Crescent are all notoriously known for drug production and trafficking, frequently highlighted in UNODC reports. The Triple Frontier Area, situated where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is a hub for drug trafficking due to its porous borders. The Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent are historically significant for opium production and the trafficking of heroin and other narcotics. While the Sahel region faces numerous challenges including drug trafficking, it is not as prominently featured in UNODC reports as the other three regions, which are consistently identified as major drug production and trafficking hotspots. Therefore, three out of the four regions are accurately described as major drug production and trafficking areas.


**4. Consider the following statements:**

1. Cannabis is the most abused drug globally.
2. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is a United Nations agency.
3.  Jagjit Pavadia is the current head of the UNODC.

How many of the above statements are factually correct based on recent reports and information?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct:  UNODC reports consistently show cannabis as the most widely abused drug worldwide. Statement 2 is correct: The INCB is indeed a UN agency responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties. Statement 4 is also correct: Canada is one of the countries that have legalized cannabis. However, statement 3 is incorrect; Jagjit Pavadia is associated with the INCB, not the UNODC.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following:**

1. The Commonwealth Games
2. The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)
3. The India-UN Development Fund Commonwealth Sub Window
4. The  CHOGM

How many of the above are related to the Commonwealth of Nations or its activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options are directly linked to the Commonwealth of Nations. The Commonwealth Games are a major multi-sport event held among Commonwealth countries. The CLGF is a dedicated forum focused on local governance within the Commonwealth. The India-UN Development Fund Commonwealth Sub Window is a specific initiative funded by India to support Commonwealth development. Finally, CHOGM refers to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the highest decision-making body of the Commonwealth.  Thus, all four elements are clearly associated with the Commonwealth's activities and initiatives.


**6. Consider the following international organizations:**

1. OPEC+
2. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

OPEC+ is focused on coordinating oil production and prices, a major economic activity. The AIIB is explicitly designed to fund infrastructure projects, promoting economic development. The GCC aims at economic cooperation among its member states. The Five Eyes Alliance, while having economic implications, primarily focuses on intelligence sharing and security cooperation.  Therefore, OPEC+, AIIB, and GCC all have a clear economic focus, while the Five Eyes Alliance does not.


**7. Consider the following:**

1. The BRICS New Development Bank
2. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement
3. The BRICS Grain Exchange
4. The G4 nations

How many of the above are initiatives or groups directly related to the BRICS nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BRICS New Development Bank, the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement, and the BRICS Grain Exchange are all initiatives specifically created or championed by the BRICS nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa). The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, Japan) is a separate group pushing for UN Security Council reform.  Hence, three of the options directly relate to BRICS.


**8. Consider the following:**

1. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)
2. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
3. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)

How many of the above are regional organizations or agreements involving India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AITIGA is a trade agreement between ASEAN and India. SAARC is a regional organization of South Asian nations, including India. BIMSTEC is a regional grouping including India and countries from South Asia and Southeast Asia. ASEAN is a Southeast Asian organization that has an agreement with India.  Therefore, all four options represent regional organizations or agreements with India's participation.

1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
2. The Biological Weapons Convention
3. The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)
4. The Universal Postal Union (UPU)

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Rome Statute for the ICC all deal with international law and specific global concerns. The CWC and Biological Weapons Convention address weapons of mass destruction, while the Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court to prosecute serious international crimes.  The Universal Postal Union, while a significant international organization, is focused on postal services and not directly on disarmament or international criminal law. Therefore, three of the four options are accurately classified as international treaties or organizations concerned with disarmament, international law, or specific global issues.


**10. Consider the following:**

1. The  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA)
2. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023

How many of the above are related to India's national security, military affairs, or internal security issues?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in designated areas, directly impacting internal security. The Inter-services Organisations Act addresses command and discipline within India's military structure. Operation Vijay was a military operation undertaken to address a national security challenge. The NSCS is a key body involved in advising the government on national security matters. Thus, all four options are intrinsically connected to aspects of India's national security, military organization, or internal security concerns.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Yangtze River is a major river in China; the Kunlunshan Mountains are located in China; and the Gobi Desert, while also extending into Mongolia, is the largest desert *in China*. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Taklimakan Desert is the largest desert in China, but it is *not* the largest desert in the world; that title belongs to the Antarctic Desert.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe China's geographical features. This illustrates the importance of accurate comparative data when describing geographical features.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims to be high, incorporating plausible distractors and demanding precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding international initiatives aimed at infrastructure development:**

1. The PGII aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, focusing on sustainable infrastructure.
2. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is primarily driven by the G7.
3. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) focuses solely on maritime security.
4. Apulia Food Systems initiative is a G7-led effort aimed at enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) indeed aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 with a focus on sustainable, inclusive, and quality infrastructure.  Statement 2 is also correct; the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a G7-led effort. Statement 4 is correct as Apulia Food Systems is a G7 initiative focused on food security and sustainable agriculture.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the FSOI is a G7 initiative related to oceans, it encompasses broader issues than just maritime security; it likely includes environmental protection and sustainable use of ocean resources.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**2. Consider the following statements concerning the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) and its recent activities:**

1. NAM's recent call highlights its relevance to Global South nations.
2.  The US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" includes only countries that directly engage in acts of terrorism.
3.  Countries on the US list face only diplomatic repercussions.
4.  Besides Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and Syria are also on this US list.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. NAM's advocacy for Cuba demonstrates its continued relevance to the Global South. Statement 4 is also correct; the US list includes Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and Syria. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The US list includes countries *allegedly* sponsoring terrorism; the determination isn't solely based on direct acts of terrorism but also on accusations of support or harboring terrorist groups.  Statement 3 is incorrect as well.  Being on the list leads to significant unilateral economic, commercial, and financial sanctions by the US, beyond mere diplomatic consequences. Thus, only statements 1 and 4 are accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Commonwealth and India's role within it:**

1.  India contributes the largest amount of funding to the Commonwealth.
2. India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
3. The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, has a five-year funding cycle.
4. India represents over 50% of the Commonwealth's total population.

How many of the statements above are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are correct. India did indeed host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, and the Commonwealth Sub Window operates on a five-year funding schedule. Statement 4 is also largely correct, as India represents nearly 60% of the Commonwealth population, which is above 50%. However, statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant contributor, it's not the largest financially.  Therefore, three out of the four statements are true.



**4. Consider these aspects of the IAEA and its programs:**

1. The IAEA's ITDB solely focuses on nuclear material theft incidents.
2. Atoms4Food exclusively uses nuclear technology for crop improvement.
3. Atoms4NetZero promotes only nuclear fission for achieving net-zero emissions.
4. The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program utilizes nuclear science.

How many of the statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 4 is correct. The IAEA does integrate nuclear science into zoonotic disease management.  Statement 1 is largely correct, focusing on illicit trafficking which includes theft, but it also monitors and reports on other incidents related to nuclear material.  Statement 2 is too narrow; Atoms4Food likely uses nuclear techniques for a broader range of food security improvements beyond just crop enhancements. Statement 3 is also an oversimplification; Atoms4NetZero might encompass other nuclear-related technologies beyond just fission for achieving net-zero emissions.  Therefore, only three statements are completely accurate.


**5. Consider the following features of India's engagement with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):**

1.  India is categorized as a "role-modeling" country in the ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index 2024.
2.  The ITU's GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments across all countries.
3.  Most countries assessed by the ITU's GCI 2024 are at the "establishing" or "evolving" stages.
4.  India's high ranking in the GCI 2024 is solely due to its robust cybersecurity infrastructure.

How many of these statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. India is indeed in Tier 1 ("role-modeling") in the GCI 2024, the index assesses cybersecurity worldwide, and most nations are in lower tiers.  However, statement 4 is an oversimplification.  India's high ranking is likely a result of a combination of factors beyond just infrastructure, including policy, legislation, and awareness programs. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**6. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and India's interactions with it:**

1. The FATF's MER process involves peer review by its members.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
3. The PMLA, 2002, is the only relevant legal framework used by India to combat money laundering.
4. The FIU-IND was established in 2004 to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The FATF's evaluation involves peer review, India's first MER was in 2010, and the FIU-IND's establishment date is accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the PMLA, 2002, is crucial, other legal frameworks, like the UAPA, 1967, also play a significant role in combating money laundering and related crimes. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are completely accurate.


**7. Consider the following aspects of the UNODC's reports:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC’s reports mention the “Golden Triangle” and “Golden Crescent” regions as primary drug production areas.
3. The UNODC's reports focus exclusively on illegal drug trafficking.
4.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights Uruguay as a country where cannabis is legalized.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Cannabis is highlighted as the most widely abused drug, the report mentions the geographic regions (now renamed "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent"), and Uruguay's cannabis legalization is mentioned. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the UNODC primarily deals with illicit trafficking, its reports and work also encompass broader issues related to drug use, prevention, and treatment.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**8. Consider the following about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1. IMEC is expected to significantly impact global connectivity.
2. IMEC's primary focus is on enhancing energy security.
3. IMEC is a solely bilateral initiative between India and the Middle East.
4. IMEC's development is entirely funded by India.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that IMEC is considered a cornerstone of global connectivity. Statement 2 is incorrect; while energy might be a component, the corridor's scope is broader than just energy security. Statement 3 is incorrect; IMEC is a multi-regional initiative, not just bilateral.  Statement 4 is incorrect, as funding sources are unlikely to be solely from India.  Therefore, only one statement is accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its tenth member.
2.  The SCO's anti-drug strategy extends to 2029.
3.  The SCO summit in Astana focused primarily on economic cooperation.
4. India played a leading role in shaping the SCO's 2025-2027 counter-terrorism program.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  Belarus's membership and the timeframe of the anti-drug strategy are accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; while economic cooperation is a part of the SCO's agenda, the Astana summit likely had a broader focus encompassing security and other areas.  Statement 4 is not directly supported by the provided text; while India participates, the text doesn't specify a leading role in shaping the counter-terrorism program. Therefore, only two statements are definitively correct.


**10. Consider the following features of the Group of Seven (G7) and its initiatives:**

1. The G7 operates with a permanent, fixed organizational structure.
2.  The PGII is a G7 initiative focused on infrastructure projects in developing nations.
3. The G7's annual agenda is set by its rotating presidency.
4.  The G7's initiatives primarily focus on resolving global economic crises.

How many of the above statements are correct?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The PGII is a G7 initiative for infrastructure, and the rotating presidency sets the yearly agenda. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure. Statement 4 is an oversimplification; while economic issues are important, the G7's scope extends beyond solely addressing economic crises.  It deals with a wide range of global issues. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**11. Consider the following statements regarding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF):**

1.  India signed agreements under IPEF covering clean economy, fair economy, and an overarching arrangement.
2. The IPEF Upskilling Initiative focuses exclusively on providing digital skills training for women.
3. The IPEF Critical Mineral Dialogue is solely focused on mapping mineral resources.
4.  India holds the chairmanship of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the text mentions India signing agreements under those pillars.  Statement 3 is partially correct; resource mapping is part of the dialogue, but it also involves trade flows and collaboration. However, statement 2 is too narrow; while women are a primary target, the initiative likely includes broader upskilling. Statement 4 is incorrect; India is elected Vice-Chair, not Chairman.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**12. Consider the following statements regarding India's initiatives to address internal conflicts:**

1. The NLFT Peace Accord focused on the reintegration of surrendered militants.
2. The Bru-Reang Agreement addressed a long-standing displacement issue between Tripura and Mizoram.
3. The Karbi Anglong Agreement involved the surrender of armed groups and a developmental package.
4. All these agreements involved significant financial contributions from external international organizations.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the respective peace accords. However, statement 4 is incorrect; the text doesn't indicate external international funding for these agreements. The funding likely came from the Indian government.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**13. Consider the following regarding India's contributions to global counter-terrorism efforts:**

1. India contributed to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund.
2. India's contribution supported UNOCT programs on Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Countering Terrorist Travel (CTT).
3. The UNOCT was established in 2017.
4. India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund was primarily aimed at strengthening global military capabilities.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate.  India did contribute to the fund, the contribution's purpose is correctly stated, and the UNOCT's establishment date is correct.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the focus was on strengthening member-state capabilities, not solely military ones.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**14. Consider the following about the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and its report:**

1. SIPRI's 2023 report placed India among the top four military spenders globally.
2. SIPRI was established in 1966.
3. SIPRI's reports exclusively focus on military expenditure.
4. The 2023 SIPRI report ranked India higher than Russia in military spending.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. India's ranking and SIPRI's founding year are accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; SIPRI's work extends beyond just military expenditure to broader peace and security research. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the report placed India fourth, behind the US, China, and Russia.  Therefore, only two statements are correct.


**15. Consider the following about India-Singapore relations:**

1. The India-Singapore relationship is categorized as a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
2. Singapore is India’s largest trading partner in ASEAN.
3.  The India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) has resulted in a net trade surplus for India.
4.  Project Nexus aims to link India's UPI with other countries' payment systems.

How many of the above statements are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The partnership status is accurate, Singapore's position as India’s largest ASEAN trade partner is correct, and Project Nexus's objective is accurately described. However, statement 3 is incorrect; India is a net importer under the CECA.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Vietnamese Prime Minister's visit is mentioned, and the existence of joint military exercises is stated.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the text doesn't mention a recently signed CEPA. Statement 4 is an oversimplification; while counter-terrorism might be a component, the relationship encompasses broader areas of cooperation.  Therefore, only two statements are entirely accurate.


**17. Consider the following regarding the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India's engagement:**

1. India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996.
2. The ASEAN Future Forum was proposed by India at the 43rd ASEAN Summit.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India-Bangladesh relations:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  Military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN are conducted between India and Bangladesh.
3.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a key infrastructure project connecting the two nations.
4.  Bangladesh is a member of the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct.  Bangladesh consistently ranks as India's largest trading partner in South Asia, reflecting strong economic ties.

2.  The Jamuna River, part of the Brahmaputra, is its longest river.
3.  Approximately 60% of the Sundarbans mangrove forest lies within Bangladesh.
4.  Dhaka is its capital city, situated on the Bay of Bengal.

How many of the above statements accurately describe Bangladesh's geography and political features?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Bangladesh borders Myanmar to its southeast. The Jamuna River, a major distributary of the Brahmaputra, is indeed its longest river.  A significant portion (approximately 60%) of the Sundarbans mangrove forest is located within Bangladesh. However, statement 4 is incorrect; Dhaka, the capital, is not located on the Bay of Bengal, but rather inland on the Buriganga River.  Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Bhutan.
2.  An electricity corridor is planned from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam to facilitate India-Bangladesh power exchange.
3.  The TAPI pipeline facilitates natural gas transportation between India, Nepal, and Bangladesh.

(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct.  The planned electricity corridor between Katihar and Bornagar aims to enhance power trade between India and Bangladesh. India and Bhutan have a history of collaboration on several hydropower projects, including those mentioned (Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu). However, statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali projects are collaborations between India and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The TAPI pipeline (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) does not involve Bangladesh.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate, making (b) the correct option.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.

(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect India's anti-money laundering efforts.  The PMLA, 2002, is a cornerstone legislation. The FIU-IND is vital for collecting and sharing financial information. The MLAT portal enhances international cooperation. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established much earlier than 2004; its origins date back to 1956.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct, making (a) the correct choice.


**5. Consider the following regarding the UNODC's World Drug Day report:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the findings of the UNODC's World Drug Day report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly reflect aspects of the UNODC's report. Amphetamines are indeed listed among the most widely abused drugs. The Golden Triangle region (renamed the Death Triangle) comprises Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, known for drug production and trafficking.  Cannabis legalization in Canada, Uruguay, and parts of the US is accurately mentioned.  Therefore, option (c) is correct.



**6. Consider the following statements regarding India-Maldives relations:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives to boost financial inclusion.
2.  Operation Neer, conducted in 2014, provided water to the Maldives during a crisis.

4.  The Maldives recently adopted a pro-China policy, leading to the withdrawal of Indian military personnel.


Which of the above statements accurately depict aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe elements of India-Maldives relations.  The introduction of the RuPay card aims to improve financial access. Operation Neer demonstrated India's support during a water crisis. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure undertaking. However, statement 4 is inaccurate. While there have been shifts in the Maldives' foreign policy, a complete withdrawal of Indian military personnel hasn't occurred. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct, making (a) the correct answer.


**7. Consider the following about the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):**

1. India was elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council.
2. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement includes a Crisis Response Network for collective emergency responses.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the IPEF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the IPEF's structure and objectives. India's role as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council is factual. The inclusion of a Crisis Response Network and a Labor Rights Advisory Board are also key features of the framework.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The IPEF's focus is broader than just free trade agreements; it encompasses various aspects of economic cooperation, including supply chain resilience, clean energy, and digital trade.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1.  Belarus recently joined the SCO, becoming its tenth member.
2.  The SCO's 24th summit was held in Astana, Kazakhstan.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding the SCO?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Belarus's accession to the SCO and the location of the 24th summit are accurately stated. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  While the SCO has a security component, its focus extends beyond military alliances to encompass economic and cultural cooperation.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; India is not a founding member but joined later. Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Group of Seven (G7):**

1.  The G7 operates under a permanent, fixed structure with a pre-determined annual agenda.

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The PGII and the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative are indeed G7 initiatives. However, statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a fixed structure; its presidency rotates annually, setting the agenda. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India was invited as an Outreach Country, not a member state.  Therefore, only two statements are accurate, making (b) the correct option.


**10. Consider the following regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors illicit nuclear material trafficking.
2.  Atoms4Food is an IAEA program focused on improving global food security using nuclear techniques.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe IAEA activities. The ITDB tracks illicit nuclear material. Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero are genuine IAEA programs. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the IAEA is involved in nuclear safety and security, its primary focus is not on weapons proliferation; it is more focused on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  Option (b) would be the correct answer if the question was asking how many of the statements are correct.  There is a discrepancy in the question, which should be changed to 'Which of the above statements accurately describe the IAEA's activities and programs?'.  Then (b) would be the correct answer.


**11. Consider the following about the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):**

1. The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
2. India is categorized as a "role-modelling" country in the GCI 2024.
3. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level commitments to cybersecurity.
4. Most countries are in Tier 5, demonstrating weak cybersecurity commitments, according to the GCI 2024.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of the ITU's GCI 2024. The ITU did release the index, India was recognized as a role model, and the index assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments. However, statement 4 is incorrect; most countries are not in Tier 5 (the lowest tier). The report shows a range of performance across different countries.  Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer.

4. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, forming the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the geographical features mentioned?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three

All four statements accurately describe the geographical features mentioned. Lake Turkana's location, Mount Kilimanjaro's status as Africa's highest peak and its volcanic nature, the Lipulekh Pass's location and its significance for pilgrimage, and the Suez Canal's function and location are all correctly stated. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. China is indeed India's largest trading partner in goods. The Galwan clash was the deadliest since 1962. The Depsang Plains hold strategic military importance. However, statement 2 is incorrect. The LAC is not formally demarcated; it's a disputed line.  Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer.


**14. Consider the following regarding India-Singapore relations:**

1. Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN.
2. India and Singapore have signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).
3. Exercise SIMBEX is a joint military exercise between India and Singapore's air forces.
4. Project Nexus aims to link India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with Singapore's Fast Payment System.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India-Singapore relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Singapore is India's largest trading partner within ASEAN.  A CECA exists between the two countries. Project Nexus links UPI with Singapore's payment system. However, statement 3 is incorrect; SIMBEX is a naval exercise, not an air force exercise. Therefore, only three statements are accurate, making (c) the correct answer.


**15. Consider the following statements about India-Vietnam relations:**

1. The relationship between India and Vietnam is characterized by a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership.
2.  India and Vietnam conduct regular joint military exercises.

4. India's major exports to Vietnam include textiles and agricultural products.


How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India-Vietnam relations?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. India and Vietnam do have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. They conduct joint military exercises. Vietnam is an ASEAN member. The nature of trade between the two countries is not explicitly detailed, but it is plausible that textiles and agricultural products form part of India's exports to Vietnam.  Therefore, all four statements are accurate, making (d) the correct answer.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on economics and international relations, designed to be challenging and incorporating plausible distractors.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following initiatives aimed at fostering global infrastructure development:**

1.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)
4.  The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition

How many of the above initiatives are directly focused on promoting sustainable energy development in developing nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGII, while encompassing sustainable infrastructure, has a broader scope than just sustainable energy.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative explicitly targets clean energy investment in Africa, making it directly focused on sustainable energy development in developing nations. The FSOI and the Oil Price Cap Coalition, while relevant to global economic stability and potentially impacting energy markets, are not directly aimed at promoting sustainable energy development in developing countries.  Their objectives lie in broader areas of ocean sustainability and managing global oil prices respectively. Therefore, only one initiative – "Energy for Growth in Africa" – directly addresses sustainable energy development in developing nations.


**2. Consider the following measures adopted by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing:**

1.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3.  Establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
4.  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal

How many of the above are primarily legislative frameworks designed to create the legal basis for combating financial crimes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA and UAPA are both legislative acts providing the legal framework for addressing money laundering and terrorist financing respectively.  The FIU-IND is an institution responsible for collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence, not a legislative framework itself. The MLAT Portal is an initiative to facilitate international cooperation, not a primary legislative framework. Therefore, only two of the listed measures are primarily legislative frameworks for combating financial crimes.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with the Commonwealth:**

1.  India is the largest member of the Commonwealth by population.
2.  India is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth.
3.  India has hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).
4.  India established a Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's role and engagement within the Commonwealth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: India indeed represents a significant portion (approximately 60%) of the Commonwealth's population. Statement 3 is also correct: India hosted the CHOGM in 1983 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Statement 4 is also correct:  India did establish a Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while India is a significant contributor, it is not the *largest* financial contributor to the Commonwealth.  Therefore, three of the four statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following international organizations and their key initiatives:**

1.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its Atoms4Food program.
2.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and its World Wildlife Crime Report.
3.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MER).
4.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI).

How many of the above pairings correctly link an international organization to one of its major initiatives or reports?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairings correctly link an organization to a key initiative or report. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program uses nuclear techniques to improve food security; the UNODC publishes the World Wildlife Crime Report; the FATF conducts MERs to assess countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures; and the ITU publishes the GCI to assess cybersecurity commitments.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to regional cooperation:**

1.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)
2.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
3.  The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
4.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)

How many of the above initiatives involve India as a key participating member or nation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India is a key member of BIMSTEC, SCO, and IPEF.  The IMEC also involves India as a crucial partner in its development. Therefore, all four initiatives include India as a key participant.


**6. Consider the following international conventions and agreements:**

1.  The Chemical Weapons Convention
2.  The Biological Weapons Convention
3.  The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)
4.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC)

How many of these agreements have been ratified by India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  The provided text explicitly states that India is a signatory and party to the Chemical Weapons Convention and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.  While the text doesn't explicitly state ratification for the others,  it is highly likely that India, as a responsible global player, would have ratified all of these significant international agreements. The UNTOC is mentioned as ratified by India in the provided text.  Therefore, it's highly probable that all four agreements have been ratified by India.


**7. Consider the following reports and indices:**

1.  The World Military Expenditure report (SIPRI)
2.  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) (ITU)
3.  The World Drug Day Report (UNODC)
4.  The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) (FATF)


How many of these reports/indices are published by an intergovernmental organization?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), while independent, frequently collaborates with and informs intergovernmental bodies. The Global Cybersecurity Index is published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the World Drug Day Report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), and the Mutual Evaluation Report by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).  All four are therefore produced by or in close collaboration with intergovernmental organizations.




**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004.
3. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956.
4.  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.
5. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, plays a significant role.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's anti-money laundering efforts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All five statements are correct.  The PMLA, 2002, forms the core legislative framework for preventing money laundering in India. The FIU-IND is the central agency for receiving, processing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing. The ED is a key enforcement agency under the PMLA. The MLAT portal enhances international cooperation in combating money laundering.  Finally, the UAPA, 1967, while primarily focused on unlawful activities, also plays a role in addressing money laundering linked to terrorism.  Therefore, all statements accurately represent aspects of India's anti-money laundering strategy.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect the findings of the UNODC's World Drug Day Report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct.  The Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle) and Triple Frontier Area are accurately identified as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking.  Cannabis legalization in Canada and Uruguay is also a factual statement. Cocaine is indeed listed among the most abused drugs. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the report indicates that Cannabis is the most abused drug globally, not amphetamines.

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Only statements 3 and 2 are correct. The PGII's funding goal and the existence of the FSOI are accurate. However, the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on clean energy, not sustainable agriculture (incorrect in statement 1). The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition doesn't directly relate to food security (incorrect in statement 4), and Apulia Food Systems is focused on food security and sustainable agriculture, not clean energy in Africa (incorrect in statement 5).

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. India did indeed host the Commonwealth Games in 2010 and the CHOGM in 1983. The Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund is also a fact. However, statement 1 is incorrect; while India is the largest member by population, it represents closer to 60%, not over 70%. Statement 3 is also incorrect; India is the fourth-largest contributor, not the second largest.

1.  EFTA is a customs union.
2.  Three EFTA members participate in the European Economic Area (EEA).
3.  The TEPA established a free trade area between India and EFTA.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-US relations?


(a) 2, 3, and 4
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India has a trade *surplus*, not a deficit, with the United States.

Statement 2 is correct.  This designation signifies the deepening strategic partnership in defense.

Statement 3 is correct. The 2+2 dialogues have become a key mechanism for high-level strategic discussions.

**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council.
2. The IPEF Crisis Response Network.
3. The IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board.
4. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).
5. The ASEAN Future Forum.

How many of the above are initiatives directly related to strengthening supply chains or addressing supply chain disruptions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IPEF Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and the UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) are all directly involved in strengthening supply chains or responding to disruptions. The ARF and ASEAN Future Forum, while important international organizations, do not have a primary focus on supply chain issues.  Therefore, only three of the listed entities directly address supply chain challenges. The UN-GSCF, although not explicitly listed as an IPEF initiative, falls under the broader context of global supply chain resilience, making it relevant to the question's core theme. The other options are incorrect because they either include initiatives unrelated to supply chains or miscount the number of relevant entities.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).
2. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Strategy until 2035.
3. The Group of Seven (G7) Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).
4. The BRICS New Development Bank.
5. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA).

How many of the above initiatives aim to significantly enhance infrastructure development or investment in developing nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IMEC, G7's PGII, and the BRICS New Development Bank are all explicitly designed to fund or facilitate infrastructure projects in developing nations.  The SCO Development Strategy, while encompassing broad development goals, doesn't specifically target infrastructure in the same focused manner.  AITIGA focuses on reducing trade barriers, not primarily on infrastructure development. Therefore, three of the listed initiatives directly aim at boosting infrastructure development. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes initiatives with broader developmental goals, not solely focused on infrastructure. Options (a) and (b) undercount the number of initiatives directly related to infrastructure development.


**3. Consider the following statements about international economic organizations:**

1. The Group of Twenty (G20) has a permanent secretariat.
2. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) includes Australia and New Zealand as founding members.
3. The BRICS New Development Bank is headquartered in Shanghai.
4. The Commonwealth's largest member by population is India.
5.  The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is currently India's largest trading partner bloc.

How many of the above statements are factually correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3, 4, and 5 are factually correct. The BRICS New Development Bank is indeed headquartered in Shanghai. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth by population.  The GCC is currently India's largest trading partner bloc. Statement 1 is incorrect; the G20 lacks a permanent secretariat. Statement 2 is incorrect; Australia and New Zealand are not founding members of ASEAN. Therefore, four of the statements are accurate. The other options misrepresent the number of correct statements.


**4. Consider the following:**

1. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility (EFF).
2. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement.
3. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework.
4. The India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement.
5.  The OPEC+ oil output cuts.

How many of the above mechanisms provide short-term or medium-term liquidity support or financial assistance to member nations or countries facing economic challenges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five options represent mechanisms offering some form of financial assistance or liquidity support.  The IMF EFF provides financial assistance to countries with prolonged economic problems. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement and the SAARC Currency Swap Framework offer short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payments issues. The India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement provides a similar function on a bilateral level. While OPEC+ oil output cuts indirectly impact economies, their primary goal is not direct financial aid but rather price stability, which is a relevant economic factor.  Therefore, all five mechanisms are relevant to providing some form of economic support.  Other options fail to recognize the comprehensive scope of the listed mechanisms.


**5. Consider the following:**

1. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative.
2. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI).
3. The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition.
4. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.
5. The Atoms4NetZero initiative.

How many of the above initiatives are directly led or significantly supported by the G7 or a related group?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, the G7 FSOI, and the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition are all directly led or significantly supported by the G7. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is a broader UN initiative, not primarily driven by the G7. Atoms4NetZero is an IAEA initiative.  Therefore, only three of the listed initiatives are directly associated with the G7. The other options either overcount or undercount the G7-related initiatives.  Understanding the organizational affiliations of these initiatives is crucial for correct identification.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Atoms4Food
2.  Atoms4NetZero
3.  International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles
4.  Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action
5.  Incident and Trafficking Database

Which of the above are key programmes of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)?

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**  The provided text explicitly lists Atoms4Food, Atoms4NetZero, the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles, Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action, and the Incident and Trafficking Database as key IAEA programmes.  Therefore, all five options are correct.  There are no distractors in this case because the text directly supports all the listed programmes. The question tests factual recall of specific IAEA initiatives.  Understanding the IAEA's mandate to promote peaceful uses of nuclear technology and address nuclear safety concerns is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the organization.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  Operation Neer
2.  Vaccine Maitri
3.  Construction of a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll
4.  Providing grants for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs)
5.  Greater Male Connectivity Project

How many of the above are initiatives undertaken by India to strengthen its relations with the Maldives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions all five options – Operation Neer (providing water during a crisis), Vaccine Maitri (supplying vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic), the construction of a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu, providing grants for HICDPs, and the Greater Male Connectivity Project – as examples of India's efforts to bolster its relationship with the Maldives.  The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify specific initiatives within a broader context of bilateral relations. The inclusion of diverse initiatives (humanitarian aid, infrastructure development, and security cooperation) tests the candidate's understanding of the multifaceted nature of India-Maldives ties.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The adoption of a vision for a “Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership”
2.  The launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives
3.  The signing of a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)
4.  The withdrawal of Indian military personnel from the Maldives
5.  The establishment of a joint military base in the Maldives

How many of the above were key outcomes of a recent bilateral visit between the Presidents of India and the Maldives, or reflect the state of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The text mentions the adoption of a vision for a “Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership,” the launch of the RuPay card, and the signing of a Currency Swap Agreement as key outcomes of a recent visit. The "India Out" campaign and the related mention of the withdrawal of Indian military personnel is discussed as a past challenge in the relationship, not a recent outcome. The establishment of a joint military base is not mentioned. Thus, only three of the listed points are directly related to the key outcomes or the current state of India-Maldives relations. The question tests the ability to differentiate between current events and historical context in international relations and to accurately identify key elements from descriptive text.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Operation Safed Sagar
2.  Operation Talwar
3.  Operation Vijay
4.  Operation Crimson Barracuda
5.  Operation Neer

How many of the above are military operations mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The text details Operation Safed Sagar (Indian Air Force), Operation Talwar (Indian Navy), and Operation Vijay (Indian Army) as key components of the Kargil War. It also mentions Operation Crimson Barracuda, an Indian Navy operation conducted under the Combined Maritime Forces. Operation Neer, however, is a humanitarian operation and not a military operation in the traditional sense. Therefore, four of the options are military operations as defined in the context of the provided text. This question tests factual recall and the candidate's ability to distinguish between different types of military and humanitarian operations. The inclusion of both large-scale conflicts and smaller-scale operations tests a nuanced understanding of military actions.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Geneva Protocol of 1925
2.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
3.  The Biological Weapons Convention
4.  The 1949 Geneva Conventions
5.  The Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property

How many of the above are key international treaties related to the regulation of warfare or the protection of specific groups during armed conflict?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text discusses the Geneva Protocol of 1925, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological Weapons Convention, the 1949 Geneva Conventions, and the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property, all of which are significant international treaties concerning the regulation of warfare or the protection of specific groups during armed conflict. The question assesses factual knowledge of international law and treaties, demanding recall of specific treaty names and their general subject matter. The inclusion of treaties from different eras and with varying focuses (chemical weapons, biological weapons, humanitarian law, cultural property) tests a broad understanding of international legal frameworks.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Kurichu
2.  Tala
3.  Chukha
4.  Mangdechhu
5.  Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline

How many of the above are examples of India-Bhutan energy projects or infrastructure initiatives mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu as examples of India-Bhutan energy projects. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is also mentioned, but in the context of energy pipelines generally, not specifically as an India-Bhutan project. Therefore, four of the listed items are examples of India-Bhutan energy projects or infrastructure initiatives. The question tests factual recall and the ability to extract specific details from a larger text. The inclusion of both hydroelectric power projects and pipelines tests an understanding of the diverse energy cooperation between the two countries.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
2.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
3.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)
4.  The Group of Seven (G7)
5.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)


How many of the above are regional or international organizations mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text mentions the IPEF, SCO, BIMSTEC, G7, and SAARC as regional or international organizations.  All five are discussed, albeit briefly in some cases. The question tests factual recall of the names of various international organizations and their basic functions. The inclusion of organizations with widely differing memberships and focuses (economic cooperation, security cooperation, political alliances) tests the candidate's knowledge of the global geopolitical landscape.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  The Gulf of Aden
2.  Somalia
3.  Abu Musa Island
4.  The Senkaku Islands
5.  West Papua

How many of the above are locations or regions mentioned in the provided text that have experienced or are experiencing conflict or geopolitical tensions?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text mentions the Gulf of Aden (in relation to pirate attacks), Somalia (in relation to a terrorist attack), Abu Musa Island (in relation to a territorial dispute between Iran and UAE), the Senkaku Islands (in relation to tensions between China and Japan), and West Papua (in relation to an independence movement). All five locations are mentioned in the context of ongoing or recent conflicts or geopolitical tensions. The question assesses factual recall of places associated with contemporary conflicts and geopolitical issues.  The variety of conflicts (maritime security, terrorism, territorial disputes, separatist movements) tests the candidate’s broad awareness of global hotspots.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)
2.  The Department of Military Affairs (DMA)
3.  Theatre Command
4.  The Kargil Review Committee (KRC)
5.  The Group of Ministers (GoM) that recommended the CDS post

How many of the above are related to India's military structure, defense reforms, or the Kargil War?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text discusses the CDS, DMA, Theatre Command, KRC, and the GoM that recommended the CDS post, all of which are directly related to India's military structure, defense reforms, or the aftermath of the Kargil War. The question tests the candidate's understanding of India's defense mechanisms and the institutional reforms undertaken in recent years. The inclusion of elements related to both organizational structure and post-conflict review demonstrates a thorough understanding of the Indian military system.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  The World Press Freedom Index (WPFI)
2.  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3.  The International Atomic Energy Agency's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
4.  The Body Roundness Index (BRI)
5.  The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) project


How many of the above are indices, databases, or projects mentioned in the provided text?


(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text mentions the WPFI, GCI, ITDB, BRI and the SKA project, all of which are either indices, databases, or large-scale projects. The question tests the candidate's ability to identify different types of data sources and research initiatives and to categorize them accurately. The inclusion of indices from various sectors (press freedom, cybersecurity, health) and large-scale scientific projects tests the candidate's understanding of how data is collected and used in different fields.



Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar
2. Operation Talwar
3. Operation Vijay
4. Kargil Review Committee

How many of the above are directly related to the Kargil War?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four elements are directly linked to the Kargil War. Operation Safed Sagar was the Indian Air Force's air campaign during the war, targeting Pakistani positions in high-altitude areas.  Operation Talwar was the Indian Navy's operation to blockade Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea. Operation Vijay was the overall Indian Army operation to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Kargil district. Finally, the Kargil Review Committee was established in the aftermath of the war to analyze its shortcomings and suggest improvements to India's defense strategy. Therefore, all four are integral to the Kargil War context. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more crucial components of the Kargil conflict's response and analysis.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the weaponization and militarization of space:**

1. Weaponization involves deploying weapons in space to target objects in orbit or on Earth.
2. Militarization involves using space to support ground, sea, and air-based military operations without deploying weapons.
3. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty aims to ban all forms of military activity in space.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately defines weaponization of space – the active deployment of weapons systems in the space domain for offensive or defensive purposes. Statement 2 correctly describes militarization, focusing on the utilization of space for military support without necessarily deploying weapons directly into space.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on celestial bodies, or in outer space, it does not encompass a complete ban on all military activities in space.  The treaty's interpretation and implementation remain a subject of ongoing debate and differing national interpretations. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following regarding the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF):**

1. It was established in 1994.
2. India joined the ARF in 1996.
3. It is a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues among ASEAN member states and their partners.
4. The ARF comprises only ASEAN member states.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).  It was indeed established in 1994, India joined in 1996, and its primary function is to facilitate dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues within the ASEAN region and with its dialogue partners.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the ARF's membership includes ASEAN member states and their dialogue partners, making it a broader multilateral forum.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate representations of the ARF.


**4. Consider the following statements concerning the East Asia Summit (EAS):**

1. The EAS was established in 2005 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
2. It is a leaders-led forum focusing primarily on economic issues.
3. The EAS includes all ASEAN member states plus several other countries from the Asia-Pacific region.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the EAS was established in 2005 in Kuala Lumpur. Statement 3 is also correct;  the EAS membership comprises ASEAN member states plus other Asia-Pacific nations.  However, statement 2 is inaccurate. While the EAS does address economic matters, its scope is broader, encompassing strategic, political, and economic discussions at the leader level.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are entirely accurate.



**5. Consider the following about the TAPI gas pipeline project:**

1. The pipeline originates in the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan.
2.  The pipeline's route spans approximately 1,800 km.
3. The pipeline's primary purpose is to transport oil from Turkmenistan to India.
4. The Galkynysh gas field is one of the world's five largest gas fields.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the TAPI gas pipeline project. The pipeline does originate in the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan, spans approximately 1,800 km, and the Galkynysh field is indeed among the world's five largest gas fields. However, statement 3 is incorrect; TAPI is designed to transport *natural gas*, not oil.  Therefore, only three of the statements are correct.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Colombo Process:**

1.  The Colombo Process focuses primarily on counter-terrorism strategies.
2.  India recently chaired a meeting of the Colombo Process.
3.  The Colombo Process is a regional security initiative focused solely on South Asia.
4. The Colombo Process involves collaboration among multiple countries on migration issues.

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: India did recently chair a meeting of the Colombo Process. Statement 4 is also correct: The Colombo Process deals with managing migration issues through regional cooperation.  Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. The Colombo Process has a broader mandate than just counter-terrorism and it's not limited to South Asia; it involves regional cooperation on various issues, including migration. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding the World Press Freedom Index (WPFI):**

1. The WPFI is published annually by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).
2. The WPFI ranks countries based solely on the number of journalists imprisoned.
3. The WPFI 2024 included a theme related to environmental journalism.

Which statement(s) is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct: Reporters Without Borders (RSF) publishes the WPFI annually.  Statement 3 is also correct: The WPFI 2024 did indeed have a theme related to environmental journalism. Statement 2 is incorrect; the WPFI considers a broader range of factors affecting press freedom than just the number of imprisoned journalists. It assesses the overall environment for press freedom, including legal frameworks, political pressures, and violence against journalists. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):**

1. The AIIB’s primary focus is on providing financial assistance to high-income countries.
2. The AIIB is a multilateral development bank.
3. The AIIB’s mandate includes supporting infrastructure development projects.

Which of the statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The AIIB prioritizes providing financial assistance to *low-income* and developing countries for infrastructure projects. Statement 2 is correct; the AIIB is a multilateral development bank. Statement 3 is also correct: The AIIB's core purpose is to fund and support infrastructure development projects in its member countries.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Arab League:**

1.  The Arab League is an intergovernmental organization.
2.  The Arab League's primary focus is on promoting economic cooperation among its member states.
3.  The Arab League's membership is limited to countries in North Africa.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 are correct. Operation Sadbhav focuses on providing humanitarian assistance to Southeast Asian nations, while Operation Sadbhavana is a domestic initiative. Statement 3 is incorrect; Tiger Triumph 2024 is a bilateral exercise between India and the *United States*, not the United Kingdom.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while India is a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping, the provided text doesn't explicitly state frequent participation in large-scale multilateral UN-organized HADR exercises.  Therefore, only two statements accurately portray India's involvement in HADR operations.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of the Kargil War and its aftermath?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and are correct. Operation Vijay was indeed the overarching military operation to reclaim Indian territory. Operation Talwar successfully blockaded the Pakistani Navy. The Kargil Review Committee was established to analyze the war's shortcomings. However, statement 2 is incorrect.  Operation Safed Sagar targeted Pakistani troops in *high-altitude* positions, not low-altitude ones.  The chairman of the KRC was K. Subrahmanyam, not A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.  Therefore, only three of the statements accurately reflect the Kargil War and its aftermath.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe elements of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

UNTOC (Palermo Convention) is a core international treaty against transnational organized crime, ratified by India.  The SAARC Convention specifically addresses trafficking in women and children, a significant aspect of TOC. SAWEN targets wildlife crime, often linked to transnational criminal networks.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  The Commonwealth operates on a principle of consensus, where all members are considered equal, and they collectively choose the Head of the Commonwealth. New Delhi indeed hosted both the 1983 CHOGM and the 2010 Commonwealth Games.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window was established under the India-UN Development Fund, not solely funded by the UK.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect key facts about BIMSTEC. The charter coming into force gave it legal personality, the transport connectivity plan is a significant project, and non-interference is a core principle.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while Nepal's ratification was important, it wasn't the final one.  This question tests knowledge of a regional cooperation organization, focusing on its structure, principles, and major initiatives.  The distractor in option 2 plays on the importance of Nepal's role but is factually incorrect. The question assesses understanding of regional cooperation mechanisms and their operational aspects.

(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The tripartite agreement was signed in 2016, and the port is strategically located to provide an alternative route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Chabahar Port is located on the Gulf of Oman, not the Arabian Sea. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the development is not primarily funded by the United States. This question tests knowledge of a crucial geostrategic project, emphasizing its location and significance in regional connectivity.  The distractors involve subtle geographical inaccuracies and incorrect funding sources.  The question assesses understanding of geopolitical strategies and regional infrastructure developments.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on international relations and economics, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with Malaysia:**

1. Malaysia is among India's top three largest diaspora populations globally.
2.  India and Malaysia are working to integrate UPI payment systems.
3. The Malaysia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA) focuses solely on trade liberalization.

How many of the above statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text explicitly states that Malaysia has the third-largest Indian diaspora after the US and UAE.

Statement 2 is also correct. The passage mentions India's initiatives to deepen economic partnership with Malaysia, including accepting UPI payments. This indicates a move towards greater financial integration.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While MICECA aims to boost economic ties, it's not limited to just trade liberalization.  A comprehensive economic cooperation agreement typically encompasses a broader range of areas, such as investment, services, and possibly even technological collaboration.  The focus is on a wider economic partnership, not solely on trade.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Chabahar Port:**

1. The Chabahar Port's development is a solely bilateral agreement between India and Iran.
2. The port significantly reduces the distance between India's west coast and landlocked Central Asian countries.
3. The Chabahar Port project is unrelated to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).

How many of the statements above are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The text clearly states that a tripartite agreement involving India, Iran, and Afghanistan was signed in 2016 for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port.  This highlights a multilateral, not solely bilateral, dimension.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage emphasizes the port's role in minimizing the distance from India's west coast to landlocked Afghanistan and other Central Asian nations, offering a significant logistical advantage.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text explicitly links Chabahar Port to the INSTC initiative, describing it as a gateway to Central Asia and an alternative route to the Suez Canal.  The two are directly related in terms of regional connectivity.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1.  The INSTC was established in 2000 with the participation of India, Iran, and Russia.
2. The INSTC primarily aims to enhance maritime connectivity between India and Europe.
3. The INSTC avoids the use of the Suez Canal route.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transportation network established in 2000 through an agreement signed by India, Iran, and Russia.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INSTC connects India to Europe, it's not solely focused on maritime connectivity.  It's a multi-modal corridor, utilizing various transportation methods including rail and road, in addition to sea routes.  The emphasis is on a diverse and integrated transportation system.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INSTC offers an alternative to the Suez Canal, implying it can be used to avoid it in certain circumstances, it does not inherently avoid the Suez Canal route. The INSTC is designed to provide an alternative, not to exclude the Suez Canal altogether.


**4. Consider the following international organizations:**

1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
3.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)

Which of these organizations focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 3
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF (Financial Action Task Force) is explicitly mentioned in the text as an organization that assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Its primary focus is on financial crime.

The INCB (International Narcotics Control Board) deals with drug control and illicit trafficking. While financial flows can be involved in drug trafficking, the INCB’s mandate is not primarily focused on money laundering or terrorist financing in the broader sense.

The CCPCJ (Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice) addresses a wider range of criminal justice issues, including transnational organized crime.  While money laundering and terrorist financing might fall under its purview, it's not its singular or primary focus.  The CCPCJ has a broader mandate than just financial crimes.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's relations with its neighbors:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports natural gas.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electricity corridor between Katihar and Bornagar is an India-Bangladesh initiative, not a joint project with Nepal.  The text clearly specifies the countries involved in this particular energy cooperation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan.  The text explicitly mentions these projects in the context of India-Nepal energy cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydroelectric projects are located in Bhutan, not Nepal.  The text clearly associates these projects with India-Bhutan relations and hydropower development in Bhutan.  The projects are explicitly mentioned as being in Bhutan.



**7. Consider the following regarding India-Bhutan relations:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was initially signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007.
2. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, and Bhutan has a trade surplus with India.
3.  The Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) is permanently stationed in eastern Bhutan.

How many of the statements above are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms that the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation was signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007, highlighting the enduring nature of this bilateral agreement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, the text specifies that the balance of trade is in India's favor, meaning India has a trade surplus, not Bhutan.  This points to an important aspect of the economic relationship, often overlooked.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the IMTRAT is permanently based in *western* Bhutan, not eastern Bhutan.  This seemingly minor detail is crucial for understanding the geographical deployment of Indian military personnel in Bhutan.  The location of IMTRAT is a key strategic consideration.


**8. Consider the following geographical locations:**

1. Lake Turkana
2. Mount Kilimanjaro
3. Lipulekh Pass

Which of the above is located in Africa?

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text clearly states that the border between India and China is not formally demarcated and there is no mutually agreed LAC.  The LAC is a de facto boundary, subject to ongoing disputes and disagreements.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage mentions the Galwan incident of 2020 as the deadliest since 1962, highlighting a significant escalation in border tensions.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, illustrating a significant territorial dispute.


**10. Consider the following statements related to the Commonwealth:**

1. The Commonwealth is an organization where decisions are made by majority vote.
2.  Barbados was the last country to remove the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text explicitly states that decisions within the Commonwealth are made by consensus, not by majority vote.  This reflects the organization's emphasis on inclusivity and equal participation among its members.

Statement 2 is correct. The text confirms that Barbados removed the UK monarch as its head of state in 2021, marking a significant shift in its relationship with the Commonwealth.

Statement 3 is correct. The text mentions the CLGF's participation in a meeting on "Reinforcing Social Resilience through Women’s Political Representation," directly linking its activities to gender equality and local governance.  This aligns with SDG 5.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and related aspects of India's bilateral relations.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's bilateral trade relations:**

1. India enjoys a trade surplus with Nepal.
2.  India is the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in Bhutan.
3. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
4. China is India's largest trading partner in goods, resulting in a significant trade deficit for India.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. India does have a trade surplus with Nepal, meaning it exports more to Nepal than it imports.  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  China is currently India's largest trading partner in goods, but this relationship results in a significant trade deficit for India (India imports substantially more from China than it exports). Statement 2 is incorrect; while India is a major investor in Bhutan, the text does not definitively state it's the *largest* source of FDI.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between slightly different claims. The distractors (incorrect options) are designed to be plausible given the overall context of India's trade relations.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's energy cooperation with its neighbours:**

1. The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline is South Asia's first cross-border petroleum products pipeline.
2. India has constructed four major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, supplying electricity to India.  These include the Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects.
3. Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.
4. The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) is a joint India-Nepal initiative.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's energy collaborations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline is accurately described.  The four hydroelectric projects in Bhutan are correctly listed, and the trilateral energy pact between Nepal, India, and Bangladesh is mentioned in the text.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the electricity corridor mentioned is a India-Bangladesh initiative, not a joint project with Nepal. This question tests factual recall and requires careful attention to detail regarding specific projects and agreements. The distractors are carefully chosen to represent plausible but incorrect connections between nations and energy projects.


**3. Consider the following features of India's relationships with its neighbours:**

1. The 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship forms the basis of India-Nepal relations.
2. India and Bhutan's relationship is governed by the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, renewed in 2007.
3.  The Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal (BBIN) initiative has been fully endorsed by all four participating nations.
4.  India and Bangladesh conduct joint military exercises such as Sampriti and Milan.

Which of the above statements are accurate representations of the diplomatic and security dimensions of India's neighborhood policy?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. The treaties mentioned correctly define the core of the bilateral relationships.  The joint military exercises between India and Bangladesh are also accurately described.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the text explicitly states that Nepal has *not* fully endorsed the BBIN initiative due to environmental concerns. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the nuances of regional cooperation initiatives.  The inclusion of the BBIN detail acts as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to identify exceptions to broader trends.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the India-China border dispute:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border between India and China.
2.  India considers the Johnson Line (1865) as the border in the Western Sector (Ladakh), while China claims the McDonald Line (1899).
3. The Middle Sector (Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand) is largely undisputed.
4.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the complexities of the India-China border?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  The differing interpretations of the border lines in Ladakh are accurately described. The largely undisputed nature of the Middle Sector is also correct. China's claim on Arunachal Pradesh is a well-known aspect of the dispute. Statement 1 is incorrect; the LAC is *not* formally demarcated. This question tests factual knowledge of the historical and geographical dimensions of a significant geopolitical issue.  The distractor is designed to challenge the candidate's understanding of the precise definition of the LAC.


**5. Consider the following regarding the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km multi-modal transport network.
2. It connects India, Iran, and Russia.
3.  It includes a sea route that bypasses the Suez Canal.
4. The Chabahar Port is a key component of the INSTC, offering an alternative route to landlocked Central Asian countries.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the INSTC?

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the INSTC. The length, the participating countries, the alternative route to the Suez Canal, and the role of Chabahar Port are all correctly described in the text.  This question combines factual recall with an understanding of the strategic significance of the INSTC.  The question's difficulty arises from its comprehensive nature; candidates need to correctly identify all four components to arrive at the correct answer.  No distractors are included as all statements are true.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's approach to combating money laundering and related financial crimes?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all accurate descriptions of India's measures to combat money laundering. The PMLA is the primary legislation, the ED is a key enforcement agency, the FIU-IND is responsible for financial intelligence, and the MLAT portal enhances international collaboration. Statement 5 is also correct; the MER does assess measures against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, as this is a critical aspect of combating terrorist financing.  Therefore, four out of the five statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following international organizations and their initiatives:**

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) operates the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) to monitor illicit nuclear trafficking.

How many of the above statements correctly identify the organization and its key initiative or activity?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the organizations and their activities. The IAEA's ITDB tracks nuclear material theft, the UNODC's report highlights drug abuse trends, the ITU's GCI assesses cybersecurity, and the FATF conducts peer reviews. However, statement 5 is incorrect. While the ISA promotes solar energy, its scope extends beyond only developing countries.  It focuses on global cooperation and technology transfer.

How many of the statements above correctly describe aspects of India's international partnerships and engagements?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of India's international collaborations.  The India-Singapore partnership is strong, encompassing trade and strategic ties.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all correct. The IPEF did create a Crisis Response Network, Belarus joined the SCO, IMEC focuses on connectivity, and BRICS Pay offers an alternative to SWIFT.  Statement 5 is incorrect; the ASEAN Future Forum is intended to be a platform for sharing new ideas and policy recommendations, not specifically for dialogue on political and security issues, although those may be included.  Therefore, four statements are correct.


**5. Consider the following international conventions and treaties:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons.

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, India is only the second biggest for Bangladesh in Asia. Statement 2 is incorrect; 'SAMPRITI' and 'MILAN' are joint military exercises between India and Bangladesh. Statement 3 is incorrect; PIWTT facilitates trade between India and Bangladesh.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Each question is designed to be challenging and incorporates plausible distractors.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1956.
3. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a crucial role in enforcement.
4. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is a cornerstone of India's anti-money laundering efforts.  Statement 3 is also correct; the ED is a vital agency in enforcing these laws. Statement 4 is accurate; the MLAT portal enhances international collaboration in combating financial crime. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956. The ED's establishment date (1956) is a distractor, designed to confuse candidates familiar with the ED's role but not its precise timeline relative to the FIU-IND.  The incorrect date for the FIU-IND, coupled with the inclusion of the accurately described roles of the other agencies, makes this a challenging question testing factual recall and analytical skills.


**2. Consider the following regarding the regions identified in the UNODC's World Drug Day report as significantly affected by drug abuse:**

1. The Golden Triangle, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is now referred to as the Death Triangle.
2. The Golden Crescent, encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, is now termed the Death Crescent.
3. The Triple Frontier Area, involving Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, remains a significant concern.
4.  Cannabis is identified as the least abused drug globally.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one  (b) Only two  (c) Only three  (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect the UNODC report's findings on regions heavily impacted by drug abuse and the renaming of the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent. The report highlights these areas' continued significance in the global drug trade.  Statement 4, however, is incorrect. The report explicitly states that cannabis is the *most* abused drug globally, making it a strong distractor. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies within seemingly similar statements.


**3. Consider the following statements about the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2009.
2.  The agreement aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India.
3. India currently enjoys a significant trade surplus with ASEAN nations under AITIGA.
4. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting recently reviewed the agreement's effectiveness in Jakarta.

Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 (b) 1 and 2 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of AITIGA's details and recent developments.  Statement 3, however, is incorrect. The text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, making it a significant distractor. The inclusion of this seemingly plausible but false statement raises the difficulty level, requiring precise knowledge of the trade balance between India and ASEAN.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related but contrasting economic facts.


**4. Consider the following regarding the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC):**

1.  SAARC decisions are made on the basis of consensus.
2.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement was established in 2007.
3.  Bilateral and contentious issues are typically included in SAARC deliberations.
4. The RBI recently announced a SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 are correct. SAARC operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, and the RBI's recent announcement regarding the currency swap framework is accurate.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; SAFTA was established in 2006, not 2007.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the text explicitly states that bilateral and contentious issues are *excluded* from SAARC deliberations. The close proximity of the correct and incorrect years (2006 and 2007) for SAFTA, combined with the inclusion of a seemingly plausible but opposite statement regarding contentious issues, creates a challenging question that tests both factual recall and analytical skills.


**5. Consider the following statements about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  The IMEC is intended to be a cornerstone of global connectivity.
2.  The IMEC was officially launched at the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave.
3.  The IMEC primarily focuses on enhancing trade relations between India and the Middle East.
4.  The IMEC's primary goal is to improve energy security in Europe.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is definitively correct, based on the provided text. While the IMEC is expected to improve connectivity, the text does not explicitly state that it was *officially launched* at the mentioned conclave (making statement 2 incorrect).  Statements 3 and 4 represent plausible but unsupported interpretations of the IMEC's potential impact; the text does not specify its precise focus on trade with the Middle East or energy security in Europe. This question tests the ability to distinguish between explicitly stated information and implied or inferred conclusions, enhancing its difficulty level.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):**

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO as its tenth member.
2. The SCO’s 24th summit was held in Astana, Kazakhstan.
3.  The SCO primarily focuses on economic cooperation among South Asian nations.
4. India is the current chair of the SCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct; Belarus's accession and the summit location are accurately reflected in the text.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. The SCO's focus is not limited to South Asia; it encompasses a broader regional scope.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the text doesn't specify the current SCO chair.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between accurate and inaccurate generalizations about the SCO's membership and activities.


**7. Consider the following statements about the Group of Seven (G7):**

1. India participated in the 50th G7 Summit as an Outreach Country.
2. The G7 has a permanent, fixed structure to manage its activities.
3. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative.
4. The G7 Summit in 2024 was held in Apulia, Italy.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4 (b) 1 and 3 only (c) 2 and 4 only (d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are all correct. India's participation, the PGII as a G7 initiative, and the summit location are accurately stated in the text.  Statement 2, however, is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its presidency rotates annually, setting the agenda for each year. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify incorrect statements about the organization's structure and activities.



**8. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  An upcoming electricity corridor connects Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam).
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are examples of India-Nepal energy cooperation.
3.  The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects are examples of India-Bangladesh energy cooperation.
4. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports natural gas between India and Nepal.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The electricity corridor, the India-Nepal hydropower projects, and the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline are accurately described. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects are examples of energy cooperation between *India and Bhutan*, not India and Bangladesh. This question tests factual recall concerning specific energy projects and their geographic locations. The inclusion of seemingly similar but geographically incorrect information makes this a challenging question.


**9. Consider the following regarding India's relations with Bangladesh:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh conduct military exercises like Sampriti and Milan.
3.  Bangladesh has joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.
4.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Sri Lanka.


Which of the statements given above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 (b) 1 and 2 only (c) 2 and 3 only (d) 1, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of India-Bangladesh relations.  Statement 4, however, is incorrect. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between *India and Bangladesh*, not India and Sri Lanka. This seemingly minor inaccuracy, combined with the accurate statements, makes this a difficult question testing the candidate's precise knowledge of bilateral projects and their geographical locations.


**10. Consider the following about the  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1. Jagjit Pavadia from India has been re-elected to the INCB for a third term.
2.  The INCB is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
3. The INCB's primary focus is on combating illicit arms trafficking.
4. The INCB's term of office is for a period of 10 years.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one (b) Only two (c) Only three (d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  The re-election of Jagjit Pavadia is stated in the text.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are incorrect.  While the INCB is involved in international drug control, it is *not* a UN specialized agency.  Its primary focus is on international drug control, not arms trafficking.  The term of office is not 10 years. This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between correct information and plausible but incorrect statements about an international organization.  The inclusion of misleading information about the INCB's status, mandate, and term of office significantly increases the question's difficulty.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level is aimed at 'difficult' by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding international efforts to combat transnational organized crime:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption.
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) acts as the secretariat for UNTOC and spearheads initiatives like TOCTA and GFP.
3. SAWEN, established in 2011, is a regional initiative focusing on wildlife crime, with India as a member.
4. The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, adopted in 2002, is a significant regional framework.
5. The GlobE network, a global operational network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities, has India as a member of its steering committee.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the international mechanisms to tackle transnational organized crime?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All five statements are factually correct and accurately describe various international mechanisms and initiatives aimed at combating transnational organized crime.  The Palermo Convention is indeed supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, strengthening the legal framework against such crimes.  The UNODC plays a crucial role as the secretariat for UNTOC and leads important initiatives. SAWEN is a vital regional partnership focused on wildlife crime, a significant aspect of transnational organized crime. The SAARC convention specifically targets human trafficking, a major concern. Finally, India's election to the GlobE steering committee highlights its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network:**

1. GlobE is a UN-led initiative.
2.  GlobE's primary focus is on combating money laundering.
3.  India's participation in GlobE is limited to observer status.
4.  GlobE facilitates information sharing among member nations.
5.  GlobE's activities are primarily confined to South Asia.


Which of the above statements is/are NOT correct regarding the GlobE network?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; GlobE is not explicitly stated as a UN-led initiative in the provided text.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while anti-corruption is a core focus, money laundering is not explicitly its *primary* focus. GlobE's mandate is broader than just money laundering. Statement 3 is incorrect; India has been elected to the steering committee, indicating a more active role than mere observer status. Statement 5 is incorrect; the GlobE network is global in scope, not limited to South Asia. Therefore, statements 2, 3, and 5 are not correct.


**3. Consider the following regarding India's international collaborations:**

1. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
2. The India-UN Development Fund includes a Commonwealth Sub-Window.
3. India's participation in the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) focuses primarily on economic development.
4. India's relationship with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is primarily focused on military cooperation.
5. India's engagement with the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) includes participation in counter-terrorism initiatives.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's international partnerships?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 5 are all factually correct. India is indeed a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention. The existence of a Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund is mentioned.  India's participation in SCO counter-terrorism efforts is also noted. Statement 3 is incorrect; while economic development is relevant, the CLGF's focus on women's political representation is highlighted in the given text.  Statement 4 is incorrect;  while military cooperation might exist, the text emphasizes the political aspect of India-GCC relations.  Therefore, four statements (1, 2, 5, and potentially 3 depending on interpretation of 'primarily') are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Commonwealth:**

1. The Commonwealth is primarily an economic organization.
2.  Decisions within the Commonwealth are made through majority voting.
3.  King Charles III is the head of state in all Commonwealth countries.
4.  The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) focuses on promoting gender equality in local governance.
5.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010.


Which of the above statements are NOT accurate representations of the Commonwealth and its associated entities?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 5
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect; the Commonwealth encompasses political and social aspects, not solely economic ones. Statement 2 is incorrect; decisions are made by consensus, not majority voting. Statement 3 is incorrect; King Charles is head of state only in 14 Commonwealth countries (realms), not all. Statement 5 is correct; India did host the 2010 Commonwealth Games.  Therefore, statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 are inaccurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the India-US relationship:**

1. The India-US Trade Policy Forum was established in 2005.
2.  India has a trade deficit with the United States.

Which of the above statements regarding the India-US relationship is/are INCORRECT?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is correct; the Trade Policy Forum was indeed established in 2005. Statement 2 is incorrect; India has a *trade surplus*, not a deficit, with the US. Statement 3 is incorrect; LEMOA was signed in 2016, but the text states it was in 2016. Statement 4 is incorrect; CAATSA *does* pose a potential threat to the relationship, as demonstrated by the State Department's warnings. Statement 5 is correct; the Malabar exercises involve the four nations mentioned.  Thus, statements 2 and 4 are incorrect.


These MCQs demand a high level of factual recall and understanding of the interrelationships between various international organizations and India's role within them.  The distractors are carefully designed to test the candidates' comprehension and ability to differentiate between closely related facts.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that the difficulty level is inherently subjective; these questions aim for a high difficulty level by incorporating subtle distractors and requiring precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1990.
3. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a significant role in enforcement.
4. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is indeed a cornerstone of India's anti-money laundering efforts.  Statement 3 is also correct; the Directorate of Enforcement plays a crucial role in investigating and prosecuting money laundering cases. Statement 4 is accurate; the MLAT portal enhances international collaboration in combating money laundering. However, Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1990.  This slight inaccuracy in the year serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies among closely related facts.


**2. Consider the following regarding the UNODC's World Drug Day Report:**

1.  Cannabis is the most abused drug globally.
2.  The "Golden Triangle" region, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is highlighted as a major drug production area.  It has been renamed the "Death Triangle."
3.  The "Golden Crescent," now termed the "Death Crescent," includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran.
4.  Uruguay has legalized the recreational use of cannabis.

Which of the above statements are NOT accurate according to the report's findings?

(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the statements accurately reflect information from the UNODC's World Drug Day Report. The report indeed highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug, the renaming of the Golden Triangle and Crescent regions, and Uruguay's legalization of cannabis. The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information amidst potentially confusing terminology (the renaming of regions). The inclusion of all correct statements as options increases the difficulty by eliminating the easy path of identifying obviously incorrect statements.


**3. Consider the following concerning the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:**

1. It grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) comprehensive disciplinary and administrative authority.
2. An ISO is defined as a body of troops exclusively comprising personnel subject to the Army Act, 1950.
3. The Act applies to personnel serving in or attached to ISOs.
4. The Act aims to streamline the command structure within the Indian armed forces but does not impact the existing legal frameworks governing individual service branches.

How many of the above statements are entirely accurate representations of the Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct descriptions of the Act's provisions.  Statement 4 is also largely correct, focusing on the Act's aim without contradicting its core functions. However, Statement 2 is inaccurate. The definition of an ISO within the Act includes personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957, or any combination thereof – not exclusively the Army Act. This subtle distinction between "exclusively" and "including" creates a challenging distractor. The question assesses the ability to carefully analyze legal provisions and identify nuanced inaccuracies within a legal framework.


**4. Consider the following international organizations and their key characteristics:**

1.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts peer reviews of countries' anti-money laundering measures.
2.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) recently admitted Belarus as its tenth member.
3.  The Group of Seven (G7) operates with a permanent secretariat based in Brussels.
4.  The Commonwealth is headed by a rotating presidency elected from among its member states.


Which of the above statements concerning these organizations are entirely correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the roles of the FATF and the SCO's recent expansion.  Statement 4 is also correct regarding the Commonwealth's leadership structure. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. The G7 does not have a permanent secretariat; its presidency rotates annually among member states. This question tests factual recall and understanding of the organizational structures of various international bodies.  The near-correctness of Statement 3, combined with the accurate information in the other statements, creates a high difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's relationship with international agreements:**

1. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
2. India has ratified the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention.
3. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
4. India is a party to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.


How many of the statements above correctly describe India's participation in relevant international agreements?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are all accurate. India is indeed a signatory to the CWC, a party to the UNTOC (Palermo Convention), and a member of SAWEN. However, the phrasing of statement 4 is subtly misleading.  While India is a strong advocate for the goals of the Biological Weapons Convention,  it's important to note the subtle difference between being a "party" and having formally ratified it.  The question's difficulty stems from this subtle distinction, requiring precise knowledge of India's participation in international agreements, testing both factual recall and nuanced understanding of international relations.


1. Consider the following:

1.  The Arab League Summit 2024 was held in Bahrain.
2.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is tasked with assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources.

4.  The Nord Stream pipelines supply natural gas from Russia to northern Germany.
5.  The Kursk region borders Ukraine and includes the basins of the Dnieper and Don rivers.
6.  The Chagos Islands are located south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean.


How many of the above statements accurately describe recent geopolitical events or entities?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately reflect recent geopolitical events or entities.  The 2024 Arab League Summit's location in Bahrain is a matter of public record. The AIIB's mandate includes assisting low-income countries, as confirmed by statements from the Union Finance Minister. The contested status of Nagorno-Karabakh, its dual names (Artsakh and Nagorno-Karabakh), and its official recognition as part of Azerbaijan are well-documented facts. The Nord Stream pipelines' function and location are widely known. The Kursk region's location relative to Ukraine and its inclusion of the Dnieper and Don river basins are accurate geographical details. Finally, the location of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean, south of the Maldives, is a verifiable geographical fact.  Therefore, all six statements are correct.


2. Consider the following:

1.  The East Asia Summit includes ASEAN members plus Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US.
2.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
3.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) operates on a principle of unanimity in decision-making.

5.  The Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) recently included Bangladesh as its fifth member.
6.  The World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) 2024 was released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF).

How many of the above statements correctly describe regional cooperation frameworks or indices?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All six statements accurately describe the functions or objectives of the mentioned international organizations.  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is indeed a currency swap arrangement. The Arab Maghreb Union's focus on cooperation among North African countries is accurate. The IMF's role in global economic policy is well-known. The OECD focuses on economic development and related issues. The WTO's mandate includes international trade regulations.

**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.
2.  Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia, a country bordering the Indian Ocean.
3.  Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the UAE, but is currently held by Iran.
4.  The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are located in the East China Sea.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the geopolitical locations and disputes mentioned in the provided text?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately represent information found in the provided text.  The Gulf of Aden's location as a crucial waterway connecting the Red Sea and Arabian Sea is explicitly stated. The text clearly identifies Mogadishu as Somalia's capital and its location on the Horn of Africa bordering the Indian Ocean. The territorial dispute over Abu Musa Island between Iran and the UAE, with Iran's current control, is also detailed. Finally, the text mentions the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) and their position in the East China Sea.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading details within these statements regarding the geographic locations and associated conflicts.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Patani conflict involves the Thai government and Malay-Muslim separatists.
2.  The West Papua conflict features the Indonesian government and the Free Papua Movement (OPM).
3.  The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict involves Azerbaijan and Armenian separatists, with Russian peacekeepers previously involved.
4.  The conflict in the Kursk region of Russia involves armed militants and the Russian government.

How many of these conflicts involve a central government and a separatist or insurgent group?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the mentioned conflicts clearly involve a central government facing a separatist or insurgent group. The Patani conflict pits the Thai government against Malay-Muslim separatists.  The West Papua conflict involves Indonesia's government against the OPM independence movement. The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict features Azerbaijan's government against Armenian separatists, although the role of Russian peacekeepers adds a layer of complexity. The Kursk region situation, however, describes armed militants launching attacks within Russia, but doesn't specify a clearly defined separatist movement with formal demands for independence or autonomy, making the conflict's nature distinct from the other three. Therefore, only three conflicts directly fit the description.


**3. Consider the following statements about geographically significant locations:**

1.  Lake Turkana, the largest permanent desert lake globally, is primarily fed by the Nile River.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa’s highest peak, is a stratovolcano located in Kenya.
3.  The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan, facilitating Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.
4.  The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, serving as a crucial maritime route between Asia and Europe.


How many of the above statements contain factual inaccuracies regarding the geographic features or their locations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Two statements contain factual inaccuracies.  Firstly, Lake Turkana is indeed Africa's largest permanent desert lake but is primarily fed by the Omo River, not the Nile River. Secondly, Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya.  The other two statements are correct: The Lipulekh Pass is accurately described as being close to the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal (not Bhutan), and the Suez Canal's function and location are correctly stated.  Therefore, only two statements present factual errors concerning the geographic features involved.


**4. Consider the following regarding international organizations and initiatives:**

1.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is primarily focused on providing financial assistance to high-income countries.
2.  The Arab League Summit of 2024 was held in Egypt.
3.  The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) aims to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.
4.  The Colombo Process primarily focuses on counter-terrorism efforts in South Asia.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the stated organizations and their primary functions or objectives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately reflect the organizations and their functions. Statement 3 regarding the INSTC's objective of connecting India, Russia, and Europe through Iran and Central Asia is correct.  Statement 4 is also correct; the Colombo Process does indeed focus on regional cooperation, particularly on migration management issues. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the AIIB focuses on assisting low and middle-income countries, not high-income ones. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Egypt. Therefore, only two statements correctly portray the organizations' functions and objectives.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning conflicts and geopolitical areas:**

1.  The Chechen conflict involves Chechen separatists seeking independence from Russia.
2.  The conflict in South Ossetia and Abkhazia is primarily between Georgia and Russia-backed separatists.

4.  The Kurdish-Turkish conflict is primarily focused on the control of the Red Sea.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the primary actors and nature of the stated conflicts?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately reflect the primary actors and nature of the conflicts. Statement 1 correctly identifies the Chechen conflict as involving Chechen separatists aiming for independence from Russia. Statement 2 is also accurate in outlining the conflict between Georgia and Russia-backed separatists in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. However, statement 3 is inaccurate; while sectarian tensions play a role, the Yemen civil war is a complex conflict involving multiple factions and political power struggles, not simply a Sunni-Shia conflict. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Kurdish-Turkish conflict does not center on control of the Red Sea, instead focusing on Kurdish autonomy demands within Turkey and related security concerns. Therefore, only two statements correctly characterize the primary elements of the conflicts.


**6. Consider the following regarding India's foreign relations and initiatives:**

1.  The first regional office of Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) was inaugurated in Singapore in 2023.
2.  Malaysia is among India's top three largest diaspora populations.

How many of the statements accurately reflect India's recent diplomatic activities, economic partnerships, or infrastructure projects?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three out of the four statements accurately represent India's recent foreign relations and initiatives. Statement 2 is accurate, as Malaysia is indeed among India's top three largest diaspora populations. Statement 3 is also correct; India and Malaysia do have a MICECA in place for strengthening economic ties. The Chabahar Port project, however, involves India and Iran, but not Pakistan; Pakistan is bypassed in the project's design.  The location of HAL's first regional office is also inaccurate; it was inaugurated in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, not Singapore. Therefore, only three statements correctly reflect the details of India's foreign relations and initiatives.


**7. Consider the following regarding energy infrastructure and pipelines:**

1.  The TAPI pipeline transports natural gas from Turkmenistan to India, bypassing Afghanistan and Pakistan.
2.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Nepal.

(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the statements accurately describe the energy infrastructure projects and their characteristics. Statement 2 is correct; the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline does connect India and Nepal. Statement 4 is also accurate, correctly identifying Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu as hydroelectric projects located in Bhutan.  Statement 3 is also correct in that the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline does transport petroleum products. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the TAPI pipeline does not bypass Afghanistan and Pakistan; it passes through them, connecting Turkmenistan to India. Thus, only three statements are entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning India's relations with Maldives and other initiatives:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in Maldives was primarily driven by pro-China sentiments.
2.  Operation Neer provided medical assistance to Maldives during a crisis.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the elements of India-Maldives relations or related initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately reflect aspects of India-Maldives relations and related initiatives. Statement 1 is correct; the "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was indeed fueled by pro-China sentiments. Statement 3 is also correct; India's Greater Male Connectivity Project is a large infrastructure undertaking in the Maldives. Statement 4 is correct: the 8-degree Channel does separate Minicoy (part of Lakshadweep) from the Maldives.  However, Statement 2 is inaccurate; Operation Neer provided water assistance during a crisis, not medical assistance.  Therefore, three statements are entirely accurate in describing the elements of India-Maldives relations.


**9. Consider the following about the Kargil War and its aftermath:**

1.  Operation Vijay was launched to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Siachen Glacier region.
2.  Operation Safed Sagar involved the Indian Air Force targeting Pakistani troops.
3.  The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
4.  Operation Talwar was a naval operation to blockade the Pakistani navy.

How many statements correctly describe aspects of the Kargil War or its subsequent reviews?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three statements accurately describe elements of the Kargil War and its aftermath. Statement 2 is correct; Operation Safed Sagar did involve the Indian Air Force targeting Pakistani positions. Statement 4 correctly describes Operation Talwar as a naval operation to blockade the Pakistani navy.  Statement 4 is also correct, identifying the key locations involved in the conflict. However, Statement 1 is incorrect; Operation Vijay was focused on the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, not the Siachen Glacier region. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Kargil Review Committee was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam, not A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.  Therefore, only three statements accurately depict aspects of the war and its review.


**10. Consider the following concerning weaponization of space and international regulations:**

1.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of all types of weapons in space.
2.  Russia supported the UNSC draft resolution on weapon-free outer space.
3.  The UNSC resolution focused solely on banning nuclear weapons in space.
4.  Chloropicrin is a chemical agent that can be used as a fumigant and a warfare agent.

How many statements accurately reflect the details of the UNSC resolution on weapon-free outer space, weaponization of space, or the use of chemical weapons?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately reflect the information provided. Statement 4 correctly identifies chloropicrin as both a fumigant and a potential warfare agent.  Statement 1 is partially correct; the 1967 Outer Space Treaty does address weapons in space, but its scope and interpretation remain subjects of ongoing debate. However, the other two statements are inaccurate. Russia vetoed the UNSC resolution, not supporting it, and the resolution aimed to address WMDs in space, not exclusively nuclear weapons.  Therefore, only two statements accurately reflect the information about the UNSC resolution, weaponization of space, and the use of chemical weapons.

4.  India has secured the right to operate this port.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding Sittwe Port?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Sittwe Port is indeed a deep-water port at the Kaladan River's estuary in Myanmar's Rakhine State, and India has secured operational rights.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the port improves trade for India's Northeast, its primary focus isn't on enhancing trade specifically between India and Bangladesh.  The port's strategic importance lies in facilitating trade routes for India to its Northeast and beyond, including Central Asia.


3. Consider the following geographical features:

1.  The longest river in France.
2.  The Seine River.
3.  A river flowing northwesterly through Paris.

How many of the above accurately describe the Seine River?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** While the Seine River flows northwesterly through Paris and empties into the English Channel at Le Havre (statements 3 and 4), it's not the longest river in France (statement 1). The Loire River holds that distinction. Statement 2 is correct as it directly names the Seine River. Therefore, three of the statements accurately describe the Seine.

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  The Lipulekh Pass is in Uttarakhand's Pithorgarh district, shortens the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, and is a major pass in the Kumaon region's Kali Valley. However, statement 1 is incorrect; the tri-junction involves India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.


7. Consider the following aspects of the Suez Canal:

1.  Connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.
2.  Located in Panama.
3.  The shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IPEF Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and Labor Rights Advisory Board are all directly aimed at strengthening supply chains, managing disruptions, and improving labor practices within the Indo-Pacific region. These are core components of economic cooperation and resilience.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is also focused on economic cooperation, aiming to improve global connectivity and trade. While the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has economic dimensions, its primary focus is broader, encompassing security, political cooperation, and counter-terrorism efforts. Therefore, only three of the listed initiatives primarily focus on enhancing economic cooperation and supply chain resilience.

**Explanation:**

The G7 PGII, while relevant to global infrastructure development, is not a direct trade or economic agreement *between* India and any specific partner.

Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the number of agreements involving India.

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct: India is a founding member of the NAM. Statement 4 is correct: India actively contributes to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund.

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Conventions are foundational to international humanitarian law. The IAEA works on nuclear safety and security. The ITU focuses on international telecommunication standards and security. SIPRI researches peace and conflict issues. CMF is a multinational naval coalition focused on maritime security.  Therefore, four of the listed entities are clearly involved in international efforts related to peace, security, or humanitarian concerns.  Options (a) and (b) underestimate the scope of involvement, while option (d) is incorrect as it includes all entities without considering their specific areas of focus.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The Brandt Report.

IPOI focuses on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.  Therefore, four of the listed items relate to either Global South development or Indo-Pacific cooperation.

India's relations with the GCC involve significant economic ties (largest trading partner) and energy security.  India's relations with ASEAN include extensive trade and investment partnerships.  India's relations with SAARC, despite dysfunction, represent a significant regional grouping.  India's relations with the Commonwealth involve significant political and cultural ties.  While India's relationship with NATO is not as extensive as the others, it has growing strategic significance.  Therefore, four of the listed relationships involve significant economic or strategic partnerships for India. Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the extent and importance of these relationships.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Geneva Conventions do protect various categories of victims of armed conflict, Protocol III did introduce the Red Crystal emblem, and the 1954 Hague Convention focuses on cultural property protection.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; the 1972 convention prohibits biological weapons, not chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention was signed in 1993. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


7. Consider the following statements about the BRICS grouping and its initiatives:

1. The New Development Bank (NDB), headquartered in Shanghai, China, funds infrastructure projects in BRICS and other emerging economies.
2. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payment challenges.
3. The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to create a fair and equitable trading system for agricultural products, particularly focusing on promoting exports from developed nations to BRICS countries.
4.  The BRICS Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation is a collaborative initiative to enhance space technology cooperation, with an emphasis on military applications.


How many of the above statements accurately describe BRICS initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The NDB does fund infrastructure projects, and the Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides liquidity support. However, statement 3 is inaccurate; the BRICS Grain Exchange aims to enhance food security within the BRICS community, not necessarily prioritizing exports from developed nations. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while it enhances space technology cooperation, it doesn't emphasize military applications.  The emphasis is on broader applications. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


8. Consider the following about Cannabis legalization and the UNODC's observations:

1. Cannabis is the most widely abused drug globally, according to the UNODC.
2.  Uruguay was one of the first countries to fully legalize cannabis for recreational use.
3. The UNODC's reports highlight the "Death Crescent" as a region with significant cannabis cultivation and trafficking.
4. Canada and 27 US jurisdictions have fully legalized cannabis for both recreational and medicinal use.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the global situation regarding cannabis legalization and UNODC observations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The UNODC does report cannabis as the most widely abused drug, Uruguay was a pioneer in cannabis legalization, and the "Death Crescent" is associated with significant cannabis production and trafficking.  However, statement 4 is partially incorrect; while Canada and 27 US jurisdictions have legalized cannabis, it's not always for both recreational and medicinal use simultaneously; some jurisdictions may have legalized it for medicinal purposes only.  Therefore, only three statements are fully accurate.


9. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international organizations:

1. India's Jagjit Pavadia has been re-elected to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) for a third term.
2. India is a member of the G4 nations advocating for reform of the UN Security Council.
3. India has been elected to the steering committee of the GlobE network.
4. India actively participates in the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC).


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's participation in various international organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are accurate.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB, India's membership in the G4, its election to the GlobE steering committee, and its active participation in BIMSTEC are all well-documented facts.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.


10. Consider the following regarding military exercises involving India:

1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise between India and the USA.
2.  SALVEX is a joint naval exercise between India and the USA.
3. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and France.
4. Exercise Varuna is a bilateral naval exercise between India and Russia, conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2024.


How many of the above statements correctly describe India's participation in joint military exercises?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Yudh Abhyas, SALVEX, and Shakti are indeed joint military exercises involving India, with the USA and France respectively.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; Exercise Varuna is a bilateral naval exercise between India and France, not Russia, and was conducted in the Mediterranean Sea in 2024.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.



1. Consider the following features of Lake Turkana:

1.  Located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
2.  Africa's fourth-largest lake.
3.  Largest permanent desert lake globally.
4.  Fed primarily by the Omo River.
5.  Known for its high fish potential.
6.  A UNESCO World Heritage Site.


How many of the above statements accurately describe Lake Turkana?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all accurate descriptions of Lake Turkana.  It is indeed situated in both northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, making it a transboundary lake. It holds the distinction of being Africa's fourth-largest lake and the world's largest permanent desert lake. Its primary water source is the Omo River, originating in Ethiopia.  The recent survey highlighting its high fish potential is also a fact.  However, statement 6 is incorrect; Lake Turkana is not currently a UNESCO World Heritage Site, although it's a significant candidate for consideration.  The other options are incorrect because they underestimate the number of accurate features described.  The question tests factual recall and analytical skills by requiring the candidate to assess the accuracy of each statement about Lake Turkana.



2. Consider the following regarding Mount Kilimanjaro:

1.  Located in Kenya.
2.  Highest peak in Africa.
3.  A stratovolcano composed of ash, lava, and rock.
4.  Part of a larger mountain range.
5.  Source of the Nile River.


How many of the above statements are correct about Mount Kilimanjaro?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements are correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa (2) and is a stratovolcano formed from layers of ash, lava, and rock (3).  However, statement 1 is incorrect; it's located in Tanzania, not Kenya. Statement 4 is also wrong; Kilimanjaro is a freestanding mountain, not part of a mountain range.  Finally, statement 5 is inaccurate; while Mount Kilimanjaro has glaciers, it is not the source of the Nile River.  The question assesses factual recall and requires the candidate to differentiate accurate from inaccurate information regarding the geographical features of Mount Kilimanjaro.  The close proximity of Kenya to Tanzania makes statement 1 a particularly effective distractor.


3. Consider the following concerning the Lipulekh Pass:

1.  Situated at the tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan.
2.  Located in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand.
3.  Reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.
4.  Currently a major trading route between India and China.
5.  A significant pass in the Kumaon region.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the characteristics of the Lipulekh Pass?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct. The Lipulekh Pass is indeed situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand (2), it significantly shortens the journey for pilgrims to Kailash Mansarovar (3), and it's a major pass within the Kumaon region (5).  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the tri-junction involves India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  Statement 4 is also inaccurate; while it was previously used for trade, border trade through Lipulekh is currently suspended. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Lipulekh Pass's geographical location and its significance for pilgrimage, thereby challenging the candidate's ability to recall specific facts and evaluate their accuracy. The inclusion of Bhutan as a neighboring country is a potent distractor.


4. Consider the following aspects of the Suez Canal route:

1. Connects the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
2. Shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.
3. Located in Egypt.
4.  Recently saw a significant increase in Indian fuel exports to Europe.
5.  Completely avoids the Cape of Good Hope route.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the Suez Canal route?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Suez Canal does provide the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe (2), and it's situated in Egypt (3). However, statement 1 is incorrect; it connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Statement 4 is also inaccurate; while it's true that Indian fuel exports to Europe have shifted, the statement is an oversimplification, and the shift is from using the Suez Canal *to* using the Cape of Good Hope route. Finally, statement 5 is factually incorrect, as the Cape of Good Hope route is an alternative, not entirely avoided. This question tests knowledge of global trade routes and their geographical context, particularly relating to the Suez Canal and its importance for maritime transport.  The inclusion of the Cape of Good Hope route as a potential distractor enhances the question's difficulty.



5. Consider the following regarding India-Maldives relations:

1.  Maldives is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  India launched RuPay cards in the Maldives.
3.  A currency swap agreement exists between India and the Maldives.
4.  India is constructing a new naval base at Uthuru Thilafalhu.
5.  The "India Out" campaign was initiated by India.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct.  India has indeed introduced RuPay cards in the Maldives (2), a currency swap agreement is in place (3), and India is building a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (4). However, statement 1 is incorrect; Bangladesh, not the Maldives, is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  Statement 5 is also false; the "India Out" campaign was a movement within the Maldives advocating for the reduction of Indian influence, not initiated by India itself.  The question assesses knowledge of contemporary international relations, specifically focusing on the bilateral relationship between India and the Maldives. The inclusion of inaccurate statements related to trade and the origin of the "India Out" campaign serves as effective distractors.


6.  Consider the following statements about the India-Bangladesh relationship:

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh project.
3.  Bangladesh is a member of the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.
4.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports crude oil.
5.  The Sundarbans mangrove forest is entirely located in Bangladesh.

How many of the above statements are accurate descriptions of the India-Bangladesh relationship?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia (1), the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative project (2), and Bangladesh participates in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect; the pipeline transports natural gas, not crude oil. Statement 5 is also false; a significant portion of the Sundarbans is located in India (West Bengal).  The question tests knowledge of the multifaceted relationship between India and Bangladesh, encompassing trade, energy, and environmental aspects.  The inclusion of statements concerning the type of fuel in the pipeline and the geographical extent of the Sundarbans makes the question more challenging.



7. Consider the following regarding cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:

1.  India and Nepal are collaborating on the Arun III hydropower project.
2.  The Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor connects India and Bhutan.
3.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports electricity.
4.  Bangladesh joined the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation (SASEC) initiative.
5.  The TAPI pipeline facilitates electricity trade.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 1 and 4 are entirely accurate.  The Arun III hydropower project involves India and Nepal (1), and Bangladesh is a member of SASEC, a regional economic cooperation initiative that indirectly supports energy cooperation (though not directly electricity trade in this specific context).  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Katihar-Bornagar corridor connects different parts of India, not India and Bhutan. Statement 3 is also false; the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports petroleum products, not electricity. Lastly, statement 5 is inaccurate; the TAPI pipeline transports natural gas, not electricity. This question tests knowledge of regional energy cooperation initiatives and requires candidates to distinguish between different types of infrastructure projects and their associated countries.  The use of similar-sounding pipeline names as distractors increases the difficulty level.



8. Consider the following about the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC):

1.  It was adopted in 1993.
2.  It mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles.
3.  Israel is a signatory to the CWC.
4.  The CWC includes provisions for verification and inspection.
5.  India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act in 2001.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the Chemical Weapons Convention?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 4, and 5 are correct. The CWC does indeed mandate the complete destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles (2), includes strong verification and inspection measures (4), and India enacted its implementing legislation in 2000 (not 2001, but close enough to be a distractor) (5). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the CWC was adopted in 1992, not 1993.  Statement 3 is also false; Israel is not a signatory to the CWC.  The question tests knowledge of international arms control treaties, requiring candidates to recall key facts about the CWC's provisions and its implementation. The close dates and the inclusion of a non-signatory state as a distractor increase the difficulty.


9. Consider the following regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) was established in 2000.
2.  Atoms4Food is an IAEA program focused on improving global food security.
3.  The IAEA promotes nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions through its Atoms4NetZero program.
4.  The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action focuses solely on avian influenza.
5. The IAEA is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the IAEA's activities and programs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statements 2 and 3 are correct. Atoms4Food is an IAEA program aimed at enhancing global food security (2), and Atoms4NetZero focuses on promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions (3). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the ITDB's establishment date is earlier than 2000. Statement 4 is also false; the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action addresses a broader range of zoonotic diseases, not solely avian influenza. Finally, statement 5 is incorrect; the IAEA's headquarters are in Vienna, Austria. This question assesses knowledge of international organizations and their specific programs, demanding detailed recall of facts about the IAEA's activities.  The inclusion of incorrect dates and the narrowing of the scope of a program are effective distractors.



10. Consider the following concerning the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):

1.  The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2023.
2.  India was classified as a "role-modeling" country in the GCI 2024.
3.  The GCI assesses national cybersecurity commitments across five pillars.
4.  The ITU is headquartered in New York City.
5.  The GCI primarily focuses on the development of new cybersecurity technologies.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the ITU's activities and the GCI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 5 are correct.  India was indeed categorized as a "role-modeling" country in the GCI 2024 (2), the GCI evaluates cybersecurity commitments across five pillars (3), and the index focuses on national-level commitments and strategies, including technology but not solely on technology development (5). However, statement 1 is incorrect; the GCI 2024, not 2023, was released. Statement 4 is also false; the ITU's headquarters is in Geneva, Switzerland. This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their reports, demanding specific details about the ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index.  The incorrect year and location are effective distractors.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and the Maldives signifies a broader economic and security collaboration. The introduction of RuPay in the Maldives aims to expand India's financial reach and influence. The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) is a standard economic tool to improve liquidity and manage exchange rate volatility, a key component of economic diplomacy.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is designed to transport petroleum products, primarily refined fuels, not crude oil.  The inclusion of this inaccurate statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the project.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border energy cooperation in South Asia:**

However, statement 2 is incorrect; the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Nepal, not Bhutan. This incorrect statement serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise understanding of regional infrastructure projects.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 accurately reflect the India-Australia relationship.  The ECTA of 2022 is a major economic milestone.  Space MAITRI represents a key area of collaboration.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the CSP was established in 2020, not 2010.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; AUSINDEX is a maritime exercise, not solely focused on air force cooperation.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The AIIB focuses on infrastructure development in Asia and is a multilateral development bank with diverse membership.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the AIIB's focus includes low and middle-income countries as well.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the AIIB provides both loans and grants as part of its financial assistance. The inclusion of these incorrect statements serves as a key distractor, requiring a detailed understanding of the AIIB's operational mechanisms.

The FATF's primary role is evaluating countries' efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing using MERs, a peer-reviewed process. Finally, the CCPCJ actively works to combat transnational organized crime and engages youth in crime prevention and criminal justice reform through initiatives such as Generation Justice.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.

**Explanation:**

Three out of the four statements are accurate. The AIIB does indeed focus on providing financial assistance for infrastructure projects in developing nations. OPEC+, a coalition of oil-producing countries, has a history of influencing global oil prices through output adjustments, and the statement reflects a recent instance of this. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations.  However, the statement about the Five Eyes Alliance allowing non-citizen residents from member countries to join its armed forces is not a universally applicable or consistently implemented policy across all Five Eyes nations.  The policy varies significantly between the member states. Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 3 correctly points out that NAM's support for Cuba underscores its relevance to Global South nations.  Statement 4 is partially correct, but the list's composition might change, therefore, this option is incomplete as the list is dynamic.  Options (b), (c), and (d) either exclude correct statements or include an inaccurate one. Therefore, the most comprehensive and accurate set of statements is (a).

How many of the above statements accurately describe India's relationship with the Commonwealth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  India is indeed the largest member by population within the Commonwealth. India did host the CHOGM in 1983, and it did establish the Commonwealth Sub-Window. However, statement 2 is incorrect. While India is a significant contributor, it is not the *largest* financial contributor.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the facts.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer as it accurately reflects three correct statements.


4. Consider the following regarding India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing as assessed by the FATF Mutual Evaluation Report (MER):

1.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.

How many of the above are correctly identified as Indian measures in the context of the FATF MER?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly identify aspects of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework, as assessed by the FATF. The PMLA and UAPA are key legislative tools. The FIU-IND plays a crucial role in financial intelligence gathering, and the ED is actively involved in enforcement.  Therefore, all four are accurate in this context, making (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly underestimate the number of accurate statements.


5. Consider the following regarding the UNODC's World Drug Day report:

1.  Cannabis is identified as the most abused drug globally.
2.  The Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) is highlighted as a region significantly affected by drug trafficking.
3.  The Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) is still referred to by that name in the report.
4.  The report details cannabis legalization in Canada, Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions.

How many of the above accurately reflect key highlights of the UNODC's World Drug Day report?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate reflections of the UNODC report. Cannabis is indeed the most widely abused drug. The Triple Frontier Area is consistently cited as a major drug trafficking hub.  The report also discusses cannabis legalization in various regions. However, statement 3 is inaccurate; the Golden Triangle is often referred to as the "Death Triangle" in updated reports, reflecting the severity of the drug problem.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate, leading to (c) as the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the accuracy of the statements.


6. Consider the following regarding the IAEA's activities:

How many of the above accurately reflect key IAEA programmes and activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe IAEA programmes. The ITDB tracks nuclear material theft. Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero are legitimate initiatives focusing on food security and net-zero emissions, respectively.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; while preventing nuclear proliferation is a crucial part of the IAEA's mandate, it's not its *exclusive* focus. The IAEA's work encompasses a broader range of peaceful uses of nuclear technology.  Hence, (c) is the correct answer, as only three statements are accurate.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the accuracy of the descriptions.


7. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international organizations:

1.  India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. India is indeed a signatory to the CWC, and it is a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while India's external affairs minister participated in a meeting, the specific grouping's name might require clarification.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; India is an active participant in the EAS, but it isn't a permanent member in the same way as ASEAN members are. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are definitively correct, making (c) the right answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain inaccurate statements.

3.  An amendment exempted India from CAATSA sanctions for purchasing the S-400 missile defense system.
4.  CAATSA sanctions are exclusively focused on military acquisitions.


How many of the above statements accurately describe CAATSA and its implications for India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe CAATSA.  It was enacted in 2017, targets countries with deep ties to Russia, North Korea, and Iran, and a specific amendment did exempt India regarding the S-400 purchase. However, statement 4 is incorrect; while military acquisitions are a significant area of concern under CAATSA, the act's scope extends beyond purely military deals, encompassing broader economic and political engagements. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer as it reflects three accurate statements.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the accuracy of the statements.

4.  IMEC's primary focus is on enhancing energy security.

How many of the above accurately reflect the objectives and anticipated impacts of IMEC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is definitively accurate. IMEC is indeed considered a cornerstone of global connectivity.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are speculative or overly specific. While IMEC may indirectly strengthen trade with the EU, its scope is broader. The development of seaports is a possibility, but not a confirmed component.  Energy security is not the primary focus.  Therefore, (a) is correct, as only one statement accurately reflects IMEC's stated objectives. Options (b), (c), and (d) include speculative or inaccurate claims.


10. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. Belarus's recent accession is a fact. Countering terrorism and extremism is a central theme of SCO activities, and a formal anti-drug strategy exists. Statement 4 is incorrect; while Central Asian countries are key members, the SCO's membership extends beyond this region.  Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as three statements accurately reflect the SCO.  Options (a), (b), and (d) misrepresent the accuracy of the statements.


11. Consider the following regarding the Group of Seven (G7):

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The G7 does use a rotating presidency, and it did launch the PGII. However, statement 2 is inaccurate; the G7 lacks a permanent secretariat. Statement 4 is also incorrect; India is an invited guest or outreach country, not a permanent member.  Therefore, (b) is correct as it reflects two accurate statements.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include inaccurate statements.

How many of the above statements accurately describe IPOI?

(a) Only one

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. IPOI aims for a free and open Indo-Pacific, was launched by India in 2019, and builds upon the SAGAR initiative. However, statement 1 is incorrect; IPOI is a non-treaty based arrangement. Therefore, (c) is correct, as three statements accurately describe IPOI. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain an inaccurate statement.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Three EFTA members are part of the EEA, and the TEPA aims to boost trade. However, statement 1 is incorrect; EFTA is not a customs union like the EU.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate; EFTA members maintain their individual external tariffs. Therefore, (b) is the correct answer, as only two statements are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) contain inaccurate statements.


14. Consider the following regarding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe the IPEF and its Supply Chain Agreement. India's Vice-Chairmanship, the existence of a Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board are all accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect; IPEF's primary focus is on economic cooperation, not military matters. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as three statements are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain an inaccurate statement.


15. Consider the following regarding the UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF):

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The UN-GSCF was indeed inaugurated in Barbados, it did introduce digital solutions, and climate change is a key focus. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the UN-GSCF aims to strengthen resilience, it prioritizes Small Island Developing States (SIDS) due to their specific vulnerabilities. Therefore, (c) is the correct answer, as three statements are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain an inaccurate statement.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Lake Turkana is situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, not northeastern Kenya.  Statement 2 is correct; Lake Turkana is indeed Africa's largest permanent desert lake and the world's largest permanent alkaline lake. Statement 3 is also correct; the Omo River is the main source of water for Lake Turkana. Statement 4 is incorrect; a recent survey actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in the lake. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 3) are correct. The question plays on the geographical location and the recent survey findings, creating plausible distractors.

(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. Statement 2 is incorrect; it is the *highest* free-standing mountain, not the lowest. Statement 3 is incorrect; it's a stratovolcano, not a shield volcano, and composed of ash, lava, and rock, not primarily basalt.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect key aspects of the India-Maldives relationship, encompassing both cooperation and points of contention?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately represent different facets of the complex India-Maldives relationship. Statements 1 and 2 highlight cooperative efforts: the introduction of RuPay cards expands financial access and integration, while the Currency Swap Agreement demonstrates India's support for the Maldivian economy. Statement 3 signifies India's strategic security engagement in the region through infrastructure development, enhancing maritime security cooperation. Statement 4 reflects a point of tension, indicating a period where the Maldivian government's approach leaned towards pro-China policies and questioned India's military presence.  Therefore, the combination of cooperative initiatives and areas of divergence makes all four statements relevant to understanding the multifaceted nature of India-Maldives relations.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the listed elements are directly linked to India's enhanced connectivity with Central Asia. The INSTC is a crucial multimodal transport network designed to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia, providing an alternative to traditional routes. The Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar Port serves as a key gateway, offering a direct sea route to Afghanistan and facilitating access to Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. The Gulf of Oman is the geographical location of Chabahar Port, making it integral to the port's functionality and strategic importance. The Suez Canal, while a significant global shipping route, is not directly involved in the specific initiatives aimed at enhancing India's connectivity with Central Asia via the INSTC and Chabahar Port.


**4. Consider the following about India's relations with its neighbours:**

1.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner.

How many of the above initiatives directly relate to cross-border electricity trade or energy cooperation within South Asia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two of the listed initiatives directly pertain to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia. The Arun III hydropower project and the upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar both focus on electricity generation and transmission across borders, facilitating energy exchange.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline and the TAPI gas pipeline, while involved in energy infrastructure, primarily concern natural gas transportation, not electricity. Therefore, only two options are directly related to cross-border electricity trade.


**6. Consider the following organizations and initiatives:**

1.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
2.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
3.  The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) network
4.  The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023

How many of the above are involved in combating transnational crime, corruption, or enhancing national security?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four entities are involved in combating transnational crime, corruption, or enhancing national security in different ways. The FATF assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The UNODC addresses transnational organized crime and drug trafficking. The GLOBE network focuses on international anti-corruption efforts. The Inter-services Organisations Act aims to improve command and control within India's military, enhancing national security. Thus, all four are relevant to the broader theme of combating crime and bolstering security.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's engagement in multilateral platforms:**

1.  SAARC
2.  BIMSTEC
3.  BBIN
4.  IORA
5.  The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative

How many of the above represent multilateral platforms in which India actively participates, focusing on regional cooperation or broader geopolitical engagement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five options represent multilateral platforms where India plays an active role. SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) is a South Asian regional organization. BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) focuses on cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region. BBIN (Bangladesh-Bhutan-India-Nepal) initiative promotes regional connectivity. IORA (Indian Ocean Rim Association) focuses on cooperation among Indian Ocean Rim countries. The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a broader geopolitical initiative involving several countries in the Indo-Pacific region.  Therefore, India's engagement spans all five platforms.


**8. Consider the following statements about the UN and related entities:**

1.  The UN Peacekeeping Force (UNPK) received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988.
2.  India is a significant contributor of military personnel to UNPK.
3.  The UNCTAD celebrated its 60th anniversary.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the roles and activities of the UN and its associated organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All four statements are factually correct. The UNPK, indeed, received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988 for its contributions to global peace and security. India has consistently been among the largest troop-contributing countries to UN peacekeeping missions. The UNCTAD (United Nations Conference on Trade and Development) marked its 60th anniversary. UNESCAP (United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific) regularly publishes the "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific," a key publication analyzing the economic and social trends in the Asia-Pacific region.  Therefore, all four statements accurately reflect the activities of the UN and its related entities.


**9. Consider the following related to India's engagement with other countries:**

1.  India and Vietnam have a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership."
2.  India handed over the INS Kirpan to Vietnam.
3.  Malaysia joined the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA).
4.  India and Malaysia have a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership."


How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's bilateral relations with Vietnam and Malaysia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Three out of the four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's relationships with Vietnam and Malaysia.  India and Vietnam indeed have a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership," reflecting a high level of bilateral cooperation.  India did hand over the INS Kirpan, a missile corvette, to Vietnam, strengthening their defense cooperation.  Malaysia's joining of the IBCA indicates a shared commitment to wildlife conservation, although not directly a bilateral engagement with India.  The statement about India and Malaysia having a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" is also correct.  Therefore, three statements correctly describe aspects of these bilateral relationships.


**10. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international conventions:**

1.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
2.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC)
3.  The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution

How many of the above represent international conventions or legal frameworks to which India is a signatory or has implemented domestically, focusing on international cooperation or national security?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the listed items represent international conventions or legal frameworks relevant to India's participation in international cooperation or domestic security. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), reflecting its commitment to non-proliferation.  India has ratified the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), demonstrating its commitment to combating organized crime at an international level.  India is also a party to the SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution. The Inter-services Organisations Act is a domestic law focusing on national security and not an international convention.  Therefore, three of the options accurately reflect India's engagement with international legal frameworks.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements are accurate reflections of India's bilateral relationships.

Joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN highlight the defense cooperation between the two nations. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline demonstrates collaborative efforts in the energy sector. Finally, Nepal's reservations regarding the long-term environmental and sustainability impacts of the BBIN (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal) initiative are well-documented. Therefore, all four statements accurately represent aspects of India's foreign policy and regional collaborations.


**2. Consider the following features related to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. It is a multi-modal transportation network.
2. It aims to connect India with Russia and Europe.
3. It involves a total distance of approximately 7,200 km.
4.  It bypasses Pakistan, providing an alternate route to Central Asia.

Which of the above features accurately describe the INSTC?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The INSTC is indeed a multi-modal transport network (1), designed to connect India with Russia and Europe (2) via a route approximately 7,200 km long (3).  Crucially, the INSTC offers an alternative route to Central Asia that bypasses Pakistan (4), a significant geopolitical factor. However, statement 5 is incorrect. The INSTC is a multi-modal corridor, utilizing land, sea, and rail transport, not primarily air freight. Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include statement 5.


**3. Consider the following regarding the Chabahar Port:**

1.  It is located on the Gulf of Oman.
2.  It facilitates a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.
3.  India signed a 5-year agreement with Iran for its development.
4.  It is a key component of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Chabahar Port's location on the Gulf of Oman, its role in providing an alternate route to Afghanistan (bypassing Pakistan), and its integration with the INSTC are all accurate. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  India signed a 10-year agreement, not a 5-year agreement, with Iran for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar Port.  This error makes options (a), (b), and (d) incorrect.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with Bhutan:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007, forms the basis of their relationship.

3.  India has constructed several major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, which supply electricity to India.
4.  The Indian Military Training Team (IMTRAT) is permanently stationed in eastern Bhutan.


Which of the above statements are accurate descriptions of India-Bhutan relations?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the nature of India-Bhutan relations.  The 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, renewed in 2007, underpins their relationship.  India has also played a significant role in developing Bhutan's hydroelectric power sector, benefiting both countries. However, statement 2 is incorrect; India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, but the trade balance is significantly in *India's* favor, not Bhutan's. Statement 4 is also inaccurate; IMTRAT is stationed in *western*, not eastern, Bhutan.  These inaccuracies make options (b), (c), and (d) incorrect.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF plenary in Singapore adopted the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India.
2. The MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The FATF did adopt India's MER, the MER assesses measures against money laundering and terrorist financing, and the PMLA is a key Indian law in this area.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2015.  This makes options (a), (b), and (d) incorrect.


**6. Consider the following about the Colombo Process:**

(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. India did chair a meeting, the Colombo Process is a regional South Asian initiative, and it has strong links with the CSC.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; while the Colombo Process addresses various security and migration challenges, its primary focus is not solely on drug trafficking. This makes options (a), (b), and (d) incorrect.


**7. Consider the following regarding Lake Turkana:**

1.  It is located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
2.  It is Africa's largest permanent desert lake.
3.  Its primary water source is the Omo River.
4. A recent survey revealed low fish potential in Lake Turkana.


How many of the statements above are correct?

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in both Kenya and Ethiopia and the Omo River is its main source. Statement 2 is partially correct; it's Africa's largest *permanent* desert lake, but not necessarily the largest overall.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the survey actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential. Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Raigad Fort:**

1.  It is located in Gujarat.
2.  It is referred to as the "Gibraltar of the East."
3.  It was a key military stronghold for the Maratha Empire.
4.  It is situated on a coastal plain.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the Raigad Fort?

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. The Raigad Fort is indeed known as the "Gibraltar of the East" due to its strong defenses, and it served as a crucial military base for the Maratha Empire.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; the Raigad Fort is located in Maharashtra, not Gujarat.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; it's situated atop a steep hill, not a coastal plain. Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.



**9. Consider the following regarding the Minimum Support Prices (MSP) in India:**

1.  Tur/arhar is covered under the MSP scheme.
2.  Rapeseed is not covered under the MSP scheme.
3.  Jute is covered under the MSP scheme.

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  While the exact list of crops covered under MSP can vary slightly,  Tur/arhar, Jute, and Safflower are generally included.  Rapeseed and Niger seed are less frequently or inconsistently included in the MSP scheme. Therefore, at least four of the statements can be considered correct, depending on the specific year and government policy.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Oil Seed Production in India:**

1. India is among the top three oilseed producers globally.
2.  Cottonseed is a primary oilseed crop in India.
3.  Tree-borne oils are considered secondary sources of oilseeds in India.
4.  India's oilseed production significantly contributes to its agricultural GDP.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2 and 3 are accurate. Cottonseed is indeed a primary oilseed crop, and tree-borne oils are secondary sources. Statement 4 is also largely true; oilseed production plays a substantial role in India's agricultural economy.  However, statement 1 is incorrect; India is a major producer but not consistently among the top *three* globally. Therefore, three of the statements are correct.




**1. Consider the following statements related to India's engagement with international organizations:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts peer reviews of countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by FATF was first adopted in 2010.
3. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
4. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a key mechanism to tackle transnational organized crime.
5. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All five statements accurately reflect information regarding India's involvement in various international organizations and their activities.  The FATF indeed conducts peer reviews, assessing countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, as stated. The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently highlights cannabis as a leading substance of abuse. The Palermo Convention (UNTOC) is a cornerstone international agreement in combating transnational organized crime, and India is a signatory. Finally, India's membership in SAWEN is also a matter of public record.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's bilateral relations:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2. India and Bangladesh engage in military exercises such as SAMPRITI and MILAN.

6.  India and Russia jointly produce Brahmos cruise missiles.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's bilateral relations?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) All six

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All six statements accurately depict facets of India's relationships with Bangladesh, Maldives, and Russia.  Bangladesh's position as India's largest South Asian trading partner is well-documented.  The joint military exercises (SAMPRITI and MILAN) between India and Bangladesh are ongoing collaborations. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a real energy cooperation project. The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives is a recent development aimed at stabilizing the Maldivian economy. The Greater Male Connectivity Project represents a significant infrastructure undertaking by India in the Maldives. Finally, the joint production of Brahmos missiles exemplifies the military collaboration between India and Russia.  Each statement is factually accurate and reflects existing bilateral initiatives.


**3. Consider the following regarding international conventions and agreements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
3. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC).
4. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
5. The  Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between India and the US aims to secure the mutual timely provision of defence-related goods and services.

How many of these statements accurately describe international conventions and agreements and India’s participation in them?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements are accurate. The Biological Weapons Convention (1972), Chemical Weapons Convention (1993), and the Rome Statute (1998) are all established international agreements with the described purposes. India's status as a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention is also true, reflecting its commitment to non-proliferation. The Security of Supply Arrangement (SOSA) between India and the US is a valid defense agreement serving the purpose stated.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international forums:**

1. India participated in the 50th G7 Summit as an Outreach Country.
2.  Belarus recently joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), becoming its tenth member.
3. India is a Vice-Chair of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework's (IPEF) Supply Chain Council.
4. India was the 18th SOSA partner of the US.
5. India's External Affairs Minister participated in the first-ever Joint Ministerial Meeting of the C-10 and L.69 groupings.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect India's recent participation in international forums?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five statements are factually correct. India's participation in the G7 Summit as an Outreach Country, Belarus's entry into the SCO, India's Vice-Chairmanship of IPEF's Supply Chain Council, India's participation in SOSA, and the External Affairs Minister's participation in the C-10 and L.69 meeting are all verifiable events. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements.


**5. Consider the following statements related to energy cooperation initiatives:**

1.  The India-Nepal-Bhutan energy cooperation involves projects like Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects.
2. The India-Bangladesh energy cooperation includes an upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar.
3. The TAPI pipeline is designed to transport natural gas.
4. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is another energy infrastructure project.
5.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports crude oil.

How many of the above statements accurately describe energy cooperation initiatives involving India?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four out of the five statements are correct.  The India-Nepal-Bhutan energy cooperation does indeed involve the mentioned hydropower projects. The electricity corridor between Katihar and Bornagar is a planned initiative. The TAPI pipeline is designed for natural gas transportation. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a real project. However, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports refined petroleum products (not crude oil), making the fifth statement incorrect.  The other statements accurately reflect existing energy cooperation projects.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims for "difficult" by incorporating closely related but incorrect options and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention)
2. The South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)
3. The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network
4. The  Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process

How many of the above are mechanisms or initiatives directly involved in combating transnational organized crime or corruption?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four options represent mechanisms or initiatives directly related to combating transnational organized crime or corruption.  UNTOC is a foundational international treaty. SAWEN specifically targets wildlife crime, a significant aspect of transnational organized crime. GLOBE focuses on international anti-corruption law enforcement cooperation.  The FATF MER process assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, key components of transnational organized crime.  Therefore, all four are correctly linked to the broader theme of countering such crimes. There are no incorrect elements presented here.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023
2. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS)
3. Operation Vijay (1999)
4. The appointment of a Vice Chief of Defence Staff (CDS)

How many of the above relate directly to the organizational structure or recent developments within India's national security apparatus?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Inter-services Organisations Act directly impacts the command structure of India's armed forces. The NSCS is a key advisory body for national security. The appointment of a Vice CDS is a recent development within the military's organizational structure.  Operation Vijay, while a significant event, is a specific military operation and not a structural element of the national security apparatus itself. Thus, three of the four elements are directly related to the organizational structure or recent developments within India's national security apparatus.


**3. Consider the following:**

1. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
2. The Biological Weapons Convention
3. The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)
4. The  India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline

How many of the above are international agreements or initiatives focused on preventing the use or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or addressing international crimes?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The CWC, the Biological Weapons Convention, and the Rome Statute are all international legal instruments aimed at preventing the use or proliferation of weapons of mass destruction or addressing international crimes like genocide and war crimes. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, while a significant infrastructure project, is not directly related to weapons of mass destruction or international criminal law.  Therefore, only three of the items fit the specified criteria.



**4. Consider the following regions:**

1. The Golden Crescent (now Death Crescent)
2. The Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle)
3. The Triple Frontier Area
4. The Indo-Pacific region

How many of the above are regions known for significant illicit drug trafficking activities?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Golden Crescent, Golden Triangle, and Triple Frontier Area are all notorious for significant illicit drug production and trafficking. While the Indo-Pacific region faces challenges related to drug trafficking, it is not primarily defined by that activity.  The other three regions are historically and currently significant centers for drug production and trafficking of narcotics.


**5. Consider the following organizations:**

1. The Commonwealth
2. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
3. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
4. The Group of Seven (G7)

How many of the above are primarily intergovernmental organizations focused on political or economic cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth, GCC, SCO, and G7 are all intergovernmental organizations with primary focuses on political and/or economic cooperation among their member states.  Each organization has a distinct focus and membership, but all fall under the umbrella of intergovernmental cooperation.


**6. Consider the following:**

1. The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)
2. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
3. The Quad
4. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)

How many of the above are regional organizations with a significant focus on economic or security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific or South Asian regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

BIMSTEC, SAARC, the Quad, and IPEF all involve multiple countries in either South Asia or the broader Indo-Pacific region and have aspects of their agendas dedicated to economic or security cooperation. While their specific focuses and memberships differ, all four are regional organizations with a significant focus on either economic or security cooperation within their respective regions.


**7. Consider the following:**

1. The  World Press Freedom Index (WPFI)
2. The  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)
3. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
4. The  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

How many of the above are international or multinational organizations focused on areas other than purely economic development?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The WPFI assesses press freedom globally, the CLGF focuses on local governance,  the AIIB focuses on infrastructure financing, but also has a social impact, and the UNODC addresses drug control and crime.  While AIIB has an economic development focus, it also has broader social and governance implications. All four organizations thus operate beyond a purely economic development mandate.


**8. Consider the following:**

1. The  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
2. The  Cross-border electricity trade initiatives between India, Nepal, and Bangladesh
3. The  Supply Chain Agreement under the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
4. The  Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant

How many of the above initiatives directly relate to enhancing economic connectivity or cooperation in the Indo-Pacific or South Asian regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IMEC aims to boost economic connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  The cross-border electricity trade initiative enhances energy cooperation in South Asia. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement focuses on strengthening regional supply chains. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a specific project enhancing energy cooperation between India and Bangladesh.  Therefore, all four initiatives directly relate to enhancing economic connectivity or cooperation in the specified regions.


1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS):

1. The CDS post was created in 2019 with the rank equivalent to a four-star General.
2. The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functions as its secretary.
3. The CDS exercises military command over the three Service Chiefs.
4. Tri-service agencies related to Cyber and Space will be under the command of the CDS.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The CDS post was indeed created in 2019 at the rank equivalent to a four-star General. The CDS heads the DMA and serves as its secretary, playing a crucial role in coordinating the activities of the three services.  Furthermore,  tri-service agencies/organizations/commands related to Cyber and Space are indeed under the CDS's command, reflecting the increasing importance of these domains in modern warfare.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. A key aspect of the CDS's role is that they *do not* exercise direct military command over the three Service Chiefs. The Service Chiefs retain their operational command over their respective branches.  The CDS acts as a principal military advisor and coordinator, not a direct superior in the chain of command. This distinction is crucial to understanding the structure and functioning of India's military establishment.


2. Consider the following regarding the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS):

1. The NSCS was constituted in 1999 based on the recommendations of a task force.
2. The NSCS comprises ministers of Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs.
3. The NSCS includes the Strategic Policy Group (SPG) and the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB).
4. The NSCS directly commands the Andaman and Nicobar Command.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the NSCS?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The NSCS was indeed constituted in 1999 based on the recommendations of a task force (the K.C. Pant-led task force).  The NSCS's structure includes the SPG, which ensures inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies, and the NSAB, which provides long-term analysis and policy recommendations.  However, statement 2 is incorrect; the NSC, not the NSCS, comprises the ministers of Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs.  The NSCS is the secretariat that supports the NSC. Statement 4 is also incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Command, being a tri-services command, does not fall under the direct command of the NSCS.  The NSCS provides support and coordination for national security, but operational command of military units rests with the respective service chiefs and their commands.


3. Consider the following about the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:

1. It empowers the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) with disciplinary powers.
2. An ISO includes troops subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957.
3. The Act grants the C-i-C absolute authority, overriding existing service-specific laws.
4. The Act specifically excludes the Strategic Forces Command from its purview.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect the provisions of the Act?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The Act does empower the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs with disciplinary and administrative powers over personnel.  An ISO is defined as a body of troops from different services, subject to at least two of the three service-specific acts.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the Act grants significant authority to the C-i-C, it doesn't override all existing service-specific laws completely.  There are likely provisions for reconciliation or appeals within the existing legal framework.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Act's application to various types of inter-service organizations is not explicitly limited to exclude any specific command like the Strategic Forces Command. The scope of the Act needs to be carefully examined to determine its application.  The specifics of the Act are crucial for understanding its impact on the organizational structure and disciplinary processes within the Indian armed forces.


4. Consider the following statements about the Kargil War and Operation Vijay:

1. Operation Vijay aimed to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Operation Vijay was launched in response to the 1998 Pokhran nuclear tests.
3. The success of Operation Vijay marked the beginning of India's nuclear deterrence policy.
4. Operation Vijay was solely conducted by the Indian Army, without significant support from the Air Force or Navy.


Which of the above statements are accurate regarding Operation Vijay?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 1 and 4
(c) 2 and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely accurate. Operation Vijay's primary objective was indeed to remove Pakistani soldiers and militants who had infiltrated the Kargil district.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Operation Vijay was a response to Pakistani infiltration, not the 1998 nuclear tests.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while Operation Vijay demonstrated India's military capabilities, it wasn't the direct *beginning* of India's nuclear deterrence policy, which had already been under development. Statement 4 is incorrect because Operation Vijay involved a coordinated effort between the Indian Army, Air Force, and Navy. This tri-service cooperation is a significant aspect of the operation's success.  Understanding the context and specifics of Operation Vijay is important for analyzing India's national security strategies and military capabilities.


5. Consider the following regarding the  Financial Action Task Force (FATF):

1. The FATF assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) was first adopted in 2010.
3. The FATF's recommendations are legally binding on member countries.
4. The FATF directly enforces its recommendations through sanctions.


Which of the above statements accurately describe the FATF’s role and functions?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The FATF's primary function is to assess countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the FATF's recommendations are not legally binding. They serve as international standards and best practices, influencing national legislation and policies but lacking direct legal enforcement power.  Similarly, statement 4 is incorrect; the FATF doesn't directly enforce its recommendations through sanctions.  While non-compliance can lead to reputational damage and pressure from other countries or international organizations, the FATF itself does not impose direct sanctions.  A nuanced understanding of the FATF's role as a standard-setting body, rather than a direct enforcement agency, is crucial in international financial regulation.


6. Consider the following regarding the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors illicit nuclear trafficking.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program uses nuclear techniques to improve food security.
3.  The IAEA directly regulates nuclear power plant safety standards globally.
4.  The IAEA enforces international nuclear non-proliferation treaties through sanctions.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the IAEA's activities and roles?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  The IAEA's ITDB does indeed monitor and report on illicit nuclear trafficking.  The Atoms4Food program uses nuclear technologies to enhance food production and security. However, statement 3 is incorrect. While the IAEA sets safety standards and provides guidance, it doesn't directly regulate the safety of nuclear power plants globally. That responsibility primarily lies with individual countries' regulatory bodies.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. The IAEA promotes nuclear non-proliferation, but it doesn't directly enforce treaties through sanctions.  Enforcement mechanisms are usually handled through the UN Security Council or other international agreements.  It's vital to understand the IAEA's role as a collaborative and standard-setting organization, not a direct regulatory or enforcement body with global jurisdiction.


7. Consider the following international organizations:

1.  The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
2.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
3.  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)
4.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)


How many of the above are regional intergovernmental organizations focused primarily on security cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only NATO and the SCO primarily focus on security cooperation among their member states. NATO is a military alliance focused on collective defense, while the SCO has a significant security component in its mandate, addressing issues like terrorism and regional stability.  The GCC and BIMSTEC, while having security considerations within their broader mandates, are more focused on economic cooperation and regional development.  The GCC centers around economic and political cooperation among its member states in the Persian Gulf region, while BIMSTEC focuses on broader economic and technical cooperation in the Bay of Bengal region.  Therefore, only two of the listed organizations prioritize security cooperation as their primary focus.  Distinguishing between organizations with security as a primary or secondary goal is crucial for understanding regional dynamics and international relations.


8. Consider the following regarding the Geneva Conventions of 1949:

1. They are the cornerstone of International Humanitarian Law (IHL).
2. They primarily address the treatment of civilians in times of war.
3. They establish clear rules for the conduct of warfare, including the protection of medical personnel.
4. They are legally binding on all nations, regardless of their ratification status.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the content and impact of the Geneva Conventions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Geneva Conventions are indeed foundational to IHL, providing rules for the humane treatment of those not participating in hostilities (civilians and medical personnel). They establish rules for warfare, including protections for the wounded, prisoners of war, and medical personnel. However, statement 4 is incorrect. While the Geneva Conventions are widely recognized and considered customary international law, their legal binding nature depends on a nation's ratification.  A state must explicitly ratify the conventions to be formally bound by their provisions.  The distinction between customary international law and formally ratified treaties is crucial to understanding the legal framework governing international relations and the protection of individuals during armed conflict.


9. Consider the following about the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC):

1. The UNODC released the World Drug Report annually.
2. The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme aims to reduce illicit firearms trafficking.
3. The UNODC directly enforces drug laws within member countries.
4. The UNODC's work focuses solely on illicit drugs and does not address related transnational crimes.


How many of the statements accurately reflect the UNODC's mandate and activities?

(a) 1 and 2
(b) 2 and 3
(c) 3 and 4
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. The UNODC does release an annual World Drug Report and has a Global Firearms Programme to combat illicit arms trafficking, recognizing the link between firearms and organized crime.  However, statement 3 is incorrect; the UNODC doesn't directly enforce drug laws within member states.  Enforcement is primarily the responsibility of individual countries' law enforcement agencies.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the UNODC's mandate extends beyond illicit drugs to address related transnational organized crimes, including corruption, human trafficking, and money laundering. The interconnectedness of these issues is a key focus of the UNODC's work.  Understanding the UNODC's role as a collaborative agency promoting international cooperation rather than direct enforcement is critical to comprehending global efforts to combat drug trafficking and related crimes.


10. Consider the following regarding the  International Telecommunication Union (ITU):

1. The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI).
2.  The ITU directly manages internet infrastructure globally.
3.  The ITU sets international standards for telecommunications technologies.
4. The ITU enforces its standards through international sanctions.


Which of the above statements correctly reflect the ITU’s functions and activities?

(a) 1 and 3
(b) 2 and 4
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The ITU does publish the GCI and plays a significant role in setting international standards for telecommunications.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the ITU doesn't directly manage internet infrastructure.  Internet governance is a complex process involving multiple stakeholders, and the ITU plays a role but doesn't have direct control.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. The ITU doesn't enforce its standards through sanctions.  Its influence comes from its role in setting global standards and promoting international cooperation in the field of telecommunications.  The ITU's influence is based on its authority in developing global standards and facilitating international cooperation, not on coercive measures.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the topics.


**1. Consider the following international organizations:**

1.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)
2.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
3.  Group of Seven (G7)
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)

How many of the above organizations have India as a member or active participant?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) unites local governments from 56 Commonwealth countries, including India.  India actively participates in its meetings. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) engages with India through strategic dialogues and joint action plans.  India is an outreach country for the G7 summit, demonstrating active participation.  Finally, India is a full member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Therefore, India has a significant role in all four organizations. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate India's involvement in these international bodies.


**2. Consider the following statements related to India's engagement with international organizations:**

1.  India hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1983.
2.  India established a Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund.
3.  India's most recent term on the UN Security Council was 2020-2021.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; India did host CHOGM in 1983. Statement 2 is also correct; the Commonwealth Sub-Window was indeed established under the India-UN Development Fund.  Statement 4 is true; India is a member of FATF. However, statement 3 is incorrect. India's most recent non-permanent term on the UN Security Council was 2021-2022, not 2020-2021.  Therefore, only three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the inaccuracy in statement 3.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to India's foreign policy:**

1.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
2.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)
3.  Operation Vijay
4.  Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant

How many of the above initiatives involve significant international collaboration or partnership?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IMEC involves collaboration among India, the Middle East, and Europe for economic connectivity. IPEF is a multilateral framework for economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant represents collaboration between India and Bangladesh. Operation Vijay, however, was a solely Indian military operation. Therefore, three of the initiatives involve substantial international partnership, making (c) the correct choice.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they fail to accurately assess the level of international collaboration in each initiative.


**4. Consider the following international agreements or conventions:**

1.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3.  The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)

How many of the above conventions has India ratified or is a party to?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India is a signatory and party to the Biological Weapons Convention, the Chemical Weapons Convention (and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000), and the Rome Statute of the ICC.  India is also a party to the SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution.  Therefore, India is involved with all four conventions listed, making (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate India's participation in these international legal frameworks.


**5. Consider the following features of the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS):**

1.  It is headed by the Prime Minister of India.
2.  It plays a crucial role in inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies.
3.  It is responsible for the implementation of the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA).
4.  It provides long-term analysis and policy recommendations to the National Security Council (NSC).

How many of the above statements accurately describe the NSCS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The NSCS does not head itself; the NSC, an apex body, is headed by the Prime Minister. The NSCS plays a key role in coordinating national security policies across ministries. The NSCS also provides long-term analysis and recommendations to the NSC.  However, the NSCS is not directly responsible for the implementation of AFSPA; that falls under the Ministry of Defence and other relevant agencies. Therefore, only three statements correctly describe the NSCS, making (c) the correct option. The other options are incorrect because they misrepresent the NSCS's responsibilities and structure.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS):**

1.  The CDS post was created based on the recommendations of a Group of Ministers (GoM) in 2001.
2.  The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functions as its secretary.
3.  The CDS exercises direct military command over the three service chiefs.
4.  The CDS is the Principal Military Adviser to the Ministry of Defence on all tri-services matters.

How many of the statements correctly describe the roles and powers of the CDS?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While a GoM recommended the CDS post, it was formally created in 2019, not 2001.  The CDS does head the DMA and functions as its secretary.  The CDS is indeed the Principal Military Adviser on tri-services matters. However, a crucial point is that the CDS does *not* exercise direct military command over the service chiefs; that remains with the respective service chiefs.  Therefore, only three statements are completely accurate, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because of the inaccuracy regarding the CDS's command authority.


**7. Consider the following international organizations focused on combating illicit activities:**

1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
2.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
4.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)

How many of these organizations play a significant role in addressing transnational organized crime?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FATF focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, key aspects of transnational organized crime. The UNODC addresses various forms of transnational crime, including drug trafficking and organized crime. The INCB monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties, which are often violated by transnational criminal organizations. The CCPCJ works on crime prevention and criminal justice strategies, including tackling transnational crime.  All four organizations listed play significant roles, making (d) the correct option.  The other options are incorrect as they underestimate the breadth of involvement of these organizations in combating transnational crime.


**8. Consider the following related to India's energy collaborations:**

1.  India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline
2.  TAPI Pipeline
3.  Arun III Hydropower Project
4.  Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor

How many of the above initiatives involve cross-border energy cooperation with neighboring countries?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline facilitates gas transportation between the two countries. The TAPI pipeline is a regional project involving multiple countries, including India. The Arun III Hydropower Project involves collaboration with Nepal.  The Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor is a cross-border project between India and Bangladesh.  Therefore, all four initiatives involve cross-border energy cooperation, making (d) the correct answer. The other options are incorrect because they fail to recognize the international nature of these energy projects.



Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to challenge UPSC aspirants.  Each question includes a detailed explanation of the correct answer and why other options are incorrect.


**1. Consider the following features of a prominent African lake:**

1.  Africa's fourth-largest lake.
2.  Largest permanent desert and alkaline lake globally.
3.  Located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
4.  Primary water source is the Omo River.
5.  Subject of a recent comprehensive survey after a 50-year gap, revealing high fish potential.

Which lake is being described?

(a) Lake Victoria
(b) Lake Tanganyika
(c) Lake Turkana
(d) Lake Malawi


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The question describes Lake Turkana.  The features listed accurately reflect its characteristics. Lake Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi, while large African lakes, do not match all the specified criteria.  Lake Victoria, for instance, is much larger than Lake Turkana and isn't primarily located in a desert region.  Lake Tanganyika is long and narrow, and its location differs from the description given. Lake Malawi is known for its biodiversity but doesn't fit the desert/alkaline description. The inclusion of the recent survey adds another layer of difficulty, requiring specific knowledge of recent events related to this lake.


**2. Consider the following geographical features:**

1.  A stratovolcano.
2.  The highest peak in Africa.
3.  Located in Tanzania.
4.  A free-standing mountain, not part of a mountain range.
5.  Made of ash, lava, and rock.

Which mountain is being described?

(a) Mount Kenya
(b) Mount Kilimanjaro
(c) Table Mountain
(d) Mount Elgon


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description perfectly matches Mount Kilimanjaro.  Mount Kenya is also a significant African peak, but it's not the highest. Table Mountain is a distinctive flat-topped mountain in South Africa, and Mount Elgon is located in East Africa but doesn't possess the same characteristics as described. The detail about the mountain being free-standing and composed of volcanic materials further narrows down the options, making it a challenging question for candidates who might only know of the major African mountains.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding a significant mountain pass:**

1.  Located near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal.
2.  Situated in the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand.
3.  Significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.
4.  A major pass in the Kumaun region, situated in the Kali Valley.
5.  Border trade through this pass was halted during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Which mountain pass is described?

(a) Nathu La
(b) Shipki La
(c) Lipulekh Pass
(d) Mana Pass


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The description pinpoints Lipulekh Pass.  While other passes in the Himalayas might share some features, the combination of its location at the tri-junction, its proximity to Kailash Mansarovar, and the specific mention of the COVID-19 closure makes Lipulekh Pass the only correct answer.  The inclusion of the Kumaun region and Kali Valley provides further detail to differentiate it from other Himalayan passes.


**4. Consider the following regarding a crucial maritime route:**

1.  Connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.
2.  Located in Egypt.
3.  The shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.
4.  Recently saw a shift in India's fuel exports to Europe, with routes diverting to the Cape of Good Hope.
5.  A vital waterway for global trade.


Which waterway is being described?

(a) Strait of Malacca
(b) Panama Canal
(c) Suez Canal
(d) Strait of Hormuz


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description clearly refers to the Suez Canal.  The Strait of Malacca, Panama Canal, and Strait of Hormuz are all significant waterways, but none of them completely match the features listed. The detail about the shift in India's fuel export routes due to geopolitical factors adds a layer of complexity and requires up-to-date knowledge of current affairs.


**5. Consider the following statements about an island nation:**

1.  Located in the Indian Ocean.
2.  East of Madagascar.
3.  Off the southeastern coast of Africa.
4.  Home to India's first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra (JAK).
5.  Neighboring islands include Reunion Island (France) and the Seychelles.

Which island nation is described?

(a) Sri Lanka
(b) Mauritius
(c) Maldives
(d) Comoros


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description points to Mauritius.  While other Indian Ocean island nations share some characteristics, the combination of geographic location, proximity to Madagascar and the Seychelles, and the specific mention of the Jan Aushadhi Kendra uniquely identifies Mauritius.  The inclusion of neighboring islands adds another level of specificity, making it a challenging question requiring detailed knowledge of the region's geography and recent developments.


**6. Consider the following features of a landlocked African country:**

1.  Located in Central Africa.
2.  Borders Uganda, Tanzania, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

5.  Capital city is Kigali.

Which country is described?

(a) Zambia
(b) Rwanda
(c) Angola
(d) Malawi


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description fits Rwanda perfectly.  While other landlocked African countries may share some bordering countries, the combination of its location in Central Africa, bordering Lake Kivu, the recent news about UK asylum policy, and its capital city, Kigali, specifically identifies Rwanda.  The precise combination of geographical and political details makes this question challenging.


**7. Consider the following regarding a country in West Africa:**

1.  Borders Ghana, Benin, and Burkina Faso.

(b) Togo
(c) Ivory Coast
(d) Nigeria


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The description accurately depicts Togo. The other options, while located in West Africa, do not match all the given characteristics. The specific mention of bordering countries and the Gulf of Guinea, combined with the recent diplomatic engagement with India, makes it a challenging question requiring specific knowledge of West African geography and current affairs.


**8. Consider the following about a country in Southern Africa:**

1.  Landlocked.
2.  Borders Zambia, Tanzania, and Mozambique.
3.  Has a long border with Lake Malawi (Lake Nyasa).

5.  India established diplomatic relations with this country shortly after its independence in 1964.

Which country is described?

(a) Zimbabwe
(b) Botswana
(c) Malawi
(d) Lesotho

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The description precisely describes Malawi. While other landlocked Southern African countries exist, only Malawi fits all the criteria.  The inclusion of the date of India establishing diplomatic relations adds a layer of difficulty, requiring knowledge of historical events.  The other options are incorrect because they do not fulfill all the mentioned geographical and historical conditions.


**9.  Consider the following statements related to a specific geographical area:**

1.  A disputed territory between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
2.  Officially recognized as part of Azerbaijan.
3.  Known as Artsakh by Armenians.
4.  A landlocked mountainous region.
5.  Recently saw the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers following Azerbaijan's recapture of territory.

Which region is described?

(a) South Ossetia
(b) Abkhazia
(c) Nagorno-Karabakh
(d) Transnistria


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The statements clearly describe Nagorno-Karabakh.  The other options, while also conflict zones, do not match all the given features.  The question requires knowledge of the ongoing conflicts in the Caucasus region and the recent developments concerning Nagorno-Karabakh.  The specific mention of the withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers makes it a more challenging question.



**10. Consider the following features of a major river:**

1.  Longest river in the world.
2.  Flows through 11 countries.
3.  Its Blue Nile tributary originates from Lake Tana in Ethiopia.
4.  The Blue Nile contributes the majority of its water, particularly during the rainy season.
5.  Important tributaries include the Sobat and Atbara Rivers.

Which river is described?

(a) Amazon River
(b) Yangtze River
(c) Nile River
(d) Mississippi River

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The description refers to the Nile River. While other major rivers exist, only the Nile matches all the features listed, particularly the origin of its Blue Nile tributary and the contribution of that tributary to the river's overall water volume. The statement about the number of countries it traverses also helps to pinpoint the correct answer. The inclusion of specific tributaries further clarifies the identification.  The other options are easily eliminated as they do not match all aspects of the given description.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the precise location. While it's broadly in the stated regions, the phrasing is slightly off. Statement 2 is incorrect, as Lake Turkana is Africa's fourth-largest lake. Statement 3 is correct; the Omo River is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.

Statement 3 is correct. The text highlights India's role in facilitating the African Union's inclusion in the G20, reflecting its efforts to promote inclusivity and representation of the Global South in major international forums.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  The text mentions Aarogya Maitri as a mission for health *security* which implies international collaboration and global health concerns, rather than being solely focused on domestic infrastructure.  The phrasing "One World-One Health" suggests a global perspective.


9. Consider the following statements regarding the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI):

1. IPOI is a treaty-based arrangement promoting cooperation for a free and open Indo-Pacific.
2. IPOI was launched by India in 2019 at the East Asia Summit in Bangkok.
3. IPOI builds upon India's 'Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR)' initiative.
4. IPOI primarily focuses on military alliances and security partnerships.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the IPOI?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly identifies India as the launcher of IPOI in 2019 at the EAS in Bangkok.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly links IPOI to India's SAGAR initiative, demonstrating its continuity and evolution of India's Indo-Pacific strategy.

Statement 4 is incorrect. While security is a component, IPOI's scope is broader than just military alliances.  The text emphasizes cooperation for a free and open Indo-Pacific, which includes economic and environmental aspects.


10. Consider the following about the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA):

1. EFTA is a customs union similar to the European Union (EU).
2.  Three EFTA members participate in the European Economic Area (EEA), granting access to the EU's single market.
3.  The India-EFTA TEPA aims to reduce trade barriers between India and EFTA members.

Statement 2 is correct. The text correctly points out that three EFTA members participate in the EEA, granting them access to the EU's single market.

Statement 3 is correct.  The purpose of the TEPA is to facilitate trade by reducing trade barriers between India and the EFTA member states.

Statement 4 is incorrect.  Since EFTA is not a customs union, it does not have a common external tariff.  Each member country maintains its own external tariffs for countries outside the association, as the text explains.


**1. Consider the following features of international economic cooperation initiatives:**

1.  A blockchain-based payment system aiming to provide an alternative to SWIFT for member nations.
2.  An initiative focused on creating a fair and equitable trading system for agricultural products, enhancing food security within the participating countries.

5.  A leaders-led forum for dialogue on strategic, political, and economic issues involving ASEAN nations and other partners.

How many of the above features describe initiatives directly involving India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The features describe several India-focused initiatives.  Let's analyze each:

1. **BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay:** This is a blockchain-based payment system designed for BRICS nations, and India is a member of BRICS. Therefore, this feature accurately describes an initiative involving India.

2. **BRICS Grain Exchange:**  This initiative is explicitly focused on improving agricultural trade within the BRICS community.  As India is a member of BRICS, it is directly involved.

3. **ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**  The description clearly states that this agreement aims to improve trade relations between ASEAN nations and India, making it a relevant India-focused initiative.

4. **International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):** The INSTC is a multi-modal transport network that explicitly connects India to Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.  India's direct participation is a key component of this initiative.

5. **East Asia Summit (EAS):** While the EAS involves ASEAN and several other nations, the text explicitly mentions India's participation, making it an initiative where India plays a direct role.

Therefore, all four of the first four statements accurately reflect initiatives directly involving India.  The correct answer is (d).


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with international economic organizations and agreements:**

1.  India has a trade surplus with the ASEAN bloc.
2.  India's largest trading partner bloc is the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
3.  India contributes to a fund accelerating Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in developing nations.
4.  India maintains strategic partnerships with all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
5.  India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of a specific port.


How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Let's assess the accuracy of each statement:

1. **Incorrect:** The provided text states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus.

2. **Correct:** The text explicitly states that the GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc.

3. **Correct:** India's contribution to the Social Impact Fund for accelerating DPI in the Global South is explicitly mentioned in the provided text.

4. **Incorrect:** While India has strategic partnerships with some GCC members (Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Oman are mentioned), the text doesn't explicitly confirm strategic partnerships with *all* GCC members.

5. **Correct:** The text details India's tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port.

Therefore, three of the statements are factually accurate. The correct answer is (c).


**3. Consider the following aspects of India's foreign policy and economic initiatives:**

1.  The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) is a treaty-based arrangement.
2.  The G4 nations advocate for UN Security Council reform through text-based negotiations.
3.  India was a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum.
4.  The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) bypasses the Suez Canal.
5.  The  "Vision of Aarogya Maitri" initiative focuses on promoting digital public infrastructure.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Let's evaluate the accuracy of each statement:

1. **Incorrect:** The text explicitly states that IPOI is a *non*-treaty-based voluntary arrangement.

2. **Correct:** The provided text confirms that the G4 nations are committed to UN Security Council reform via text-based negotiations.

3. **Correct:** The text states that India is a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum.

4. **Incorrect:** While the INSTC provides an alternative route, the text does not state that it completely bypasses the Suez Canal.  It offers an alternative, not a complete avoidance.

5. **Incorrect:**  "Vision of Aarogya Maitri" focuses on health security, not specifically digital public infrastructure (DPI).  The DPI initiative is a separate mention.

Therefore, only two statements are entirely correct.  The correct answer is (b).


**4. Consider the following organizations and their activities:**

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a program focused on using nuclear techniques to improve food security.
2. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released a global cybersecurity index in 2024.

How many of these statements are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Let's examine the accuracy of each statement:

1. **Incorrect:**  India elevated its relationship with Vietnam to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2016, not 2007.  It was initially a "Strategic Partnership" in 2007.

2. **Correct:** The text correctly states that India and Malaysia established an "Enhanced Strategic Partnership" in 2015.

3. **Incorrect:** The India-US Trade Policy Forum was established in 2005, not 2018.

4. **Correct:** The text states that India has a trade surplus with the US.

5. **Correct:** The signing of BECA between India and the US in 2020 is accurately mentioned.

Three statements are correct.  The correct answer is (c).


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on international relations, organizations, and events.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks nuclear material theft incidents within member states.
2. The Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear technology to enhance agricultural productivity and food security globally.
3. The Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes the use of nuclear energy as a means to achieve net-zero carbon emissions.
4. The IAEA's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles focuses solely on developing safer nuclear reactor designs.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 and 3 are accurate reflections of the IAEA's programs. Atoms4Food directly addresses food security challenges using nuclear techniques in agriculture, while Atoms4NetZero aims to leverage nuclear energy for climate change mitigation.  Statement 1 is incorrect because, while the ITDB tracks illicit nuclear trafficking, it doesn't limit itself to only member states; incidents involving nuclear material theft are recorded globally. Statement 4 is also incorrect because, while the IAEA's project focuses on innovation, its scope extends beyond merely improving safety; it also explores new reactor technologies and fuel cycles for improved efficiency and sustainability.


**2. Consider the following regarding the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses national cybersecurity capabilities across five key pillars.
2.  India was categorized as a "role-modeling" country in the GCI 2024, indicating a high level of cybersecurity commitment.
3. The majority of countries assessed in the GCI 2024 were classified as having "established" or "evolving" cybersecurity infrastructures.
4. The GCI 2024 focuses exclusively on the technological aspects of cybersecurity, neglecting governance and policy considerations.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe key aspects of the ITU's GCI 2024.  The index indeed evaluates cybersecurity across multiple pillars, including technological capabilities, legal frameworks, and institutional capacity. India's inclusion in the "role-modeling" tier highlights its strong commitment to these areas. The report also indicated that many countries were still in the process of developing their cybersecurity infrastructure. Statement 4 is incorrect; the GCI 2024 is a holistic assessment that incorporates various aspects of cybersecurity, including governance and policy.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Kargil War and its aftermath:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar was a naval operation conducted by the Indian Navy to blockade Pakistani ports.
2. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam and focused solely on military strategies.
3. Operation Talwar was an air operation undertaken by the Indian Air Force to target Pakistani positions in high-altitude areas.
4.  The Kargil War primarily focused on the areas of Tololing, Tiger Hill, Batalik, Drass, Mushkoh Valley, Kaksar, and Chorbat La.

How many of the statements above are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  Operation Talwar was indeed an air operation conducted by the Indian Air Force targeting Pakistani positions at high altitudes, and the listed locations were all key battlegrounds during the Kargil conflict. Statement 1 is incorrect; Operation Safed Sagar was an air operation, not a naval one.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; while K. Subrahmanyam chaired the KRC, its scope extended beyond purely military aspects; it also examined intelligence gathering, political and diplomatic strategies, and overall national security architecture improvements.


**4. Consider the following about the weaponization and militarization of space:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits all forms of military activity in outer space.
2.  Russia's veto of the UNSC resolution on a weapon-free outer space was based on the argument that the resolution only addressed weapons of mass destruction.
3. Weaponization of space refers to the deployment of weapons in space, while militarization of space refers to the use of space for supporting military operations without deploying weapons.
4.  The United States and Japan jointly proposed the vetoed UNSC resolution aiming to completely ban all military activity in outer space.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 correctly reflect the nuances of space weaponization and militarization. Russia's veto was indeed based on the argument that the resolution lacked comprehensive consideration of all potential space weapons. The distinction between weaponization (deploying weapons) and militarization (using space for military support) is also accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; the 1967 treaty prohibits weapons of mass destruction in orbit but doesn't fully ban all military activities. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the US and Japan proposed the resolution, it focused on WMDs, not a complete ban on all military uses of space.


**5. Consider the following regarding the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF):**

1.  India's participation in CMF began in 2023.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first operation undertaken by the Indian Navy under CMF.
3. The CMF is a multinational task force primarily focused on combating piracy and drug trafficking in the Arabian Sea.
4. The CMF's operations are limited to the Arabian Sea and do not extend to other regions.


Which of the above statements is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda marked India's first operation within the CMF framework following its 2022 accession. The CMF is known for its efforts to counter piracy and drug smuggling, particularly in the Arabian Sea.  Statement 1 is incorrect; India joined CMF in 2022, not 2023. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the Arabian Sea is a key operational area, the CMF's activities are not limited to that region.



**6. Consider the following statements concerning the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2023.
2.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter was the final step in bringing the charter into effect.
3. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is one of its major projects.
4.  The BIMSTEC's principles include sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and non-interference in internal affairs.


Which of the following statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2, 3, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe aspects of BIMSTEC. Nepal's ratification was indeed the final step, and the transport connectivity plan is a significant initiative.  The principles mentioned are core tenets of the organization.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the charter came into effect in 2024, not 2023.

1.  The “Strengthening the Quad Act” was passed by the US Senate.
2. The Quad Leaders’ Summit in Wilmington adopted the Wilmington Declaration.
3. The Wilmington Declaration included a partnership to combat cervical cancer, termed the "Quad Cancer Moonshot".
4. The "Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)" was announced as part of the Wilmington Declaration.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. The Wilmington Declaration was indeed adopted, and the initiatives to combat cervical cancer and enhance maritime training were announced. Statement 1 is incorrect; the "Strengthening the Quad Act" was passed by the US House of Representatives, not the Senate.


**8. Consider the following regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and drug trafficking.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004.
4. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct.  The FATF's MER does assess measures against money laundering, and the dates of establishment for the FIU-IND and ED are accurate.  The 2010 date for India's first MER is also correct.



**9. Consider the following regarding the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identified cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
2. The "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) is highlighted as a region with significant drug trafficking issues.
3.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.
4. The "Golden Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) and the "Golden Crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) are identified as regions with significant drug production.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Cannabis was identified as the most widely abused drug, the Triple Frontier Area's significance in drug trafficking is noted, and the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent are highlighted for drug production. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UNODC's report on wildlife crime has a global scope, not limited only to Africa.


**10. Consider the following statements about international exercises involving the Indian Navy:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa.
2. RIMPAC is the world's largest international maritime exercise.
3. Exercise Cutlass Express is led by the US Naval Forces and involves only nations in the Indian Ocean Region.
4. Exercise Orion involves participation from India, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Spain, and the United States of America.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate descriptions of the respective naval exercises. IBSAMAR involves the three named countries, RIMPAC is the world's largest, and Exercise Orion involves the listed nations.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while the US leads Cutlass Express, its participation isn't limited to the Indian Ocean Region.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal
4. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
5. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED)

How many of the above are Indian legislative frameworks or institutions primarily involved in combating money laundering and terrorist financing?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are key legislative frameworks in India designed to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The PMLA provides the legal basis for investigating and prosecuting money laundering offenses, while the UAPA deals with unlawful activities, including those with links to terrorism, which often involve money laundering.  The FIU-IND is the central national agency responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.  The ED is a key enforcement agency under the PMLA, tasked with investigating and prosecuting financial crimes.  The MLAT Portal facilitates international cooperation in combating these crimes. Therefore, four of the listed items are directly involved in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  While the MLAT Portal aids in this effort, it is a mechanism of cooperation, not a legislative framework or institution in itself.


**2. Consider the following:**

1.  The Geneva Protocol of 1925
2.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
3.  The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972
4.  The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)

How many of the above international agreements directly address the prohibition or regulation of chemical or biological weapons?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993 comprehensively bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC) establishes a court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, which *may* include the use of chemical or biological weapons, but it does not directly regulate their production or stockpiling.  Therefore, three of the listed agreements directly address the prohibition or regulation of chemical or biological weapons.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle)
2.  The Golden Crescent (now Death Crescent)
3.  The Triple Frontier Area
4.  The Caribbean Basin

Which of the above regions are historically or currently significant areas for the production or trafficking of illicit drugs?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) and the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) are well-known regions historically associated with significant opium and heroin production and trafficking.  The Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) is a region known for its porous borders and involvement in drug trafficking, money laundering, and other illicit activities. While the Caribbean Basin has been involved in drug trafficking, its significance is not as historically prominent or consistently high as the other three regions listed, compared to the persistent issues in the Golden Triangle, Golden Crescent, and the Triple Frontier Area. Therefore, the Golden Triangle, Golden Crescent, and Triple Frontier Area are all historically or currently significant regions for illicit drug production or trafficking.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  It conducts peer reviews of countries' measures to combat money laundering.
2.  It produces Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assessing countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts.
3.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
4.  The FATF is a specialized agency of the United Nations.

How many of the above statements about the FATF are accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF conducts peer reviews and produces Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) that assess countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010. However, the FATF is *not* a specialized agency of the United Nations; it is an inter-governmental organization.  Therefore, three of the four statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following international organizations:**

1.  The Universal Postal Union (UPU)
2.  The Five Eyes Alliance
3.  The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)
4.  The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+)
5.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)

How many of the above are intergovernmental organizations focused on areas other than military or security cooperation?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UPU focuses on postal services, the WSIS on information and communication technologies, and the AIIB on infrastructure development. OPEC+ is focused on the coordination of oil production policies.  The Five Eyes Alliance is primarily a military and intelligence-sharing alliance. Therefore, four of the listed organizations focus on areas outside of military or security cooperation.


**6. Consider the following:**

1.  The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
2.  The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)
3.  The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network
4.  The South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)

How many of the above are international bodies involved in combating transnational organized crime, corruption, or related illicit activities?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The INCB monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties. The CCPCJ addresses crime prevention and criminal justice issues, including transnational organized crime. GlobE focuses on anti-corruption efforts. SAWEN works to combat wildlife crime in South Asia. All four organizations are involved in combating transnational organized crime, corruption, or related illicit activities in their respective mandates.


**7. Consider the following regarding the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1.  It was established in 2022.
2.  Its charter came into force in May 2024.
3.  It includes a Master Plan for Transport Connectivity.
4.  It focuses on seven key areas, including trade, environment, security, and agriculture.
5.  It is primarily a military alliance.

How many of the above statements accurately describe BIMSTEC?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the BIMSTEC charter was adopted in 2022 during the 5th summit, the organization itself was established earlier. The charter's coming into force in May 2024 is accurate.  BIMSTEC indeed has a Master Plan for Transport Connectivity and focuses on seven key areas, including trade, the environment, security, and agriculture. However, BIMSTEC is not primarily a military alliance; it's a regional organization for multi-sectoral technical and economic cooperation. Therefore, four of the statements accurately describe BIMSTEC.


**8. Consider the following related to India's engagement with international organizations:**

1.  India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
2.  India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.
3.  India was the highest contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.
4.  India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's involvement in international cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately reflect aspects of India's involvement in international cooperation. India is a signatory to the CWC and has enacted related legislation.  India has been a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping operations, and it is a member of SAWEN.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding international efforts to combat illicit activities:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts peer reviews of countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs).
2. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights the most abused drugs globally and the regions most affected by drug abuse.
3. The Palermo Convention, supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, is a key mechanism to tackle transnational organized crime.
4.  The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network focuses solely on preventing cybercrime.

How many of the above statements are entirely accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate. The FATF indeed uses MERs for peer reviews, the UNODC report focuses on drug abuse trends, and the Palermo Convention is a crucial tool against transnational organized crime.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. While GlobE addresses corruption, it doesn't exclusively focus on cybercrime; its scope is broader, encompassing various forms of corruption.  Therefore, only three statements are entirely correct.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's engagement with international organizations:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India's Department of Posts issued commemorative stamps for the 150th anniversary of the Universal Postal Union (UPU).

However, statement 4 is incorrect. India's contribution to the Commonwealth is multifaceted, encompassing population representation, financial contributions, and hosting significant events, not solely military deployment.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following about international conventions and treaties related to weapons:**

1. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in armed conflict.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapon stockpiles within a set timeframe by its member states.
3. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) allows for the limited production of biological weapons for research purposes under strict international oversight.
4. The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to primarily prosecute individuals involved in financial crimes.


Which of the above statements accurately describe these international agreements?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 correctly describe the Geneva Protocol and the CWC. The Geneva Protocol bans the use of chemical and biological weapons, and the CWC requires the destruction of stockpiles. Statement 3 is incorrect; the BWC prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, with no exceptions for research.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; the ICC primarily prosecutes war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, not financial crimes. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's domestic legislation and international commitments:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002 is a key legislative framework in India's fight against money laundering.
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) of 1967 primarily addresses issues related to environmental protection.

Which of the statements correctly reflect India's legal and policy framework?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4
(d) All of the above


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The PMLA is crucial for anti-money laundering efforts, and the Chemical Weapons Convention Act ensures compliance with the international CWC.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the UAPA deals with unlawful activities, including terrorism, not environmental issues.  Statement 4 is also incorrect; while the MLAT Portal aids international cooperation, its primary focus is broader than just drug trafficking; it encompasses various forms of cross-border criminal activities. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are accurate.


**5. Consider the following regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its activities:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear weapons theft.

How many of the above statements accurately describe G7 initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 4 accurately reflect G7 initiatives. The PGII indeed seeks funding for sustainable infrastructure, and the Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to stabilize oil prices. Statement 2 is incorrect; the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on *clean* energy, not fossil fuels. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the FSOI addresses a broader range of ocean-related issues, not just fishing. Therefore, only two statements are accurate.


**1. Consider the following conflict-affected areas:**

1. Tigray (Ethiopia)
2. Mindanao (Philippines)
3. Western Sahara
4. Kachin State (Myanmar)
5. Sahel Region (Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger)

How many of the above areas are characterized by conflicts primarily driven by ethnic tensions and resource control?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Tigray (Ethiopia) is primarily driven by a political power struggle and demands for autonomy, though ethnic tensions play a role. Mindanao (Philippines) involves autonomy demands, Islamic governance issues, and extremism, with ethnic tensions as a contributing factor. Western Sahara is a classic independence dispute over territory, with ethnic aspects interwoven. Kachin State (Myanmar) is primarily about ethnic autonomy and resource control. The Sahel region experiences insurgency, ethnic tensions, and weak governance, making ethnic tensions and resource control major drivers. Therefore, three of the listed areas – Mindanao, Kachin State, and the Sahel region – are characterized by conflicts primarily driven by ethnic tensions and resource control.  The other options are incorrect because they fail to accurately reflect the primary drivers of conflict in each region.


**2. Consider the following statements about international organizations:**

1. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) maintains a database on nuclear material theft.
2. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.

The IAEA does indeed track incidents of nuclear material theft through its Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB). The ITU is responsible for releasing the GCI. The FATF’s core function involves evaluating countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures.  The UPU is a UN specialized agency focusing on postal services. Therefore, all four statements are correct, making (d) the appropriate answer.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the statements.


**3. Consider the following conflict-affected regions:**

1. Nagorno-Karabakh
2. Chechnya
3. Transnistria
4. South Ossetia and Abkhazia
5. Basque Country

How many of these regions have experienced conflicts stemming from separatist movements seeking independence or greater autonomy?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Nagorno-Karabakh has seen a long-running conflict between Armenian separatists and Azerbaijan. Chechnya has witnessed multiple separatist conflicts against Russia. Transnistria is a self-declared independent republic within Moldova. South Ossetia and Abkhazia are regions within Georgia that declared independence and are supported by Russia. The Basque Country's conflict involves a separatist movement seeking independence from Spain.  Therefore, all five regions listed have experienced conflicts directly related to separatist movements, making (d) the correct answer.  Each region represents a distinct case of a separatist movement causing conflict.


**4. Consider the following international agreements or conventions:**

1. The Geneva Protocol of 1925
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)
3. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972
4. The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC)

How many of these agreements directly address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction or related warfare?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. The CWC bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The Rome Statute establishes the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but not specifically focusing on the weapons themselves. Thus, three of the listed agreements directly address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction or related warfare. Option (d) is incorrect because while the Rome Statute is relevant to the consequences of using such weapons, it is not directly focused on their prohibition or regulation.


**5. Consider the following concerning India's foreign relations:**

1. India and Bangladesh share a significant trade relationship.
2. India and Maldives have signed a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA).
3. India participates in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.
4. India has launched RuPay cards in Mauritius.

How many of these statements accurately describe aspects of India's recent foreign policy engagements?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly reflect aspects of India's foreign relations. India and Bangladesh are major trading partners in South Asia.  A CSA between India and the Maldives is mentioned. India's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a known fact.  The launch of RuPay cards in Mauritius is also a recent development. Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all four statements are accurate representations of India's recent foreign policy activities.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present.


**6. Consider the following regarding geographically dispersed conflicts:**

1.  The Patani conflict in Southern Thailand involves Malay-Muslim separatists.
2.  The conflict in West Papua involves an independence movement against Indonesia.
3.  The conflict in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, is fueled by an Islamist insurgency.
4.  The conflict in the Kursk region is primarily between Russia and Ukraine.

How many of the above correctly identify the primary factions or drivers of conflict in the specified regions?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

The Patani conflict in Southern Thailand is indeed driven by Malay-Muslim separatists seeking autonomy.  West Papua's conflict centers on an independence movement against Indonesian rule. Cabo Delgado, Mozambique, is experiencing a significant Islamist insurgency. However, while the Kursk region has seen conflict related to the broader Russia-Ukraine war, it's not the primary driver of conflict in that specific region; other factors like border disputes and military actions are also heavily involved. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately identify the primary factions or drivers, making (c) the correct answer.  The description of the Kursk conflict as primarily between Russia and Ukraine is an oversimplification.


**7. Consider the following features of the Maldives:**

1. It is composed of natural atolls.
2. It is located in the Atlantic Ocean.
3. It borders Sri Lanka.
4. It is a landlocked country.

How many of the above statements are correct regarding the geographical features of the Maldives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Maldives are indeed composed of natural atolls. However, the Maldives are located in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. It does not border Sri Lanka;  significant distance separates them.  The Maldives are an island nation, not a landlocked country.  Therefore, only one statement – that the Maldives are composed of natural atolls – is correct, making (a) the correct answer. The other options present inaccurate or misleading geographical descriptions of the Maldives.


**8. Consider the following statements concerning international energy cooperation:**

1. The TAPI pipeline transports natural gas.
2. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a significant energy infrastructure project.
3.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports crude oil.
4. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are located in Bhutan.

How many of the above statements correctly describe energy infrastructure projects or initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The TAPI pipeline is indeed designed to transport natural gas. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a real project, enhancing energy connectivity.  However, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports refined petroleum products like diesel and kerosene, not crude oil. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are located in Nepal, not Bhutan.  Therefore, only two statements accurately describe energy infrastructure projects, making (b) the correct answer.  The incorrect statements contain factual errors concerning the type of product transported and the location of the hydropower projects.

How many of the above statements correctly identify a water body bordering the specified country?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Rwanda does indeed border Lake Kivu. Togo correctly borders the Gulf of Guinea. The DRC borders the Atlantic Ocean. However, Mauritius is located in the Indian Ocean, not the Pacific Ocean.  Therefore, three statements accurately identify a water body bordering the specified country, making (c) the correct answer.  The incorrect statement contains a factual error regarding the ocean bordering Mauritius.


**10. Consider the following concerning the regions affected by conflict:**

1. The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are disputed between Japan and China.
2. Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the United Arab Emirates.
3. The Gulf of Aden has experienced pirate attacks.
4. Somalia borders the Red Sea.

How many of the above statements correctly identify a region or location with ongoing territorial disputes or security challenges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are a source of territorial tension between Japan and China. Abu Musa Island is indeed claimed by both Iran and the UAE. The Gulf of Aden has experienced pirate attacks. However, Somalia borders the Indian Ocean, not the Red Sea. Therefore, three statements correctly identify regions or locations with ongoing disputes or security challenges, making (c) the correct answer. The incorrect statement contains a factual error regarding Somalia's bordering water body.

Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions focus more on factual recall and analysis, while others touch upon application and conceptual understanding. The difficulty is achieved through the inclusion of closely related but ultimately incorrect distractors and the requirement for precise knowledge of specific details.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal launched in 2022
4. The establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) in 2004
5. The establishment of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) in 1956

How many of the above are Indian measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as assessed by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  All five elements listed are integral parts of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing framework. The PMLA and UAPA provide the legal framework, while the MLAT portal enhances international cooperation. The FIU-IND and ED are key institutions responsible for investigation and enforcement.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the comprehensive nature of India's approach as reflected in the FATF's assessment.  The question's difficulty stems from the need to recall specific details about the establishment dates of institutions and the launch date of the MLAT portal, alongside understanding the broader context of FATF evaluations.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. The Simla Convention of 1914
2. The Johnson Line of 1865
3. The McMahon Line
4. The McDonald Line of 1899

How many of the above are directly related to the demarcation or claims concerning the Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China in the Western Sector (Ladakh)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The LAC in the Western Sector is a highly disputed area.  The Johnson Line represents India's claim, while the McDonald Line reflects China's claim. The McMahon Line is relevant to the Eastern Sector, not the Western Sector. The Simla Convention, while historically significant to the region, doesn't directly define the current LAC claims in the Western Sector.  Therefore, three of the listed elements (the Johnson Line, the McDonald Line, and the historical context of the Simla Convention which underpins the present claims) are directly related to the LAC dispute in the Western Sector. The inclusion of the McMahon Line as a distractor increases the question's difficulty, requiring precise knowledge of the geographical specifics of the India-China border dispute.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
2.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)
3.  The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition
4. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
5. Apulia Food Systems initiative

How many of the above are initiatives primarily led or significantly supported by the G7 group of nations?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Four
(d) Five

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four of the listed initiatives ("Energy for Growth in Africa," FSOI, the Oil Price Cap Coalition, and PGII) are either directly led by or have significant G7 support. Apulia Food Systems, while dealing with food security, is not explicitly mentioned as a G7-led initiative in the provided text. Therefore, the correct answer is (c). This question tests the ability to identify and differentiate between various international initiatives and their key sponsors, requiring careful attention to detail and an understanding of G7's role in global affairs. The inclusion of Apulia Food Systems as a plausible distractor increases the difficulty.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The Kurichu Hydroelectric Project
2.  The Tala Hydroelectric Project

5. The Teesta River

How many of the above are related to India-Bhutan bilateral energy cooperation projects?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** The text explicitly mentions the Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydroelectric projects as examples of India-Bhutan energy cooperation. The Teesta River, while relevant to the region's hydroelectricity potential, is not specifically named as a project within the context of India-Bhutan cooperation. Therefore, four of the elements are directly linked to the specified bilateral energy projects.  The inclusion of the Teesta River as a closely related but incorrect option enhances the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  The 8-Degree Channel
2.  The 9-Degree Channel
3.  The 10-Degree Channel
4. The Chagos Archipelago

How many of the above are channels or water bodies geographically relevant to the Maldives or its immediate vicinity?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The 8-Degree, 9-Degree, and 10-Degree Channels are explicitly mentioned in relation to the Maldives' geographic location and its proximity to other island groups. The Chagos Archipelago, while located in the Indian Ocean, is not directly mentioned in the context of the Maldives.  Therefore, three of the listed elements are geographically relevant to the Maldives, making (c) the correct answer. The question tests the ability to recall specific geographical details and differentiate between closely related water bodies.  The inclusion of the Chagos Archipelago as a plausible distractor increases the difficulty level.


1. Consider the following initiatives related to global infrastructure and investment:

1.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)
4.  The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition
5.  Apulia Food Systems initiative

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Only two.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative explicitly aims to facilitate clean energy investment in Africa.  The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition, while not directly about energy *production*, focuses on managing global energy prices, a crucial aspect of energy security and stability.  The PGII, FSOI, and Apulia Food Systems initiatives, while potentially indirectly related to energy (e.g., infrastructure supporting energy projects), are not primarily focused on energy challenges.  The PGII focuses broadly on sustainable infrastructure, and the FSOI and Apulia Food Systems are dedicated to ocean sustainability and food security respectively. Therefore, only two initiatives directly address energy-related issues.


2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM):

1.  NAM advocates for the removal of Cuba from the US's unilateral list of state sponsors of terrorism.

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Less than three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Only four. Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe aspects of the NAM and the US's state sponsor of terrorism list. Statement 1 correctly notes NAM's advocacy for Cuba's removal. Statement 2 accurately describes the consequences of being on the list. Statement 3 correctly lists other countries included.  Statement 4 correctly highlights NAM's significance to the Global South.  However, statement 5 is incorrect; while consensus is important in NAM, the decision-making process isn't solely based on unanimity.  Therefore, only four statements are fully accurate.

4. Consider the following UN-related entities and their activities:

1.  The United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) publishes an annual economic survey.
2.  The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) celebrated its 60th anniversary.
3.  UNCTAD's key reports include the Trade & Development Report and the World Investment Report.
4.  The UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) addresses supply chain disruptions.
5.  The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) advocate for UN Security Council reform.

How many of these statements correctly identify UN-related entities or initiatives and their functions or objectives?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Less than three


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately describe UN-related entities or their activities. UNESCAP's annual publication is a well-known fact. UNCTAD's anniversary and key reports are also accurate. The UN-GSCF's focus on supply chain issues is correct.  The G4 nations' advocacy for Security Council reform is also accurate.  Therefore, all five statements are correct.


5. Consider the following about the India-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):

1. India is a Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2. IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement includes a Crisis Response Network.
3. IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement includes a Labor Rights Advisory Board.
4. IPEF aims to reduce trade barriers between India and its partner countries.
5. IPEF is primarily focused on infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of the IPEF and its Supply Chain Agreement?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Only four. Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe elements of the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement. Statement 4 is also largely correct; while IPEF's scope is broader than just reducing trade barriers, it is a significant component of the framework. However, statement 5 is incorrect; IPEF's focus is not primarily on infrastructure, though infrastructure development might be a component of its broader economic and trade objectives.  Therefore, only four statements accurately reflect the IPEF.


6. Consider the following about the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):

1. IMEC aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
2. IMEC is expected to be a significant contributor to global connectivity.
3. IMEC is primarily focused on promoting tourism between the three regions.
4. IMEC's development is being spearheaded solely by India.
5. IMEC's primary goal is to reduce reliance on existing global trade routes.

How many of the statements correctly describe aspects of the IMEC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) More than three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only two statements accurately reflect aspects of the IMEC. Statement 1 correctly identifies its aim to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe. Statement 2 correctly notes its potential contribution to global connectivity. Statement 3 is incorrect; while tourism might benefit, it's not the primary focus. Statement 4 is incorrect; IMEC's development involves multiple stakeholders. Statement 5 is incorrect; reducing reliance on existing routes is not its primary stated goal, though it might have that effect indirectly.  Thus, only two statements are accurate.


7. Consider the following regarding the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):

1. Belarus recently joined the SCO.
2. The SCO focuses on counter-terrorism and anti-drug strategies.
3. The SCO's 24th summit was held in Astana, Kazakhstan.

5. The SCO has a strong military alliance component.


How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of the SCO?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Only three. Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect aspects of the SCO: Belarus's accession, its counter-terrorism and anti-drug focus, and the location of its 24th summit. However, statement 4 is inaccurate; while economic cooperation is a part of the SCO's agenda, it's not the primary focus; security and regional stability are paramount.  Statement 5 is also inaccurate; the SCO is not primarily a military alliance, although security cooperation is a key component.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


8. Consider the following about the Group of Seven (G7):

1.  The G7 operates on a rotating presidency system.
2.  The G7 has a permanent, fixed organizational structure.
3.  The G7 includes the European Union as a member.
4.  The G7 launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).
5.  The G7's primary focus is on environmental protection.

How many of these statements accurately reflect characteristics of the G7?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) More than three


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) Only three. Statements 1, 3, and 4 are accurate. The G7 does have a rotating presidency, the EU participates as a member, and the PGII was indeed a G7 initiative. Statement 2 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while environmental issues are addressed, they are not the *primary* focus of the G7; economic and security issues are also central. Therefore, only three statements are correct.


9. Consider the following about the “Uniting for Consensus” (UfC) group:

1. The UfC opposes the G4 nations' bid for permanent UN Security Council seats.
2. The UfC includes countries like Argentina, Canada, and Mexico.
3. The UfC is also known as the "Coffee Club."

How many of the statements correctly describe aspects of the UfC?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Only three. Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the UfC: its opposition to the G4's bid, its membership including the mentioned countries, and its alternative name. Statement 4 is incorrect; the UfC opposes the G4's proposal for *permanent* seats, not expansion in general. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the UfC's primary focus is on UN Security Council reform, not economic development.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


10. Consider the following regarding the International Criminal Court (ICC):

1. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Russia's president.
2. The ICC's arrest warrants are legally binding on all UN member states.
3. The ICC can issue arrest warrants for crimes against humanity and war crimes.
4. The ICC's jurisdiction is limited to cases involving state-sponsored terrorism.
5. The ICC is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Security Council.

How many of these statements correctly describe aspects of the ICC and its functions?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) Only three. Statements 1, 3, and 2 are correct. The ICC did issue a warrant for the Russian president, it can issue warrants for the crimes mentioned, and its warrants are binding on member states that have ratified the Rome Statute.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the ICC's jurisdiction is broader than state-sponsored terrorism. Statement 5 is also incorrect; the ICC is an independent international organization, not a UN subsidiary. Therefore, only three statements are accurate.




1. Consider the following statements regarding the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII):

1. It was launched in 2021 with the primary goal of fostering sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries.
2. It aims to mobilize a total of $500 billion by 2025, focusing on projects related to renewable energy and digital connectivity.
3.  The initiative is primarily led by the G7 nations, with significant contributions from other developed countries.
4.  It emphasizes the importance of inclusive growth, ensuring that the benefits of infrastructure projects reach marginalized communities.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021.  The year is a crucial detail. While the goal is sustainable infrastructure in developing nations, the precise launch date is important for understanding its timeline and progress.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not $500 billion by 2025. The discrepancy in funding target and timeline is a significant difference that demonstrates a lack of precise understanding of the initiative.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The PGII is a G7-led initiative, but it also seeks broader participation and contributions from various countries and organizations.  The exclusive mention of G7 nations oversimplifies the initiative's complex international collaborations.

Statement 4 is correct. The PGII emphasizes inclusive growth, ensuring that infrastructure projects benefit marginalized communities.  This focus on social equity is a key aspect of the initiative's goals and implementation.


Therefore, only statement 4 is entirely correct.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or oversimplifications which highlight the need for precise knowledge regarding international economic initiatives.


2. Consider the following initiatives related to the Group of Seven (G7):

1. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a joint venture between the G7 and the African Union, solely focused on fossil fuel infrastructure development.
2. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) primarily focuses on promoting sustainable fishing practices in the Arctic region.
3. The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to stabilize global oil prices by controlling the supply of oil from major producing nations.
4. The Apulia Food Systems initiative promotes sustainable agriculture and food security primarily within the G7 member states.

How many of the above statements accurately describe G7 initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on facilitating access to external investment for *clean* energy projects, not fossil fuel infrastructure. This is a crucial distinction reflecting the G7's stated commitment to climate action.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the FSOI addresses ocean health, it's not limited to sustainable fishing practices in the Arctic. Its scope is broader, encompassing various aspects of ocean conservation and sustainability globally.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to limit the revenue that Russia receives from oil sales, not to control the global supply of oil from all major producers.  The specific target of the price cap is important for understanding its geopolitical context.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Apulia Food Systems initiative aims to enhance food security and sustainable agriculture, but its scope extends beyond the G7 member states, addressing global food systems challenges.


Only the broad concept of the Apulia Food Systems initiative's aim to improve food security is accurate, though its scope is misrepresented. The other statements contain significant factual inaccuracies, demonstrating the need for precise recall of specific G7 initiatives and their objectives.


3. Consider the following statements about India's relationship with the Commonwealth:

1. India is the largest contributor to the Commonwealth's budget, providing over 70% of its annual funding.
2. India hosted the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 2003 and the Commonwealth Games in 2008.
3. The Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund has a total allocation of $75 million over five years.
4. India's participation in the Commonwealth reflects its commitment to multilateral diplomacy and South-South cooperation.

How many of these statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant contributor, it does not provide over 70% of the Commonwealth's annual budget.  The precise percentage is lower and the statement exaggerates India's financial contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India hosted CHOGM in 1983 and the Commonwealth Games in 2010, not 2003 and 2008 respectively.  The years are crucial details in understanding the chronology of India's involvement in Commonwealth events.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund has an allocation of $50 million, not $75 million, over five years.  The difference in the financial figures is a significant factual inaccuracy.

Statement 4 is correct.  India's participation in the Commonwealth does reflect its commitment to multilateral diplomacy and South-South cooperation.  This statement correctly identifies a key aspect of India's foreign policy objectives.

Therefore, only statement 4 is entirely accurate. The other statements contain inaccuracies related to quantitative data (funding percentages and financial allocations) and dates, highlighting the importance of precise factual knowledge.


4. Consider the following regarding the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):

1. The IPEF Supply Chain Council is co-chaired by India and the United States.
2.  The IPEF Crisis Response Network focuses solely on addressing disruptions caused by natural disasters.
3. The IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board comprises representatives from governments, but excludes worker and employer organizations.
4.  The IPEF aims to enhance economic cooperation among Indo-Pacific nations, focusing on digital trade and clean energy.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of the IPEF?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text does not specify that India and the United States co-chair the IPEF Supply Chain Council. While India is a member and is mentioned as Vice-Chair, the co-chair is not specified.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF Crisis Response Network addresses disruptions from various sources, including geopolitical events and not just natural disasters.  This statement understates the scope of the network's responsibilities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board includes representatives from governments, workers, and employers, fostering tripartite collaboration. This statement wrongly omits key stakeholders in the board's composition.

Statement 4 is correct. The IPEF does aim to enhance economic cooperation among Indo-Pacific nations, with a focus on areas such as digital trade and clean energy.  This statement accurately reflects a key objective of the framework.


Only statement 4 is entirely accurate.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding leadership, scope, and stakeholder involvement within the IPEF's various components.  This highlights the importance of understanding the framework's detailed structure and functions.


5. Consider the following statements about the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):

1.  Belarus joined the SCO as its ninth member state at the 2024 summit in Astana, Kazakhstan.
2. The SCO's "Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism" covers the period 2024-2028.
3.  The SCO Development Strategy extends until 2030.
4.  The SCO Initiative 'On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development' focuses solely on promoting economic cooperation among member states.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Belarus became the tenth member, not the ninth.  The precise number of member states is a key fact to remember about the SCO's composition.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The time period for the SCO's "Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism" is 2025-2027, not 2024-2028. The dates are crucial for understanding the program's operational timeframe.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SCO Development Strategy extends until 2035, not 2030.  The long-term planning horizon of the strategy is an important detail.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The SCO Initiative 'On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development' has a broader focus than just economic cooperation, encompassing peace, harmony, and development across various sectors.  The scope of the initiative is misrepresented.

Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.  All statements contain factual inaccuracies concerning membership numbers, dates, and the scope of SCO initiatives.  This underscores the need for precise recall of information about the organization.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and application, with a high difficulty level achieved through plausible distractors and close relationships between options.


**1. Consider the following international treaties:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3. The 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court
4. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty

How many of the above treaties directly address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, a type of WMD. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention similarly bans chemical weapons, another category of WMDs. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty, while not explicitly mentioning WMDs by name, implicitly restricts their placement in orbit or on celestial bodies through its prohibition on the placement of weapons of mass destruction in outer space.  The 1998 Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide;  while WMD use might be relevant to these crimes, the treaty itself doesn't directly prohibit or regulate WMDs. Therefore, only three of the listed treaties directly address the prohibition or regulation of WMDs. Options (a) and (b) underestimate the number, while (d) incorrectly includes the Rome Statute as a direct WMD regulation treaty.


**2. Consider the following international organizations and initiatives:**

1. The Universal Postal Union (UPU)
2. The Five Eyes Alliance
3. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)
4. The Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+)
5. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)

How many of the above entities primarily focus on aspects of international cooperation beyond military or security concerns?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UPU facilitates international postal services. WSIS promotes global internet development and access. OPEC+ coordinates oil production and pricing. The AIIB finances infrastructure projects in Asia.  These all primarily operate outside the realm of military or security matters. The Five Eyes Alliance, on the other hand, is an intelligence-sharing partnership with a strong security focus. Therefore, four of the listed entities focus on non-military international cooperation. Option (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the number of entities that prioritize non-military cooperation.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1. BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2024.
2. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a key project.
3. BIMSTEC's principles include sovereign equality and non-interference in internal affairs.
4. The BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX) is a regular event.
5. SAARC's dysfunctionality since 2016 has increased BIMSTEC's importance.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of BIMSTEC?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five statements are accurate reflections of BIMSTEC's characteristics and activities.  The charter's coming into force, the transport connectivity plan, the emphasis on principles of sovereign equality and non-interference, the DMEX, and the context of SAARC's relative decline are all factual elements related to BIMSTEC.  Therefore, all five statements are correct, making (c) the only viable option. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly suggest that some statements are inaccurate.


**4. Consider the following related to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to INCB.
2. The INCB's focus on cannabis legalization in various jurisdictions.
3. The "Golden Crescent" and "Golden Triangle" regions identified in INCB reports.
4.  The INCB's role in monitoring global drug abuse trends.
5. The Triple Frontier Area as a region of concern for drug trafficking.


How many of the above accurately describe the activities or areas of focus of the INCB?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five statements accurately reflect aspects of the INCB's work. The INCB does monitor global drug trends, including the regions mentioned (though the names may have changed), and it is involved in international drug control efforts.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election is a recent event reflecting ongoing INCB operations.  The INCB's reports frequently discuss cannabis legalization and its implications. Therefore, all five are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the scope of INCB activities.


**5. Consider the following statements about the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) tracks nuclear material theft.
2. Atoms4Food is an IAEA initiative focused on improving food security.
3. Atoms4NetZero is an IAEA program aimed at promoting nuclear energy for climate goals.
4. The IAEA focuses solely on the peaceful uses of nuclear technology.
5. The IAEA's International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles focuses on reactor technology innovation.

How many of the above correctly describe IAEA programs or activities?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 accurately reflect IAEA activities. The ITDB tracks illicit trafficking, Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero are real programs, and the innovative reactor project exists.  However, statement 4 is incorrect; while the IAEA promotes peaceful uses, it also has a role in nuclear safeguards and verification to prevent the misuse of nuclear materials. Therefore, only four statements are accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) either overestimate or underestimate the number of accurate statements.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF conducts Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) of member states.
2. The FATF primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing.
3. India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
4. The FATF's work includes assessing measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
5. The FATF is a subsidiary organization of the United Nations.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the functions and activities of the FATF?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the FATF's functions.  The FATF does conduct MERs, focuses on money laundering and terrorist financing, and includes WMD proliferation in its assessment criteria.  India's first MER was indeed in 2010. However, statement 5 is incorrect; the FATF is an intergovernmental organization, but it is not a subsidiary of the UN.  Therefore, four statements are correct. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the accuracy of the statements.


**7. Consider the following international mechanisms to combat transnational organized crime:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention)
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
3. The South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)
4. The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network
5. The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002

How many of the above mechanisms specifically address transnational organized crime or related issues?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five mechanisms directly address transnational organized crime or closely related issues. UNTOC is a central treaty, UNODC is the secretariat for UNTOC and works on related issues, SAWEN addresses wildlife crime (a form of TOC), GLOBE Network focuses on anti-corruption (also linked to TOC), and the SAARC convention tackles human trafficking. Therefore, all five are relevant.  Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly suggest a smaller number of relevant mechanisms.


**8. Consider the following multilateral military exercises with Indian participation:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII
2. RIMPAC Exercise
3. Exercise Pitch Black
4. Exercise Cutlass Express
5. Exercise Orion
6. Desert Flag
7. Operation Southern Readiness
8. Tiger Triumph 2024

How many of these exercises involve naval or maritime components?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only five
(d) Only six


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IBSAMAR VIII, RIMPAC, Cutlass Express, Orion, and Operation Southern Readiness all have naval or maritime components.  Desert Flag is primarily an air exercise. Tiger Triumph has amphibious elements, which includes naval aspects. Therefore, six of the listed exercises have naval or maritime components. Options (a), (b), and (c) underestimate the number of exercises with naval or maritime involvement.  The exercise names themselves are designed to be sufficiently similar to create confusion.


**9. Consider the following groups of nations:**

1. G4 Nations
2. Uniting for Consensus (UfC)
3. BRICS

How many of these groups directly relate to reform or dynamics within the United Nations Security Council?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) actively seek permanent UNSC seats, and the UfC opposes their bid. BRICS, while having members in the UNSC, is not primarily focused on UNSC reform in its stated goals. Therefore, two of the groups directly relate to UNSC reform dynamics. Options (a), (c), and (d) misrepresent the connection of these groups to UNSC issues.




Here are some UPSC-style MCQs based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and international relations, designed to be challenging and incorporate plausible distractors:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India-Bangladesh relations:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative energy project between the two nations.
3.  The BBIN initiative includes Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Myanmar.
4.  The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) facilitates enhanced connectivity.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-Bangladesh relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  Statement 2 is also correct; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant represents a significant energy cooperation initiative. Statement 4 is accurate as the PIWTT is a key element in improving trade and transit between the two countries. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The BBIN initiative comprises Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal, not Myanmar.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate. The inclusion of Myanmar as a distractor plays on the geographical proximity and potential for regional cooperation, making it a plausible but incorrect option for candidates who may not recall the precise members of the BBIN initiative.


**2. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  The upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) connects India and Bangladesh.
2.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are collaborations between India and Sri Lanka.
3.  The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydropower projects are located in Nepal.
4.  The TAPI pipeline is primarily focused on transporting electricity.

How many of the above statements accurately describe cross-border energy cooperation in South Asia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Katihar-Bornagar corridor is a key element of India-Bangladesh energy cooperation.  Statements 2, 3, and 4 are all incorrect. The Arun III and Upper Karnali projects are collaborations between India and Nepal, not Sri Lanka (Statement 2).  The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects are located in Bhutan, not Nepal (Statement 3). Finally, the TAPI pipeline transports natural gas, not electricity (Statement 4).  The incorrect options use similar geographical locations and project names to create plausible but incorrect choices, testing candidates' precise knowledge of these initiatives.


**3. Consider the following statements about India's relations with the Maldives:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives to enhance financial connectivity.
2.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives advocated for closer ties with China.
3.  Operation Neer was an Indian initiative providing medical assistance during a Maldivian health crisis.
4.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project is primarily funded by China.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct.  India did indeed launch the RuPay card in the Maldives to improve financial access and integration (Statement 1).  The "India Out" campaign was a manifestation of anti-Indian sentiment and pro-China leanings within the Maldives (Statement 2).  However, statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. Operation Neer was an Indian initiative providing water assistance, not medical aid, during a water crisis (Statement 3).  The Greater Male Connectivity Project is primarily funded by India, not China (Statement 4). The incorrect statements leverage similar themes and involve close substitutes for the correct information, making them challenging distractors.



**4. Consider the following regarding India's engagement with international organizations:**

1.  India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention.
2.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and nuclear proliferation.
3.  India chairs the Colombo Security Conclave.
4.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report focuses exclusively on opioid abuse.

How many of the above statements are accurate regarding India's role in global governance?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and has enacted legislation to comply with its provisions (Statement 1). The FATF MER indeed assesses measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, but not explicitly nuclear proliferation (Statement 2;  nuclear proliferation is a separate concern addressed by other organizations).  Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect.  Bangladesh is a member of the Colombo Security Conclave, but India is not the chair (Statement 3).  The UNODC's report covers a broader range of drug abuse issues than just opioids (Statement 4). The inclusion of plausible but incorrect details related to the functions of international organizations creates a high difficulty level.


**5. Consider the following statements related to India's energy security initiatives:**

1.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports natural gas between India and Nepal.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil.
3.  The INSTC aims to connect India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.
4.  The TAPI pipeline’s primary route avoids passing through Pakistan.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's energy infrastructure and partnerships?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline does indeed transport natural gas between India and Nepal (Statement 1), and the INSTC is designed to provide an alternative route connecting India to Russia and Europe via Central Asia (Statement 3).  Statements 2 and 4 are incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports natural gas, not crude oil (Statement 2). While the TAPI pipeline aims to avoid Pakistan, it does not entirely bypass it due to the complexities of its route (Statement 4).  The distractors involve subtle inaccuracies in the types of resources transported and route descriptions, demanding precise knowledge of these projects.


**6. Consider the following about Bhutan:**

1. Bhutan shares borders with five Indian states.
2. The Amo Chu river flows into West Bengal and is known as the Torsa.
3. Bhutan is the world's only carbon-negative country.
4. India constructed all the major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan.

Which of the above statements are correct regarding Bhutan?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Amo Chu river does flow into West Bengal and is known as the Torsa (Statement 2). Bhutan is indeed recognized for being a carbon-negative country (Statement 3). However, statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. Bhutan shares borders with four, not five, Indian states (Statement 1). While India has constructed major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan, it hasn't built *all* of them (Statement 4).  The distractors use numerical inaccuracies and generalizations to challenge candidates' precise knowledge of Bhutan's geography and energy sector.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's participation in regional initiatives:**

1.  India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2.  India signed a tripartite agreement with Iran and Afghanistan for the development of Chabahar Port.
3.  The Colombo Process focuses primarily on maritime security.
4.  The recently held India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting adopted a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's participation in regional and international collaborations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. India is a member of SAWEN (Statement 1), participated in the tripartite agreement for Chabahar Port development (Statement 2), and the Colombo Process does deal with various aspects of regional cooperation beyond maritime security (Statement 3).  The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting did adopt a Joint Action Plan for 2024-2028 (Statement 4).  The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of a broad range of Indian foreign policy engagements.  While the Colombo Process has maritime security aspects, framing it as the *primary* focus introduces a subtle element of difficulty.


**8. Consider the following regarding recent developments in India's defense and security:**

1. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is a tri-service command.
2. The Strategic Forces Command is responsible for India's nuclear arsenal.
3. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 empowers the Commander-in-Chief of all inter-service organizations.
4. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) is headed by the Minister of Defence.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command are indeed tri-service commands (Statement 1 and 2).  The Inter-services Organisations Act of 2023 does grant significant powers to the Commander-in-Chief of designated inter-service organizations (Statement 3). However, Statement 4 is incorrect. The NSCS is not headed by the Minister of Defence; its structure is more complex, involving the National Security Advisor and the Prime Minister.  The distractor in Statement 4 leverages common knowledge about the importance of the Defence Minister but misrepresents the actual organizational structure.


**9. Consider the following statements about India's relations with Malaysia:**

1.  Malaysia is home to India's third-largest diaspora after the US and UAE.
2.  MICECA is a bilateral agreement between India and Malaysia focused on military cooperation.
3.  Exercise Harimau Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and Singapore.
4.  The first regional office of HAL (Hindustan Aeronautics Limited) was inaugurated in Jakarta in 2023.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct.  Malaysia does indeed host India's third-largest diaspora (Statement 1).  However, the other statements are incorrect. MICECA focuses on economic cooperation, not military (Statement 2). Exercise Harimau Shakti is a joint exercise between India and Malaysia, not Singapore (Statement 3).  The first regional office of HAL was inaugurated in Kuala Lumpur, not Jakarta (Statement 4).  The distractors involve close geographical and organizational parallels, making them challenging for candidates who lack precise information.


**10. Consider the following regarding India's foreign policy:**

1.  The Path to Peace Summit in Switzerland focused on resolving the conflict in Ukraine.
2.  India voted in favor of the joint communiqué issued at the Path to Peace Summit.
3.  Bolivia's recent membership reflects its accession to MERCOSUR.
4.  India's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index 2024 was above 160.


How many of the above statements correctly reflect recent developments in India's foreign policy and global rankings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct.  The Path to Peace Summit did focus on the Ukraine conflict (Statement 1), Bolivia did join MERCOSUR (Statement 3), and India's ranking in the World Press Freedom Index was indeed below 160 (Statement 4). However, statement 2 is incorrect. India abstained from signing the joint communiqué at the Path to Peace Summit (Statement 2). The distractors play on the general themes of the events and rankings, making the precise details crucial for answering correctly.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, focusing on international relations and geography, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's bilateral relations:**

1.  India's largest trading partner in goods (2023) is the United States, resulting in a significant trade surplus for India.
2.  The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation forms the basis of India's relationship with Bhutan, renewed in 2007.
3.  India and Bangladesh engage in military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN.
4.  The dispute between India and Nepal primarily revolves around the interpretation of the Treaty of Sagauli (1816) concerning the origin of the River Kali.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

Statement 3 is also accurate; India and Bangladesh conduct regular joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN to enhance defense cooperation. Statement 4 correctly identifies the core of the India-Nepal border dispute: differing interpretations of the Treaty of Sagauli regarding the source of the River Kali.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect.  China, not the United States, was India's largest trading partner in goods in 2023, and India experienced a significant trade deficit with China.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


**2. Consider the following features related to geographical locations:**

1.  The world's highest saltwater lake, located in Leh district of Ladakh.
2.  A mountainous country bordering four Indian states: Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, West Bengal, and Sikkim.

(a) 1, 2, 3, 4
(b) 4, 2, 1, 3
(c) 1, 3, 2, 4
(d) 2, 1, 4, 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pangong Tso is indeed the world's highest saltwater lake, situated in Ladakh. Bhutan shares borders with the four Indian states mentioned. Lipulekh Pass is correctly described as a crucial pass in the Kumaun region, facilitating the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. Finally, the Sundarbans mangrove forest is largely located in Bangladesh.  Thus, the correct sequence matching the features to the locations is 1, 2, 3, 4.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline is indeed South Asia's first cross-border petroleum products pipeline. Statement 2 is also accurate; the TAPI pipeline is designed to transport natural gas along the route described. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The hydroelectric projects in Bhutan primarily supply electricity to India, not Bhutan itself. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the electricity corridor connects Katihar and Bornagar, both within India, to improve domestic connectivity, not cross-border trade with Nepal. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with its neighbors:**

1.  India has launched RuPay card services in Maldives.
2.  Nepal's decision to feature Indian territories on its new currency note has significantly strained relations.

Nepal's map controversy on its currency note is a known point of contention. India's construction of a Coast Guard base in the Maldives is a publicly known initiative.  And finally, Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a matter of record.  Therefore, all four statements are correct.

3.  Approximately 40% of the Sundarbans mangrove forest lies within Bangladesh.
4.  The Bay of Bengal forms its southern boundary.
5.  Myanmar borders Bangladesh to the west.

How many of the above features correctly describe geographical aspects of Bangladesh?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. Bangladesh shares borders with West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram, making statement 1 accurate. The Jamuna River, a distributary of the Brahmaputra, is indeed Bangladesh's longest river (Statement 2). The Bay of Bengal forms its southern boundary (Statement 4). However, Statement 3 is incorrect;  approximately 60%, not 40%, of the Sundarbans mangrove forest is located in Bangladesh. Statement 5 is also incorrect; Myanmar borders Bangladesh to the southeast, not the west. Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the geography of Bangladesh.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect cross-border energy cooperation initiatives in South Asia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 5 are correct. The Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydropower projects are indeed examples of collaborative energy projects between India and Bhutan. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a significant initiative for energy transportation between India and Nepal.  However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the Katihar-Bornagar corridor is an India-Bangladesh project, not India-Nepal.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Arun III and Upper Karnali projects are India-Nepal collaborations, not India-Bhutan.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the TAPI pipeline doesn't connect India and Bangladesh directly; it's a larger regional project.  Therefore, only three statements accurately describe the cross-border energy initiatives.


**4. Consider the following regarding India’s measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 is a key legislative framework.

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct.  The PMLA is a cornerstone of India's anti-money laundering efforts (Statement 1). The UAPA plays a role in preventing the financing of unlawful activities, including terrorism (Statement 2). The ED, established in 1956, is a crucial enforcement agency (Statement 4). The MLAT Portal enhances international cooperation in combating financial crimes (Statement 5). However, Statement 3 is incorrect; the FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 2008.  Therefore, four out of the five statements accurately represent India's anti-money laundering measures.

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correct. Singapore is indeed India's largest trading partner within ASEAN (Statement 1). The CECA is a key agreement between the two countries (Statement 2). Project Nexus aims to connect payment systems (Statement 4), and SIMBEX is a significant joint military exercise (Statement 5). However, Statement 3 is incorrect; India is a net *importer*, not exporter, under the CECA.  Therefore, four of the five statements accurately reflect the India-Singapore relationship.

The launch of RuPay cards, the CSA, the construction of the Coast Guard base, and the Greater Male Connectivity Project are all accurate (Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4).  However, Statement 5 is incorrect; Operation Neer was an Indian initiative providing water assistance to the Maldives, and Vaccine Maitri was the COVID-19 vaccine assistance program. Therefore, four of the five statements correctly describe the initiatives.


**9. Consider the following regarding the G7 Summit and its initiatives:**

1.  The G7 has a permanent, fixed structure.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027.
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is a key G7 initiative.
4.  The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition is aimed at managing global oil prices.
5.  The Apulia Food Systems initiative focuses on enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the G7 Summit and its initiatives?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. The PGII's funding target and the existence of FSOI, the Oil Price Cap Coalition, and the Apulia Food Systems initiative are all accurate (Statements 2, 3, 4, and 5).  However, Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure, with a rotating presidency setting the annual agenda. Therefore, four of the five statements accurately reflect the G7 Summit and its initiatives.


**10. Consider the following concerning India-China relations:**

1. China is India's largest trading partner in goods.
2. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border.
3.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash since 1962.
4.  India considers the Johnson Line as the border in the Western Sector.
5.  China claims Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-China relations?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5 are correct. China's position as India's largest trading partner, the Galwan incident's significance, India's position on the Johnson Line in the Western Sector, and China's claim on Arunachal Pradesh are all accurate (Statements 1, 3, 4, and 5). However, Statement 2 is incorrect; the LAC is not formally demarcated.  Therefore, four of the five statements accurately represent aspects of India-China relations.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's bilateral relations and initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) Four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate.  India and the Maldives have indeed strengthened their partnership as described. India's collaborations with Bhutan on hydropower and energy infrastructure are well-documented.  India's participation in CMF and Operation Crimson Barracuda are also factual. However, statement 3 is incorrect. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a G7-led effort, not a joint India-African Union project.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**3. Consider the following geographical features:**

1.  Lake Turkana, Africa's fourth-largest lake and the largest permanent desert and alkaline lake, is fed by the Omo River in Ethiopia.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in Africa and the world's largest free-standing mountain, is a stratovolcano located in Tanzania.

4.  The Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas, is the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe and is located in Egypt.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the geographical features mentioned?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately describe the geographical features.  The descriptions of Lake Turkana, Mount Kilimanjaro, Lipulekh Pass, and the Suez Canal are factually correct and do not contain any misleading information.


**4. Consider the following statements about UN-related activities and India's role:**

1. The UN Peacekeeping Force (UNPK) received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988, with India being a significant contributor of military personnel, notably sending an all-women unit to Liberia.
2. The UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP) publishes an annual flagship publication, the "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific," dating back to 1947.
3. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), now celebrating its 60th anniversary, produces key reports like the Trade & Development Report and World Investment Report.

How many of the above statements correctly describe UN-related activities and India's involvement?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect facts about UN-related activities and India's role.  The UNPK's Nobel Prize, India's contributions including the all-women unit, UNESCAP's publication history, UNCTAD's reports and anniversary, and the G4 nations' advocacy for Security Council seats are all factual and widely known.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning India's relations with Southeast Asia:**

1. India and Singapore have elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, with Singapore being India's largest trading partner in ASEAN.
2.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore aims to increase bilateral trade, with India being a net importer under this agreement.
3.  "Project Nexus," a collaborative initiative between Singapore and India, aims to connect their domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) for faster cross-border payments.
4. India and Vietnam have recently strengthened their bilateral ties through a high-level state visit.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India's relations with Southeast Asia?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect the state of India's relations with Southeast Asian nations, particularly Singapore and Vietnam. The descriptions of the partnerships, trade agreements, technological collaborations ("Project Nexus"), and high-level visits are all factually correct.  There are no misleading elements present.


**1. Consider the following initiatives related to global infrastructure development:**

1.  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2.  Energy for Growth in Africa initiative
3.  G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)
4.  G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition
5.  Apulia Food Systems initiative

How many of the above initiatives are primarily focused on sustainable development goals?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five initiatives listed are directly or indirectly linked to sustainable development goals.  The PGII aims to mobilize funding for sustainable infrastructure in developing nations, aligning with SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure). The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on clean energy, contributing to SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and climate action (SDG 13).  The FSOI addresses ocean sustainability (related to SDG 14: Life Below Water). The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to stabilize energy markets and mitigate the economic impacts of energy crises, indirectly supporting various SDGs related to economic growth and poverty reduction. Finally, the Apulia Food Systems initiative works towards enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture, directly supporting SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production).  Therefore, all five initiatives contribute to achieving various sustainable development goals.


**2. Consider the following statements about the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**

1.  It was signed in 2009.
2.  Its objective is to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India.
3.  India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN under this agreement.
4.  A 5th Joint Committee Meeting was recently held in Jakarta to review the agreement.

Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 4
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect information about the AITIGA.  The agreement was indeed signed in 2009 (1), its primary objective is to foster trade liberalization and stronger economic ties between India and ASEAN member states (2), and a recent 5th Joint Committee Meeting took place in Jakarta to review its implementation (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN, meaning India imports more from ASEAN than it exports.  This highlights a key challenge within the framework of AITIGA.


**3. Consider the following features of Currency Swap Agreements (CSAs):**

1.  They are contracts where two parties exchange currencies at a set rate with a future re-exchange at an agreed-upon rate.
2.  India's BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is an example of a CSA.
3.  CSAs primarily aim to destabilize exchange rates and reduce market liquidity.
4.  India has CSAs with Japan, UAE, and Sri Lanka.

How many of the statements accurately describe the characteristics and examples of CSAs?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 correctly describe aspects of CSAs.  A CSA involves an exchange of currencies at predetermined rates with a future reversal (1).  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is indeed a form of CSA, reflecting a multilateral agreement (2).  And India does have bilateral CSAs with Japan, UAE, and Sri Lanka, as mentioned in the text (4). Statement 3, however, is incorrect.  The primary purpose of a CSA is to *stabilize* exchange rates and *enhance* liquidity, providing a safety net for participating countries during times of financial stress.  The opposite is true.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with Singapore:**

1.  Their relationship was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024.
2.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner within ASEAN and its 6th largest globally.
3.  India has a trade surplus with Singapore due to the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA).
4.  "Project Nexus" aims to facilitate cross-border payments by connecting domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs).

How many of the statements accurately describe aspects of India-Singapore relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  The India-Singapore relationship did reach a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership level in 2024 (1). Singapore is indeed India's largest ASEAN trading partner and a top-six global partner (2). And "Project Nexus" is a collaborative initiative focused on streamlining cross-border payments (4).  However, statement 3 is false. The text clarifies that India is a *net importer* from Singapore under the CECA, resulting in a trade *deficit*, not a surplus.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER):**

1.  The MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
3.  The MER process involves peer review by FATF members.
4.  The MER also assesses measures to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Which of the above statements are accurate regarding the FATF MER process?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct descriptions of the FATF MER.  The report does assess measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing (1), it involves peer review by FATF member states (3), and it also assesses measures related to the prevention of weapons of mass destruction proliferation (4).  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the text mentions India's MER was adopted in 2010,  it doesn't state it was the *first* adoption. The  first adoption date could be earlier.  Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 are definitively accurate.


**6. Consider the following regarding the India-US relations:**

1. India is the 18th Strategic Partner of the US.
2. The India-US Trade Policy Forum was established in 2005.
3.  India has a trade surplus with the US.
4. The Malabar exercises involve India, Australia, Japan, and the US forces.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the India-US relationship?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1, 2, and 4
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. India is indeed listed as a strategic partner of the US (although the exact number may vary based on the definition of "Strategic Partner" employed) (1). The India-US Trade Policy Forum's establishment date is accurately stated as 2005 (2). The Malabar exercises involve the participation of the four nations mentioned (4).  However, statement 3 is inaccurate.  While the text doesn't provide the exact current trade balance, it does mention a trade *surplus* for India at a previous point. This could have changed. Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are definitively correct based on the information provided.


**7. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  Upcoming electricity corridor from Katihar (Bihar) to Bornagar (Assam) (India-Bangladesh)
2.  Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects (India-Nepal)
3.  Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu hydropower projects (India-Bhutan)
4.  TAPI gas pipeline project

How many of these initiatives are directly focused on enhancing electricity trade and cooperation in the South Asian region?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first three initiatives – the Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor (India-Bangladesh), the Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects (India-Nepal), and the Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu projects (India-Bhutan) – are all directly related to electricity generation, transmission, and trade within the South Asian context.  The TAPI gas pipeline, while a significant energy infrastructure project in the region, focuses on natural gas transportation, not electricity.  Therefore, only three of the listed initiatives directly address cross-border electricity trade.


**8. Consider the following statements about the India-Maldives relations:**

1.  Both countries announced a vision for a "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership."
2.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives.
3.  A Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) was signed to help Maldives manage foreign exchange reserves.
4.  The Maldives consistently pursued pro-India policies, rejecting any engagement with China.

How many of the statements accurately reflect the current state of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of recent developments in India-Maldives relations.  A comprehensive partnership vision was indeed announced (1), India did introduce the RuPay card to the Maldives (2), and a CSA was signed to aid in foreign exchange management (3). However, statement 4 is incorrect.  The text mentions a period where the Maldives adopted pro-China policies, indicating a fluctuating relationship and not a consistent pro-India stance.  Therefore, only three statements accurately capture the nuances of the relationship.


**9. Consider the following about the Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) between India and EFTA:**

1.  It's the first FTA signed by India with EFTA members.
2.  It aims to increase FDI by $100 billion and create 1 million jobs in India.
3.  It includes Mutual Recognition Agreements (MRAs) for professional services.
4.  Switzerland is the smallest trading partner of India among EFTA members.

How many of these statements accurately describe the TEPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly represent aspects of the TEPA. It is indeed India's first FTA with EFTA (1), it targets significant increases in FDI and job creation (2), and it incorporates MRAs for professional services (3).  However, statement 4 is false. The text clearly states that Switzerland is the *largest* trading partner of India among EFTA members, not the smallest.  Therefore, only three of the four statements are accurate.


**10. Consider the following regarding the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project:**

1.  It's designed to transport natural gas from the Galkynysh gas field in Turkmenistan.
2.  The Galkynysh gas field is one of the world's five largest gas fields.
3.  The pipeline spans approximately 1,800 km.
4.  The project was fully completed and operational in 2024.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the TAPI gas pipeline project?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate descriptions of the TAPI project.  The pipeline is intended to transport gas from the Galkynysh field (1), this field is among the world's largest (2), and the pipeline's length is approximately 1,800 km (3).  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The text indicates that the project is ongoing and that work is beginning on the Afghan side, meaning it's not yet fully completed and operational. Therefore, only three statements accurately reflect the project's status and features.


**1. Consider the following:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3. The Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985
4. The Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), 1999

How many of the above Acts are primarily concerned with combating financial crimes in India?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are directly involved in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively.  Both are crucial tools in preventing the flow of illicit funds and disrupting terrorist activities. FEMA, 1999, while not solely focused on crime, plays a significant role in regulating foreign exchange transactions and preventing illicit financial flows.  The NDPS Act, 1985, deals specifically with drug trafficking, which often has significant financial crime components but is not primarily focused on broader financial crimes like money laundering or terrorist financing.  Therefore, three of the listed Acts (PMLA, UAPA, and FEMA) are primarily concerned with combating financial crimes in India. Option (c) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either undercount or overcount the relevant Acts.


**2. Consider the following international organizations:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
2. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
3. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
4. The World Trade Organization (WTO)

How many of the above organizations are primarily involved in combating illicit activities related to drugs, money laundering, or terrorism financing?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing globally.  The INCB monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties. The UNODC works on a wide range of transnational organized crime issues, including drug trafficking, corruption, and terrorism.  The WTO, however, is primarily focused on regulating international trade and does not have a direct mandate in combating illicit activities like drug trafficking, money laundering, or terrorism financing.  Thus, three of the mentioned organizations (FATF, INCB, and UNODC) are primarily involved in combating illicit activities related to drugs, money laundering, or terrorism financing. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they either understate or overstate the number of relevant organizations.


**3. Consider the following statements related to India’s engagement with international organizations:**

1. India is a member of the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN).
2. India has ratified the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
3. India is a member of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network.
4. India is a member of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India’s participation in international efforts to combat transnational crime and corruption?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe India's participation in international initiatives. SAWEN focuses on combating wildlife crime in South Asia, UNTOC is a crucial convention against transnational organized crime, and GlobE is a network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities. Statement 4 is incorrect. While India collaborates with the OECD on various issues, it is not a full member of the organization. Therefore, only three of the statements accurately reflect India's participation in relevant international efforts. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to either underestimating or overestimating the number of accurate statements.


**4. Consider the following regions known for illicit drug production:**

1. The Golden Triangle (now often called the Death Triangle)
2. The Golden Crescent (now often called the Death Crescent)
3. The Triple Frontier Area
4. The Sahel Region

How many of the above regions are historically significant areas for the cultivation and trafficking of opium and other illicit drugs?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand), the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran), and the Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) are all well-known for their historical and ongoing roles in opium and other illicit drug production and trafficking. The Sahel region in Africa has also emerged as a significant area for drug trafficking, particularly of cocaine. Therefore, all four regions listed are historically significant areas for illicit drug production. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they do not account for the involvement of all four regions.


**5. Consider the following international instruments related to weapons of mass destruction:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3. The 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court
4. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT)

How many of the above instruments are directly concerned with prohibiting or regulating the development, production, or use of specific types of weapons of mass destruction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The NPT aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court but doesn't directly regulate the production or use of specific weapons. Therefore, three of the listed instruments (BWC, CWC, and NPT) are directly concerned with prohibiting or regulating weapons of mass destruction.  Option (c) is correct; options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either understate or overstate the number of relevant instruments.


**6. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. It grants special powers to the armed forces in "disturbed areas."
2. It is currently in effect in parts of Jammu and Kashmir.
3. It allows for arrests and searches without warrants.
4. It provides complete immunity from prosecution to armed forces personnel.

How many of the above statements accurately describe provisions or applications of the AFSPA?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in areas declared "disturbed," allowing actions like arrests and searches without warrants.  While it provides immunity from prosecution, it's not complete immunity; prosecution can occur with prior sanction from the central government.  The Act *was* in effect in parts of Jammu and Kashmir, but has since been replaced by a similar act, making this statement partially inaccurate depending on the timeframe considered for the question. Therefore, three of the statements largely reflect aspects of AFSPA, though one requires qualification. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to undercounting or misinterpreting the key provisions of the AFSPA.


**7. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international forums:**

1. India participated in the WSIS+20 Forum in Geneva.
2. India was an outreach country at the G7 summit.
3. India is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).
4. India is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC).

How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's participation in the specified international forums?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India's participation in the WSIS+20 Forum, its role as an outreach country at the G7 summit, and its membership in the SCO are all accurate. However, India is *not* a permanent member of the UNSC; it holds a non-permanent seat periodically. Therefore, three of the statements correctly describe India's involvement in these international bodies. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to either underrepresenting or misrepresenting India's participation in these international forums.


**8. Consider the following about India's National Security apparatus:**

1. The National Security Council (NSC) is headed by the Prime Minister.
2. The National Security Advisor (NSA) heads the Strategic Policy Group (SPG).
3. The Department of Military Affairs (DMA) was created after the Kargil War.
4. The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) directly commands all three service chiefs.


How many of the above statements are correct regarding the structure and functioning of India's national security establishment?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The NSC is indeed headed by the Prime Minister, and the NSA heads the SPG.  The DMA was created in 2019, post-Kargil War,  but the timeline is slightly inaccurate in the statement. Crucially, the CDS does *not* directly command the service chiefs; the CDS acts as a principal military advisor. Therefore, only two of the statements are entirely accurate. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to either understating or misrepresenting the organizational structure and functions.


**9. Consider the following regarding the Commonwealth:**

1.  The Commonwealth is headed by the UK Monarch.
2.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010.
3.  Decisions within the Commonwealth are made by consensus.
4.  The Commonwealth established a sub-window under the India-UN Development Fund.

How many of the above statements accurately describe the Commonwealth of Nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While the UK Monarch is the Head of the Commonwealth,  many members are republics, making the statement somewhat misleading.  India did host the Commonwealth Games in 2010, decisions are made by consensus, and the Commonwealth did establish a sub-window under the India-UN Development Fund. Therefore, three out of four statements are largely accurate, although one requires clarification regarding the Head of the Commonwealth's role. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either understate or misrepresent aspects of the Commonwealth's structure and functions.


**10. Consider the following international events and India's participation:**

1. India participated in the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting.
2. India was elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council.
3. India participated in the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) Annual Board meeting.
4. India participated in a UNSC debate on women, peace, and security.

How many of the above statements correctly reflect India's participation in recent international events and initiatives?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly reflect India's participation in recent international events.  India actively participates in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) meetings, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF), and United Nations Security Council (UNSC) debates. Therefore, all four statements are accurate. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underrepresent India's active engagement in these various international platforms.


**1. Consider the following international treaties:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention
3. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
4. The Geneva Conventions

How many of the above treaties directly address the development, production, or use of weapons of mass destruction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) and the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) explicitly prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, and use of biological and chemical weapons, respectively.  These are both categories of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court (ICC) with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, some of which may involve the use of WMDs, but the treaty itself doesn't directly regulate their production or use like the BWC and CWC. The Geneva Conventions, while crucial for international humanitarian law, primarily deal with the treatment of wounded and prisoners of war in armed conflict and don't directly focus on the creation or banning of WMDs. Therefore, only three of the listed treaties (BWC, CWC, and implicitly, the Rome Statute through its jurisdiction) directly address WMDs.


**2. Consider the following international organizations:**

1. The Universal Postal Union (UPU)
2. The Five Eyes Alliance
3. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)
4. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+)

How many of the above are primarily focused on areas other than global security or military cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations focused on international postal services. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) addresses information and communication technologies.  OPEC+ is a group of oil-producing countries focused on oil production and pricing.  Only the Five Eyes Alliance is primarily concerned with global security and intelligence sharing among its member states. Therefore, three of the listed organizations are not primarily focused on global security or military cooperation.


**3. Consider the following Acts related to India's legal framework:**

1. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000
2. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
3. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
4. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958

How many of the above Acts primarily deal with issues related to national security or combating terrorism?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, implements India's obligations under the CWC, focusing on chemical weapons. The UAPA, 1967, is designed to combat unlawful activities, including terrorism. The AFSPA, 1958, grants special powers to the armed forces in disturbed areas.  While the PMLA, 2002, addresses money laundering, which can be a tool used in terrorist financing, its primary focus is not directly national security or counter-terrorism in the same way as the other three. Therefore, three of the listed Acts primarily concern national security or counter-terrorism.


**4. Consider the following organizations involved in combating transnational crime:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)
3. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)

How many of the above are involved in international cooperation to address various aspects of transnational organized crime?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The FATF sets international standards to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The UNODC works on drugs, crime, and terrorism. The CCPCJ addresses crime prevention and criminal justice. SAWEN focuses on wildlife crime in South Asia. All four organizations are involved in international cooperation to fight aspects of transnational organized crime, albeit with different focuses.  Therefore, all four are involved in international cooperation to address transnational organized crime.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's bilateral relations:**

1.  India-China relations involve a disputed border along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

(a) Only one

India and Bangladesh share strong trade and defense ties. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation is a cornerstone of India-Bhutan relations.  India and the U.S. have extensive defense agreements and a significant trading relationship. Therefore, all four statements are correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's membership in the Commonwealth, participation in the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting, involvement in the CLGF, and being a signatory to the CWC all represent different forms of engagement in international collaborations. Therefore, all four statements are accurate.


**7. Consider the following concerning India's security apparatus:**

3. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) advises on national security.
4. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, grants disciplinary powers to commanders of inter-services organizations.

How many of the above accurately describe aspects of India's national security structure or related legislation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Andaman and Nicobar Command is indeed a tri-services command. The Strategic Forces Command is responsible for India's nuclear arsenal. The NSCS plays a vital advisory role in national security matters.  The Inter-services Organisations Act of 2023 is indeed focused on granting disciplinary and administrative powers to commanders.  Therefore, all four statements accurately describe aspects of India's national security.

The IMEC is designed to enhance connectivity and economic relations across a vast geographical area. The SCO promotes economic cooperation among its member states in Eurasia. The G7, although primarily a political forum, also engages in discussions and initiatives related to global economic issues.

The ICC prosecutes individuals for grave international crimes like genocide and war crimes.  The FATF combats money laundering and terrorist financing, focusing on financial crime.  Each organization addresses a distinct yet important aspect of global security and stability, making all four correct choices.

**Explanation:**

The Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand), the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran), and the Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) are all regions historically associated with substantial illicit drug production and trafficking.  While Canada has recently legalized cannabis, its inclusion as a major illicit drug production region is inaccurate.  Therefore, only three regions from the list are correctly identified.

While the River Thames is important, the UK's longest river is the River Severn. Statement 4 is incorrect. While the UK has a long coastline, it does not have the longest in Europe. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.



1. Consider the following features of a specific geographical entity:

1. It is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean.
2. It lies to the east of Madagascar.
3. It is situated off the southeastern coast of Africa.
4. It has neighboring islands including Reunion Island (France) to the west and Seychelles to the northwest.
5. India inaugurated its first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra (JAK) in this nation.

Which country is being described?

(a) Maldives
(b) Mauritius
(c) Seychelles
(d) Madagascar


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description clearly points to Mauritius.  Mauritius is indeed an island nation in the Indian Ocean, situated east of Madagascar and off the southeastern coast of Africa.  Reunion Island (a French overseas department) is to its west, and the Seychelles archipelago lies to its northwest. The inauguration of India's first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra further solidifies the identification of the country as Mauritius.  Maldives is also an Indian Ocean island nation but is not located southeast of Africa nor does it share the proximity to Reunion and Seychelles described.  Seychelles is in the correct region but doesn't fulfill the other criteria. Madagascar is the incorrect location given in relation to the described country.


2. Consider the following statements about a major international waterway:

1. It connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea.
2. It is the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.
3. India shifted its fuel exports to Europe from this waterway to the Cape of Good Hope route.
4. It is an artificial waterway located in a North African country.
5.  It does not utilize locks and is a sea-level waterway.

Which waterway is described?

(a) Strait of Malacca
(b) Panama Canal
(c) Suez Canal
(d) Strait of Hormuz


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Suez Canal fits all the provided descriptions.  It directly connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, providing the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe. Recent geopolitical events have led to a shift in India's fuel export routes to Europe, utilizing the longer Cape of Good Hope route as an alternative to the Suez Canal.  The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway situated in Egypt, a North African country. The fact that it's a sea-level canal without locks is also a key characteristic. The other options are incorrect. The Strait of Malacca connects the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, while the Panama Canal links the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Strait of Hormuz is a strategically important strait in the Persian Gulf, not connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas.


3. Consider the following regarding a specific geographical region:

1. It is officially part of Azerbaijan.
2. It is known as Artsakh by Armenians.
3. It is a landlocked mountainous region.
4. Russian peacekeepers recently withdrew from this region following Azerbaijan's recapture of disputed territory.
5.  Armenian separatists previously controlled part of this region.

What is the name of this region?

(a) Crimea
(b) South Ossetia
(c) Nagorno-Karabakh
(d) Transnistria


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nagorno-Karabakh perfectly matches the given description. It is a mountainous region internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but has been a point of contention, historically controlled by Armenian separatists.  The recent withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers and Azerbaijan's recapture of disputed territories are key events related to this region.  The other options are incorrect. Crimea is a peninsula annexed by Russia from Ukraine, South Ossetia is a region in Georgia, and Transnistria is a breakaway region in Moldova; none of these perfectly match all the criteria outlined in the question.


4. Consider the following elements related to a specific country:

1. It is located in Western Asia.
2. It is a narrow strip of territory along the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea.
3. It borders Syria to the north and northeast.
4. It borders Israel to the south.
5. Recent escalations have involved increased Israeli military deployment along its southern border.

Which country is described?

(a) Jordan
(b) Lebanon
(c) Syria
(d) Cyprus


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description accurately portrays Lebanon.  Lebanon's geographical location on a narrow strip of land along the eastern Mediterranean, its borders with Syria and Israel, and the recent heightened military activity along its southern border with Israel are all consistent with current geopolitical events.  Jordan, Syria, and Cyprus do not match all these criteria.  While Jordan and Syria are neighbors, they don't share the same specific coastal location and recent conflict dynamics. Cyprus is an island nation and is not directly involved in the land border conflicts described.


5. Consider the following regarding a specific island group:

1. It is located in the Indian Ocean.
2. It is situated south of the Maldives.
3. The United Kingdom is planning to restore sovereignty of this island group to Mauritius.
4. It is a strategically important group of islands in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR).
5. It is also known as the Chagos Archipelago.

Which island group is described?

(a) Andaman and Nicobar Islands
(b) Lakshadweep Islands
(c) Chagos Islands
(d) Seychelles


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chagos Islands perfectly match the provided characteristics.  Their location in the Indian Ocean, south of the Maldives, their strategic importance, and the UK's planned transfer of sovereignty to Mauritius are all well-documented facts.  The other options are unsuitable. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands and Lakshadweep Islands are Indian territories and are not involved in the described sovereignty issue. The Seychelles are geographically in the Indian Ocean but don't fit the other given criteria.


6. Consider the following about a specific river:

1. It is France's second-longest river.
2. It flows in a northwesterly direction.
3. It flows through Paris.
4. It empties into the English Channel.
5.  Its major tributaries include the Marne, Aube, and Yonne rivers.

Which river is described?

(a) Rhône River
(b) Loire River
(c) Seine River
(d) Rhine River


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Seine River fits the description perfectly.  It is indeed France's second-longest river (after the Loire), flows northwesterly through Paris, and empties into the English Channel. The Marne, Aube, and Yonne are its major tributaries. The other rivers mentioned are not located in the same area or share the same characteristics. The Rhône flows into the Mediterranean Sea, the Loire empties into the Atlantic Ocean, and the Rhine flows into the North Sea.


7. Consider the following statements about a specific lake:

1. It is located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
2. It is Africa's fourth-largest lake.
3. It is the world's largest permanent desert and alkaline lake.

5. A recent survey revealed high fish potential in this lake.

Which lake is described?

(a) Lake Victoria
(b) Lake Tanganyika
(c) Lake Turkana
(d) Lake Malawi


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana precisely matches the description. Its location straddling Kenya and Ethiopia, its status as Africa's fourth-largest lake, and its unique characteristic as the world's largest permanent desert and alkaline lake are all accurate. The Omo River is its primary water source, and the recent fish stock assessment is also connected to Lake Turkana. The other lakes are incorrect because they don't share all the mentioned characteristics.


8. Consider the following about a specific mountain:

1. It is located in Tanzania.
2. It is the highest peak in Africa.
3. It is the world's largest free-standing mountain.
4. It is a stratovolcano.
5. A recent expedition team unfurled the Indian national flag on its Uhuru Summit.

Which mountain is described?

(a) Mount Kenya
(b) Mount Kilimanjaro
(c) Mount Elgon
(d) Mount Meru


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mount Kilimanjaro aligns with all the given details. Its location in Tanzania, its status as Africa's highest peak, and its distinction as the world's largest free-standing mountain are all well-known facts.  Its volcanic nature (stratovolcano) and the recent Indian expedition to its Uhuru Peak further confirm its identity. The other mountains do not fit all these criteria.


9. Consider the following elements related to a specific geographical area:

1. It is located in northeastern Europe.
2. It is bordered by Estonia, Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania.
3. Its maritime boundaries include the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga.
4. India recently established a new resident mission in this area.
5. It is a member of the European Union and NATO.

Which country is described?

(a) Poland
(b) Finland
(c) Latvia
(d) Estonia


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Latvia perfectly fits the description. Its location in northeastern Europe, its land borders with Estonia, Russia, Belarus, and Lithuania, and its maritime boundaries with the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Riga are all accurate.  The recent establishment of an Indian resident mission and its membership in the EU and NATO further pinpoint the country as Latvia. The other options are incorrect because they don't share all of the mentioned characteristics.


10. Consider the following regarding a specific island:

1. It is located in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal.
2. It is a small coral island.
3. Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on its sovereignty in 1974.
4.  Reports have claimed that the US sought to establish a military base on this island.
5. It is part of Bangladesh's territory.

Which island is described?

(a) Coco Island
(b) Great Nicobar
(c) Saint Martin's Island
(d) Preparis Island


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Saint Martin's Island matches the given description.  Its location in the northeastern Bay of Bengal, its status as a small coral island, the 1974 sovereignty agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar, and the reported US interest in establishing a military base all point to Saint Martin's Island.  The other islands do not fit all the given criteria.


1. Consider the following statements regarding India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing:

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004.
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation.
4. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956 and plays a crucial role in investigations.
5.  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, is primarily focused on national security and has limited application in money laundering cases.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's approach to combating financial crimes?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA, 2002, is the primary legislation for preventing money laundering in India.  The FIU-IND is the central national agency for receiving, processing, analyzing and disseminating financial intelligence. The MLAT portal streamlines international cooperation in investigations. The ED plays a vital role in enforcing the PMLA and other financial crime laws. While the UAPA, 1967, deals with unlawful activities, its primary focus is not on money laundering, although it can be used in conjunction with other laws in specific cases involving terrorist financing. Therefore, statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 are accurate. Statement 5 is a distractor, presenting a related but less directly relevant piece of legislation.


2. Consider the following international organizations and their initiatives:

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts mutual evaluations of countries' anti-money laundering measures.
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) publishes reports on global drug trends and wildlife crime.
3. The Group of Seven (G7) launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations.
4. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) focuses primarily on regional security and economic cooperation in Central Asia and has limited involvement in global drug control initiatives.
5. The Commonwealth, a political association of 56 member states, primarily focuses on promoting democracy and development and has no direct involvement in infrastructure financing.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the functions and activities of the named international organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's core function is indeed the peer review and assessment of countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The UNODC accurately produces reports on drug trends and wildlife crime. The G7's PGII is a real initiative aimed at infrastructure development. Statement 4 is a distractor; while the SCO does have economic cooperation aspects, its primary focus is regional security, and it is not a major player in global drug control.  Similarly, statement 5 is a distractor, as the Commonwealth's focus is primarily political and developmental, not infrastructure financing.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 3 are entirely accurate.


3. Consider the following statements regarding India's international relations:

1. India is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
2. India actively participates in the East Asia Summit (EAS).

4. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues among ASEAN member states and their partners, and India is a key participant.
5.  India’s engagement with ASEAN began in the late 1990s, significantly after the formation of ASEAN.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India's relationship with ASEAN?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India is not a member of ASEAN but a key dialogue partner and strategic partner.  India actively participates in the EAS.  India does have a trade deficit with ASEAN. The ARF is accurately described, and India is a significant participant. Statement 5 is incorrect; India's formal engagement with ASEAN began in 1992.  Therefore, four statements are correct.


4. Consider the following initiatives related to counter-terrorism:

1. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy aims to enhance national, regional, and international efforts.
2. The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund supports UNOCT's global programs, including countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) and countering terrorist travel.
3. India has contributed financially to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund.
4. The Regional Anti-terrorist Structure of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) focuses on regional counter-terrorism efforts within its member states.
5. The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has a highly effective and consistently active counter-terrorism mechanism.


How many of the statements above accurately represent global and regional counter-terrorism initiatives and India's role?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is a real and significant initiative.  The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund and its supported programs are accurate. India's contribution to the fund is also a fact. The SCO's Regional Anti-terrorist Structure is a valid regional counter-terrorism mechanism. However, statement 5 is a distractor; SAARC's counter-terrorism mechanism has been largely ineffective due to political tensions among member states. Therefore, four statements are correct.


5. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international forums and agreements:

1. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
2. India has been elected to the steering committee of the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network.
3. India is a member of the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).
4. India is a signatory to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).
5. India is a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect India's participation in international organizations and agreements?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India is indeed a signatory to the CWC.  India's election to GlobE's steering committee is accurate.  India's membership in the INCB is also correct. India has ratified the UNTOC. However, statement 5 is incorrect; India is not a member of the Five Eyes alliance.  Therefore, only three statements are correct.


6. Consider the following organizations and their functions:

1. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations.
2. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) assists countries in accessing financial resources for infrastructure projects.
3. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+) coordinates oil production policies.
4. The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay aims to facilitate cross-border payments among BRICS nations.
5. The Commonwealth of Nations is primarily focused on economic cooperation and trade agreements among its members.


How many of the above statements correctly describe the functions of the named organizations?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UPU's status as a UN agency is accurate.  The AIIB's function is accurately described. OPEC+'s role in oil production coordination is correct. The BCBPI's aim is accurate.  However, Statement 5 is a distractor; while the Commonwealth has some economic aspects, its primary focus is political and developmental, not solely economic cooperation and trade agreements.  Therefore, four statements are correct.


7. Consider the following international agreements and their objectives:

1. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement aims to promote free trade among SAARC member states.
3. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
4. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement focuses on strengthening critical supply chains among participating countries.
5.  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement (CRA) is primarily focused on promoting sustainable agricultural practices among BRICS members.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the objectives of the named international agreements?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) Only two
(d) All five

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The objectives of AITIGA, SAFTA, IMEC, and the IPEF Supply Chain Agreement are accurately described.  Statement 5 is a distractor; the BRICS CRA is a financial agreement aimed at providing a safety net for member states' currencies, not focusing on agriculture. Therefore, four statements are correct.

Statement 1 is correct. The IPEF is structured around four pillars: Trade, Supply Chain Resilience, Clean Economy, and Fair Economy.  These pillars represent key areas of cooperation among participating countries. Statement 2 is incorrect.  Australia and New Zealand are members of the IPEF.  The framework includes a diverse range of Indo-Pacific countries committed to economic cooperation and development. Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.

(c) United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and International Energy Agency (IEA)
(d) World Economic Forum (WEF) and the International Data Corporation (IDC)

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Cable Protection Committee (ICPC) jointly launched the International Advisory Body for Submarine Cable Resilience.  The ITU plays a crucial role in global telecommunications, while the ICPC focuses on the protection of submarine cables, which are vital for global communication infrastructure. The other options represent organizations with different mandates not directly related to the specific task of establishing this advisory body for submarine cable resilience.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the UNCCD is a legally binding international agreement, it's not the sole one addressing desertification and land degradation. Other relevant international agreements and initiatives also exist. Statement 2 is correct. Achieving land degradation neutrality by 2030 is a key objective of the UNCCD.  This involves balancing the gains and losses of land resources. Statement 3 is correct. India did host a session of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the UNCCD.  The specific number of the COP might need verification, but the fact that India hosted a session is accurate. Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.

(c) It aims to promote peace, security, and stability in Africa.
(d) It has 50 member states, representing all the countries in Africa.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement (d) is not entirely correct. While the AU comprises a large number of African countries, it does not include all the countries in Africa.  There might be some states with observer status or those not yet fully integrated into the AU's structure. The other statements accurately reflect the AU's establishment, headquarters location, and primary goals.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia, the text states that India is the *second* biggest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia.  This subtle difference is crucial.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, but it doesn't specify crude oil; it is implied to be for other forms of energy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Act was passed by the US *House of Representatives*, not the Senate.  This distinction is important in understanding the US legislative process.

Statement 4 is incorrect. The Chabahar Port agreement's duration is 10 years, not 5.  The timeframe is a significant detail in assessing the long-term commitment.



**4. Consider the following organizations and their key features:**

1.  The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) Charter came into force in 2023.

1.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.
2.  India has a trade surplus with the US.
3.  The Malabar exercises involve India, the US, Japan, and Australia.
4.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has never been a point of contention between India and the US.


Which of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the India-US relationship?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**  Statement 1 is incorrect; LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2018. This slight inaccuracy serves as a key distractor. Statement 2 is correct; India does maintain a trade surplus with the United States. Statement 3 is also accurate; the Malabar exercises include the four nations mentioned.  Statement 4 is incorrect; CAATSA has indeed been a source of tension due to India's engagement with Russia. The inclusion of this false statement, directly related to sanctions and international trade, tests the candidate's knowledge of a complex geopolitical issue.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the Chabahar Port:**

1.  The Chabahar Port is located on the Arabian Sea.
2.  India, Iran, and Afghanistan signed a tripartite agreement in 2016 for its development.
3.  The port is intended to bypass Pakistan, providing a direct sea route to Afghanistan.

How many of the above statements are correct concerning the Chabahar Port?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe the Chabahar Port's location, the tripartite agreement, and its strategic significance in bypassing Pakistan for access to Afghanistan.  However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Chabahar Port is directly linked to the INSTC, serving as a crucial node in this major transportation network connecting India to Central Asia and beyond.  This inclusion of a factually incorrect statement related to a key regional infrastructure project serves as an effective distractor for those lacking precise knowledge.

How many of the statements above correctly describe the objectives or provisions of the mentioned international agreements?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The Rome Statute did establish the ICC for prosecuting war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and *use* of such weapons. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Chemical Weapons Convention bans the *production*, *stockpiling*, and *use* of chemical weapons completely. Statement 4 is incorrect; the Geneva Protocol prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in *any* armed conflict. Therefore, only one statement (3) is accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's participation in international initiatives:**

1. India's participation in Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) predates 2022.
2. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy following its CMF membership.

How many of the above statements accurately represent India's involvement in various international collaborations and domestic policies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda was indeed the first such operation after India joined CMF in 2022, and India's participation in the WSIS+20 Forum showcases its support for the WSIS outcomes. Statement 1 is incorrect; India joined CMF in 2022. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text states that AFSPA was *extended* to parts of Nagaland, not revoked. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements concerning Lake Turkana and Mount Kilimanjaro:**

1. Lake Turkana is located in the central region of Kenya.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro is part of a larger mountain range in Tanzania.

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The Omo River is indeed the main water source for Lake Turkana, and Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano with the described composition. Statement 1 is incorrect; Lake Turkana is in northwestern Kenya. Statement 2 is incorrect; Mount Kilimanjaro is a freestanding mountain, not part of a range.  Therefore, three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.



**6. Consider the following about India-Bangladesh relations:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner globally.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh.
3. Bangladesh is bordered by Myanmar to the north.
4. The Jamuna River, a part of the Brahmaputra, is the longest river in Bangladesh.


How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India-Bangladesh relations or Bangladesh's geography?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are correct. The Maitree Power Plant is a joint venture, and the Jamuna River is the longest in Bangladesh. Statement 1 is incorrect; Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, not globally. Statement 3 is incorrect; Bangladesh borders Myanmar to the *southeast*. Therefore, only two statements (2 and 4) are accurate.


**7. Consider the following regarding international organizations and their initiatives:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat only money laundering.
2. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
3. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) primarily focuses on providing financial assistance to high-income countries.
4. OPEC+ extended its deep oil output cuts indefinitely.


How many of the above statements accurately reflect the activities or focus of the mentioned international bodies?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is accurate. The UNODC report does indeed highlight cannabis as the most widely abused drug.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the FATF MER assesses measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Statement 3 is incorrect; the AIIB assists *low*-income countries. Statement 4 is incorrect; OPEC+ extended its cuts into 2025, not indefinitely.  Therefore, only one statement (2) is correct.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct.  India did review bilateral relations with Togo, and the first secretary-level defence meeting with the DRC took place. Statement 1 is incorrect; the first overseas JAK was inaugurated in Mauritius, not Seychelles. Statement 2 is incorrect; the UK bill aims to send asylum seekers to Rwanda, not Mauritius. Therefore, three statements (3 and 4) are accurate.


**10. Consider the following about ASEAN and related summits:**

1. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 2005.
2. India is a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum.
3. The East Asia Summit (EAS) exclusively comprises ASEAN member states.

How many of the above statements accurately describe ASEAN institutions or India's engagement with ASEAN?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. India is indeed a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum. Statement 1 is incorrect; the ARF was established in 1994.

2.  Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
3.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention)
4.  South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN)
5.  Global Firearms Programme (GFP)

How many of the above are mechanisms or initiatives related to tackling transnational organized crime, as discussed in the provided context?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five elements are directly related to combating transnational organized crime (TOC). The 33rd Session of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) explicitly called for steps to combat TOC and launched the GenJust initiative. The UNTOC (Palermo Convention) is a central treaty framework for addressing TOC. SAWEN is a regional initiative focusing on wildlife crime, a significant aspect of TOC. The GFP, under the UNODC, is another initiative targeting the flow of illegal firearms, a crucial tool in many TOC activities.  Therefore, all five are relevant, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly limit the number of relevant mechanisms.


**3. Consider the following:**

1.  BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity
2.  BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX)
3.  Sovereign equality, Territorial integrity, Political independence
4.  Focus areas: Trade, Environment and Climate Change, Security
5.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002

How many of the above are associated with BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation)?

(a) Only two
(b) Only three
(c) Only four
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Four of the listed items are directly associated with BIMSTEC. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity and the BIMSTEC Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX) are key projects and initiatives. The principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and political independence are fundamental to BIMSTEC's operational framework.  The focus areas listed (Trade, Environment and Climate Change, Security) represent core pillars of BIMSTEC's multi-sectoral cooperation. However, the SAARC Convention is related to SAARC, a separate regional organization, and not directly associated with BIMSTEC. Therefore, only four items (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly linked to BIMSTEC, making (c) the correct answer. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an element from a different regional organization.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967
3.  Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
4.  Directorate of Enforcement (ED)
5.  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal

How many of the above are measures taken by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, as reported in the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five items are accurately described as Indian measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The PMLA and UAPA are key legislative frameworks. The FIU-IND and ED are crucial institutions involved in enforcement. The MLAT Portal facilitates international cooperation.  The MER from the FATF would indeed assess India's performance across all these aspects. Therefore, all five are correct, making (c) the right answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly underestimate the comprehensiveness of India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures.


**5. Consider the following:**

1.  Cannabis
2.  Opioids
3.  Amphetamines
4.  Cocaine
5.  Ecstasy

How many of the above are among the most abused drugs globally, according to the UNODC's World Drug Day report?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**  The UNODC's report explicitly mentions cannabis, opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy as among the most widely abused drugs globally. Therefore, all five options are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more drugs explicitly identified in the report as being among the most widely abused.



**6. Consider the following:**

1.  Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)
2.  Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand)
3.  Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran)
4.  Death Triangle
5.  Death Crescent

How many of the above are regions identified by the UNODC as being significantly affected by drug abuse?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The UNODC report highlights the Triple Frontier Area, the Golden Triangle, and the Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent) as regions heavily affected by drug abuse.  While "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent" are alternative names used in some reports to emphasize the severity of the drug problem in these regions, the core geographic areas remain the same. Therefore, four regions are correctly identified, making (b) the correct answer. Option (a) underestimates the number of regions mentioned, while (c) incorrectly includes the alternative names as separate entities.


**7. Consider the following:**

1.  1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2.  1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3.  1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC)
4.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 (India)
5.  Outer Space Treaty, 1967

How many of the above are international treaties or legal instruments related to the regulation or prohibition of weapons?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** All five options represent international agreements or laws concerning weapons. The Biological Weapons Convention and Chemical Weapons Convention directly prohibit the development and use of specific weapon types. The Rome Statute establishes the ICC, which prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, often involving weapons. India's Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is domestic legislation implementing the international Chemical Weapons Convention. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 aims to prevent the weaponization of outer space.  Therefore, all five are relevant, making (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more valid treaties or legal instruments.


**8. Consider the following:**

1.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)
2.  Operation Crimson Barracuda
3.  Operation Sadbhav
4.  Exercise IBSAMAR VIII
5.  Exercise RIMPAC

How many of the above are multinational maritime exercises or operations involving the Indian Navy or Coast Guard?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Four of the listed items involve multinational maritime exercises or operations. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational naval coalition, and Operation Crimson Barracuda is an operation conducted under CMF. Exercise IBSAMAR VIII is a joint naval exercise between India, Brazil, and South Africa. Exercise RIMPAC is a major international maritime exercise. However, Operation Sadbhav is a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operation, not primarily a military exercise.  Therefore, four items (1, 2, 4, and 5) are correctly categorized, making (b) the correct answer. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes Operation Sadbhav, which is not a primarily maritime military exercise.


**9. Consider the following:**

1.  Exercise Yudh Abhyas
2.  SALVEX
3.  Vajra Prahar
4.  Sea Defenders-2024
5.  Exercise Tarkash

How many of the above are joint military exercises between India and the United States?

(a) Only three
(b) Only four
(c) All five
(d) Only two

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** Three of the listed exercises are joint military exercises between India and the United States: Exercise Yudh Abhyas, SALVEX (a naval exercise), and Vajra Prahar (an army exercise).  Sea Defenders-2024 is a joint exercise between the Indian Coast Guard and the United States Coast Guard, and Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise, but not exclusively between India and the US. Therefore, only three exercises are correctly categorized as joint India-US military exercises, making (a) the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include or exclude exercises that do not strictly fit the criteria.


**10. Consider the following:**

1.  Exercise Shakti
2.  Exercise Varuna
3.  Exercise KAZIND-2024

**1. Consider the following:**

1. Lake Turkana's water source is the Nile River.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro is part of a larger mountain range.
3. Lipulekh Pass connects India, China, and Bhutan.
4. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Lake Turkana's primary water source is the Omo River, located in Ethiopia, not the Nile River.  The Nile River is located in a completely different geographic region.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Mount Kilimanjaro is a freestanding mountain, not part of a mountain range. This is a key characteristic that sets it apart from other significant peaks. Statement 3 is incorrect; Lipulekh Pass is located near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The geopolitical significance of this pass stems from its proximity to this tri-junction. Statement 4 is incorrect; The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, facilitating maritime trade between Asia and Europe. It does not connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The Panama Canal fulfills that function. Therefore, three statements are incorrect.


**2. Consider the following:**

1. Sittwe Port is located in Bangladesh.
2. Saint Martin's Island is claimed by both Bangladesh and Myanmar.
3. Guam Island is a territory of Japan.
4. The Seine River flows into the Mediterranean Sea.

How many of the above statements regarding geographical locations are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sittwe Port is located in the Rakhine State of Myanmar, not Bangladesh.  Its strategic importance lies in its potential to enhance trade and transit opportunities for India's Northeast. Statement 2 is partially correct, but the phrasing is misleading. While there was a historical dispute, in 1974, Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed that Saint Martin's Island belongs to Bangladesh. The question creates confusion by implying an ongoing dispute. Statement 3 is incorrect. Guam Island is an unincorporated territory of the United States, not Japan.  Its strategic location in the Pacific Ocean has significant geopolitical implications. Statement 4 is incorrect. The Seine River flows into the English Channel at Le Havre, France, not the Mediterranean Sea.  This detail highlights its importance to France's geography and economy.  Three statements are factually incorrect or misleading.


**3. Consider the following:**

1. The Nagorno-Karabakh region is officially part of Armenia.
2. The Nord Stream pipelines transport natural gas from Germany to Russia.

How many of the above statements regarding geopolitical locations and features are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Nagorno-Karabakh region is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan, despite the ongoing territorial dispute and Armenian separatist claims.  This is a significant point of contention in the region's history and ongoing conflicts. Statement 2 is incorrect. The Nord Stream pipelines transport natural gas from Russia to northern Germany, not the other way around.  The disruption of these pipelines had significant geopolitical and economic consequences. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kursk region borders Ukraine, but it does not border Belarus.  Its location on the Eastern European Plain is geographically important. Statement 4 is incorrect. The capital of Ukraine is Kyiv, not Moscow.  This factual error is a significant distractor, given the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.  Three of the statements are demonstrably false.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  Bolivia's main border is with Peru.
2.  The Isthmus of Panama connects North and South America.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Bolivia does share a border with Peru, it also borders Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Chile. The question uses a simplification to mislead. Statement 2 is correct.  The Isthmus of Panama's geographical significance is its connection of the two continents. Statement 3 is incorrect. Trinidad and Tobago is located in the Atlantic Ocean, specifically in the southeastern West Indies.  Its location near South America is a significant geographical feature. Statement 4 is incorrect. New Zealand is located in the South Pacific Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean.  Its island nation status and location in the Southern Hemisphere are important facts. Three of the four statements contain geographical inaccuracies or misleading simplifications.


**5. Consider the following statements about international organizations and agreements:**

1. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is headquartered in Washington D.C.
2. The Arab League Summit of 2024 was held in Saudi Arabia.

How many of the above statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIIB is headquartered in Beijing, China, not Washington D.C.  Its role in infrastructure development in Asia is a key aspect of its function. Statement 2 is incorrect. The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Saudi Arabia. The location of the summit is a significant detail about the organization's activities. Statement 3 is correct.  ASEAN + 3 includes Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US.  The composition reflects the geopolitical dynamics of the region. Statement 4 is incorrect. SAARC decisions require unanimity among its member states, not a simple majority vote. This reflects the challenges of consensus-building in regional organizations.  Three of the statements are factually incorrect.


**6. Consider the following about India's relations with other countries:**

1.  India and Bhutan share energy projects like the Kurichu Hydroelectric Project.
2.  The TAPI pipeline is a joint venture between India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India and Bhutan have collaborated on several hydroelectric projects, including the Kurichu project. This highlights the close energy cooperation between the two countries. Statement 2 is incorrect. The TAPI pipeline (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) aims to transport natural gas, but Pakistan's participation has been significantly affected by political instability.  The pipeline's feasibility is subject to ongoing geopolitical challenges. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Currency Swap Agreement between India and Maldives is designed to assist Maldives in managing its foreign exchange reserves, not primarily to benefit India. This reflects India's approach to assisting its neighbors. Statement 4 is incorrect. The 8-degree channel separates the island of Minicoy (part of Lakshadweep, India) from the Maldives.  The question uses a geographically close island to create confusion. Three of the statements contain factual inaccuracies or misleading interpretations.


**7. Consider the following statements about India's foreign policy and partnerships:**

1. Singapore is India's largest trading partner globally.
2. India has a trade surplus with ASEAN.
3. Project Nexus links India's UPI with payment systems in several Southeast Asian countries.
4. India and Vietnam recently signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA).

How many of the above statements regarding India's international economic relations are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Singapore is a major trading partner for India, it is not India's largest trading partner globally.  The question uses a prominent partner to create a distractor. Statement 2 is incorrect. India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus.  This reflects the complexities of India's trade balance with the region. Statement 3 is correct. Project Nexus aims to link India's UPI with payment systems in several Southeast Asian nations, including Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Thailand. This highlights India's technological diplomacy. Statement 4 is incorrect. While India and Vietnam have a strong strategic partnership, a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) is not mentioned in the given text. The question introduces a plausible but ultimately false statement.  Two of the statements are incorrect.


**8. Consider the following:**

1. Japan is composed of five main islands.
2.  Japan is located along the western edge of the Pacific Ring of Fire.
3.  India and Singapore elevated their strategic partnership to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2023.
4.  Exercise SIMBEX is a joint military exercise between India and Sri Lanka.

How many of the statements are incorrect?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Japan is composed of four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The question introduces a slightly incorrect number to create confusion. Statement 2 is correct.  Japan's location on the Pacific Ring of Fire is a significant geological fact impacting its vulnerability to earthquakes and volcanic activity. Statement 3 is incorrect. India and Singapore elevated their strategic partnership to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2024, not 2023. The question uses a year close to the correct one to increase difficulty. Statement 4 is incorrect. Exercise SIMBEX is a joint naval exercise between India and Singapore, not Sri Lanka.  The question uses a similar-sounding country name to mislead.  Two of the four statements contain errors.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The India-Maldives partnership reflects this. Statement 2 is incorrect; RuPay cards were launched in the Maldives, not Bangladesh. Statement 3 is incorrect; the provided text refers to grants for HICDPs in the Maldives, not Sri Lanka.  Statement 4 is incorrect; AIIPOIP includes significant defense and security cooperation components alongside economic aspects. Thus, only two statements are correct.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the ARF was established in 1994. Statement 2 is partially correct; the EAS has 18 members, including the US, but the text doesn't explicitly exclude Russia, although it does not mention Russia's membership.  Statement 3 is partially correct; while the Colombo Process involves regional cooperation, the provided text does not specifically mention its focus on maritime security. Statement 4 is incorrect;  the text mentions Bangladesh joining the CSC, implying there were already at least four members, but does not list all members.  Therefore, only one statement is definitively correct.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or ambiguities, making them unsuitable as entirely correct statements.



**4. Consider the following features of geographical locations:**

These questions demand precise factual knowledge and careful analysis, aligning with the rigorous nature of UPSC examinations.  The distractors are designed to challenge even well-prepared candidates.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The difficulty level aims to be high, incorporating plausible distractors and requiring precise factual recall.


**1. Consider the following international agreements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention
3. The 1998 Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court

How many of the above agreements specifically address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, directly addressing weapons of mass destruction.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention similarly bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, another category of weapons of mass destruction.  The Rome Statute, while establishing the International Criminal Court to prosecute serious international crimes, including those committed using weapons of mass destruction, doesn't directly prohibit or regulate the weapons themselves. Its focus is on prosecuting individuals responsible for their use, not the weapons' existence. Therefore, only two of the listed agreements directly address the prohibition or regulation of weapons of mass destruction. Option (a) is incorrect because it underestimates the number of relevant agreements. Option (c) is incorrect because the Rome Statute does not directly regulate the production or use of the weapons themselves. Option (d) is incorrect as two of the agreements are directly relevant.


**2. Consider the following international organizations:**

1. Universal Postal Union (UPU)
2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)
3. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+)
4. Five Eyes Alliance


How many of the above organizations are primarily focused on economic cooperation or infrastructure development?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is explicitly dedicated to financing infrastructure projects, primarily in Asia. OPEC+, while influencing global energy markets and thus economies, is primarily focused on oil production and pricing. Its impact is economic but its core function is not economic cooperation in the same way as AIIB. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) focuses on postal services, not broader economic cooperation or infrastructure. The Five Eyes Alliance is primarily an intelligence-sharing network among five countries, with no direct economic or infrastructure development mandate.  Therefore, only the AIIB directly focuses on economic cooperation and infrastructure development among its listed options.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either overestimate or underestimate the number of organizations focused on economic cooperation or infrastructure development.


**3. Consider the following initiatives related to the United Nations:**

1. UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy
2. UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF)
3. UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP)
4. UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund


How many of the above initiatives are directly involved in addressing global security challenges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy is explicitly designed to enhance international counter-terrorism efforts. The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund directly supports programs aimed at combating terrorism. UNESCAP, while contributing to regional stability through economic development, does not have a primary focus on immediate security challenges in the same way as the counter-terrorism initiatives. The UN Global Supply Chain Forum deals with economic resilience and disruptions, but indirectly relates to security by addressing vulnerabilities in global supply chains that could be exploited. Therefore, three of the listed initiatives are directly involved in addressing global security challenges. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the direct involvement of the listed initiatives in addressing global security challenges.


**4. Consider the following reports and publications:**

1.  World Military Expenditure, 2023 Report (SIPRI)
2.  Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2024 (UNESCAP)
3.  Trade & Development Report (UNCTAD)
4.  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India (FATF)


How many of the above publications are primarily focused on economic or financial assessments?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2024 (UNESCAP) provides an economic analysis of the Asia-Pacific region. The Trade & Development Report (UNCTAD) focuses on global trade and development issues, providing economic analysis. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India (FATF) assesses India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, which is directly related to economic and financial stability.  The World Military Expenditure report, while having economic implications, focuses primarily on military spending and not broader economic assessments.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misrepresent the primary focus of the listed publications.


**5. Consider the following regional organizations:**

1. BIMSTEC
2. SAARC
3. G4 Nations
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)


How many of the above organizations primarily focus on cooperation among countries in the Asian continent?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) includes countries from South Asia and Southeast Asia. SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) comprises South Asian nations. The G4 Nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) although geographically diverse, have significant cooperative initiatives in the Asian context.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) includes Central Asian countries as well as others.  Therefore, all four organizations listed have a primary focus on cooperation among Asian countries, albeit with varying geographic scope. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of organizations focused on Asian cooperation.


**6. Consider the following initiatives or programs:**

1.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2.  "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
3.  Atoms4Food (IAEA)
4.  Quad Cancer Moonshot


How many of the above initiatives focus on global development and/or health challenges?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative specifically targets clean energy access in Africa. Atoms4Food uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security, directly addressing a development challenge. The Quad Cancer Moonshot partnership focuses on combating cervical cancer, a major global health concern.  Therefore, all four initiatives directly address global development or health challenges. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the breadth of initiatives focusing on global development and health.


**7. Consider the following acts and agreements:**

**Explanation:**  Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately reflect recent developments and key aspects of India-Maldives relations. The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" represents a strengthened bilateral framework.  The RuPay card introduction aims at boosting financial integration. The CSA is a vital tool for financial stability and support.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding India-China relations:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border.
2.  China's claims in the Western Sector are based on the Johnson Line.
3.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash since 1962.
4.  India has a significant trade surplus with China.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The LAC is not formally demarcated; it's a disputed line. China's claims in the Western Sector are based on the McDonald Line, not the Johnson Line.  India has a significant trade *deficit* with China, not a surplus.


**2. Consider the following regarding the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1.  BIMSTEC's charter came into force in 2022.
2.  All BIMSTEC decisions are made by unanimity.
3.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a major project.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The BIMSTEC charter came into force in May 2024, not 2022. While consensus is important in BIMSTEC, it doesn't necessitate strict unanimity like SAARC.  BIMSTEC does not include all South Asian countries; Afghanistan is notably absent.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Chabahar Port:**

1.  It is located on the Arabian Sea.
2.  The tripartite agreement for its development involved India, Iran, and Pakistan.
3.  It offers a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are correct. Chabahar Port is located on the Gulf of Oman (a part of the Arabian Sea), and it does provide a direct route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. However, the tripartite agreement included India, Iran, and Afghanistan, not Pakistan.  While the port is strategically significant for INSTC, there isn't necessarily a dedicated rail link connecting the two directly.


**4. Consider the following regarding India's relations with the United States:**

1.  India is a Major Defence Partner of the US.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.
3.  India has a trade deficit with the US.
4.  The Malabar exercises involve India, the US, Japan, and Australia.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 4 only

**5. Consider the following about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and nuclear proliferation.
2.  India's first MER was adopted in 2010.
3.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1956.
4.  The FATF is a regional organization focused on South Asia.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  The FATF's MER does assess money laundering, but not necessarily nuclear proliferation (it focuses on terrorist financing and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction). The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956. The FATF is a global organization, not limited to South Asia.



**6. Consider these features of the  National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS):**

1. It was established in 1998 based on recommendations from a task force.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) is headed by the Prime Minister.

4. The NSCS is responsible for drafting and implementing all foreign policy decisions.

How many of the statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 1 are partially correct.  The NSCS was constituted in 1999, not 1998, based on K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations. The SPG, headed by the NSA, does indeed facilitate inter-ministerial coordination. However, the NSAB is headed by the NSA, not the Prime Minister.  The NSCS supports the NSC; it doesn't solely control foreign policy implementation.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The Maitree power plant is a joint venture. Bangladesh borders five Indian states.  However, Bangladesh is India's biggest trading partner in South Asia, but the largest trading partner in Asia is not stated in the provided text. The Jamuna River is a major river, not the shortest.

2. The Kargil conflict primarily took place in the Ladakh region of Jammu and Kashmir.
3. The war concluded in July 1999.
4.  India's victory in the war was decisive and resulted in significant territorial gains.


How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct.  Operation Vijay focused on the Kargil district, not Siachen. The conflict was primarily in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, not Ladakh. While India ultimately prevailed, the war didn't result in significant territorial gains; the focus was on regaining territory already claimed by India.


**9. Consider the following regarding the ASEAN-India relations:**

1. ASEAN includes all the countries of Southeast Asia.
2. India has a trade surplus with ASEAN.
3. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers.
4.  The East Asia Summit is a key forum for ASEAN-India cooperation.


Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers.  ASEAN doesn't include all Southeast Asian countries (e.g., East Timor). India has a trade *deficit*, not a surplus with ASEAN. The text doesn't explicitly mention the East Asia Summit as a key forum, though it is plausible given the context.  


**10. Consider the following about  Lake Turkana:**

1. It is the largest permanent desert lake in the world.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four statements are accurate descriptions of Lake Turkana.  The Omo River is its primary water source. It holds the distinction of being the largest permanent desert lake and the fourth largest lake in Africa. Its location straddles northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  There are no misleading or incorrect elements presented as distractors; all options are true statements about Lake Turkana, making this a question testing precise recall of multiple facts.


**2. Consider the following geographical features:**

1.  Uhuru Summit

3.  Located in the African Great Lakes region
4.  The highest peak in Africa

How many of these features correctly describe Mount Kilimanjaro?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Three of the statements accurately describe Mount Kilimanjaro.  It features the Uhuru Summit, its highest point. It's a stratovolcano, formed from layers of ash, lava, and rock.  It is indeed the highest peak in Africa. However, it's crucial to note that Mount Kilimanjaro is *not* located in the African Great Lakes region; that's a separate geographical area. This question tests knowledge of specific characteristics of a well-known landmark, while carefully incorporating a plausible but incorrect distractor.


**3. Consider the following statements about the Lipulekh Pass:**

1.  It's situated in the Kali Valley.
2.  It significantly shortens travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.
3.  It's located near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Three statements are correct. The Lipulekh Pass is indeed in the Kali Valley, a major pass in the Kumaon region of Uttarakhand, and it substantially reduces the travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra. However, the pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and *Nepal*, not Bhutan. This question requires precise knowledge of the geographical location and significance of the pass, using a subtly incorrect statement to challenge the candidate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Suez Canal route:**

1. Connects the Mediterranean and Black Seas.
2. Shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.

(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Suez Canal is the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe, it is located in Egypt, and there was a recent shift in Indian fuel exports to Europe using the Cape of Good Hope route as an alternative. Statement 1 is incorrect; the Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Black Sea. This tests knowledge of both geography and recent geopolitical shifts in trade.


**5. Consider the following regarding India's bilateral relationships:**

1.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Bhutan.
2.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner.
3.  The "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" is Bhutan's highest civilian honor.

**Explanation:** Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, the Order of the Druk Gyalpo is Bhutan's highest civilian honor, and India did indeed construct the Kurichu hydroelectric project.  However, the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Nepal, not Bhutan. This question tests knowledge of specific details in India's foreign relations, using a geographically close country as a plausible distractor.


**6. Consider the following about India-Maldives relations:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives.
2.  A Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) was signed to assist the Maldives' foreign exchange reserves.
3.  The "India Out" campaign advocated for the removal of Indian military personnel.
4.  Operation Neer provided medical assistance during a crisis in the Maldives.

How many of these statements accurately reflect aspects of India-Maldives relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct.  India did launch the RuPay card in the Maldives, a Currency Swap Agreement was signed, and the "India Out" campaign did advocate for the removal of Indian military personnel. Operation Neer, however, provided *water*, not medical assistance, during a crisis.  This requires detailed knowledge of specific events and initiatives in the bilateral relationship.


**7. Consider the following regarding India-Bangladesh relations:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh project.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture, and Bangladesh did join the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative. However, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports natural gas, not crude oil. This question tests knowledge of specific projects and initiatives within the bilateral relationship.


**8. Consider the following related to India-Nepal relations:**

1. India is the largest source of FDI in Nepal.
2. The Surya Kiran exercises are joint military exercises between India and Nepal.
3. The Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950 forms the basis of the relationship.
4.  Nepal's new currency features a map including Indian territories of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of India-Nepal relations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of India-Nepal relations.  India is a major source of FDI, Surya Kiran is a joint military exercise, and the 1950 treaty is foundational.  However, while Nepal *did* introduce a new currency note with a map, the claim that the map includes specific Indian territories is a point of ongoing contention and not universally accepted as factual.  This question highlights a complex, ongoing geopolitical issue.


**9. Consider the following about the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC):**

1. It's a 7,200 km multi-modal transport network.
2. It connects India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.

How many statements accurately describe the INSTC?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct. The INSTC is a multi-modal network of approximately 7,200 km, connecting India to Russia and Europe through Central Asia and Iran, and Chabahar Port plays a crucial role. However, the INSTC was established in 2000, not 2005. This tests knowledge of a significant infrastructure project and its geopolitical implications.


**10. Consider the following concerning India-Australia relations:**

1.  Australia designated India as a ‘top-tier security partner’ in its 2024 National Defense Strategy.
2.  AUSINDEX is a joint air force exercise.
3.  The two countries signed an Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement in 2022.
4. The Murray River is Australia's longest river.

How many of the above statements correctly describe aspects of India-Australia relations or Australian geography?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Australia did designate India as a top-tier security partner, the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement was signed in 2022, and the Murray River is Australia's longest river.  However, AUSINDEX is a joint *maritime* exercise, not an air force exercise. This question combines elements of international relations and geographical knowledge, using a subtle inaccuracy in the military exercise description as a distractor.


**11. Consider the following regarding the  Pangong Tso lake:**

1. It's an endorheic lake in Ladakh.
2. It's the world's highest saltwater lake.
3.  It's partially located in China.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Pangong Tso is an endorheic lake situated in Ladakh, it is considered the world's highest saltwater lake, and a portion of it lies within Chinese territory.  However, it is *not* designated a Ramsar Site. This question tests specific characteristics of a high-altitude lake, using the Ramsar Site designation as a plausible but incorrect distractor.


**12. Consider the following regarding China:**

1. The Yangtze River is one of its major rivers.
2. The Taklimakan Desert is China's largest desert and the world's largest.
3. The Kunlunshan Mountains are located in China.

How many of these statements accurately describe geographical features of China or aspects of the India-China border?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. The Yangtze River is a major river in China, the Kunlunshan Mountains are located there, and the McMahon Line does delineate a significant portion of the India-China border in the eastern sector. However, the Taklimakan Desert, while large, is not the *world's* largest; that title belongs to Antarctica.  This question tests geographical knowledge and understanding of a complex border issue.


**13. Consider the following regarding the Chabahar Port:**

1. It's located on the Gulf of Oman.
2. It's part of a tripartite agreement between India, Iran, and Pakistan.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 3, and 4 are correct. Chabahar Port is on the Gulf of Oman, it provides a direct route to Afghanistan bypassing Pakistan, and it aligns with the INSTC. However, the tripartite agreement for its development is between India, Iran, and *Afghanistan*, not Pakistan. This question tests knowledge of a significant port project and its geopolitical significance.


**14. Consider the following features of Bangladesh:**

1. It shares a border with five Indian states.
2. The Jamuna River is its longest river.
3.  Approximately 60% of the Sundarbans mangrove forest is in Bangladesh.

(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 are correct. Bangladesh borders five Indian states, the Jamuna River is its longest, and a significant portion of the Sundarbans is within its territory. However, Bangladesh borders Myanmar to the *southeast*, not northwest.  This requires precise knowledge of Bangladesh's geographical location and borders.

Which of the above statements accurately reflect characteristics of Rwanda?

(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; Rwanda borders Uganda to its north, not west. Statement 3 is false; Rwanda is a landlocked country and does not have a coastline on the Indian Ocean. Statements 2, 4, and 5 are all accurate descriptions of Rwanda's geography, border with the DRC, capital city, and regional location.  Therefore, only option (b) correctly identifies the accurate statements.

5. It's classified as a Ramsar site.


How many of the above statements regarding Lake Turkana are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; it is the largest *permanent* desert lake, but not necessarily the largest desert lake overall. Statement 2 is correct about its location. Statement 3 is correct; the Omo River is its main source. Statement 4 is incorrect; it's Africa's fourth-largest lake. Statement 5 is incorrect;  the provided text does not indicate it is a Ramsar site. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 3) are entirely accurate, making (b) the correct answer.  The distractors play on the nuances of the descriptions to challenge accurate recall.

(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the tri-junction involves India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The remaining statements (2, 3, 4, and 5) accurately describe the Lipulekh Pass's location, significance for pilgrimage, the impact of the pandemic on trade, and its location within the Kali Valley.  Therefore, four of the five statements are correct. Option (c) is the correct answer. The incorrect statement acts as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.

CAATSA's primary focus is on countering the actions of specific adversarial nations (Russia, North Korea, and Iran) through economic sanctions for substantial dealings with them. The exemption for India regarding the S-400 purchase highlights the nuanced application of CAATSA and the potential for waivers based on strategic considerations.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while nuclear proliferation is a concern within broader US foreign policy, CAATSA's core focus is not solely on this aspect. Statement 4 is also inaccurate; CAATSA allows for the President to waive sanctions under certain circumstances, demonstrating that the application of sanctions is not automatic.

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Belarus's accession expanded the SCO's membership, and counter-terrorism cooperation is a key area of focus.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while security cooperation is important, the SCO's scope is broader, encompassing economic and cultural cooperation as well. Statement 4 is also incorrect; while India is a member, the rotating presidency is held by different member states on a yearly basis.


7. Consider the following regarding the Group of Seven (G7):

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 4 are accurate. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, joint military exercises are conducted, and the Maitree power plant is a collaborative effort. Statement 3 is incorrect;  while India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, it's not necessarily the largest in Asia.  China is likely a larger trading partner.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India was elected Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states the BIMSTEC charter came into force on May 20, 2024.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity as a major project.

Statement 3 is correct. The text lists "non-interference in internal affairs" as one of BIMSTEC's principles.

Statement 4 is incorrect. BIMSTEC addresses multiple sectors, including trade, environment, security, and agriculture, demonstrating a broader approach than solely focusing on security.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.


These MCQs demand factual recall, analysis, and the ability to differentiate between closely related concepts, aligning with the requirements of a difficult UPSC-style question.  The explanations highlight potential distractors and misconceptions, making them challenging yet fair assessments of knowledge.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, focusing on economics and geography, with detailed explanations:


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Omo River
2.  The Tsangpo River
3.  The Brahmaputra River
4.  Lake Turkana

How many of the above are directly related to the hydrological system of the Siang River?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Siang River originates in Tibet as the Tsangpo River.  Downstream, in Assam, it becomes the Brahmaputra River. The Omo River is not directly related to the Siang/Brahmaputra system. Lake Turkana is located in East Africa and is not hydrologically connected to the Siang River. Therefore, only the Tsangpo and Brahmaputra Rivers are directly linked to the Siang River's hydrological system.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding India's bilateral relations:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh engage in joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN.
3.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil.
4.  Both countries are members of SAARC, BIMSTEC, and BBIN.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  Joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN are a key aspect of their defense cooperation. Both nations are members of the mentioned multilateral platforms. However, statement 3 is incorrect; the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports refined petroleum products like diesel and kerosene, not crude oil.


**3. Consider the following features related to the India-China border dispute:**

1.  The McMahon Line
2.  The Johnson Line
3.  The McDonald Line
4.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC)

Which of the above are relevant to the demarcation of the India-China border in the Eastern Sector?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The McMahon Line is the basis for India's claim in the Eastern Sector of the India-China border, running along Arunachal Pradesh. The LAC is the de facto border, though disputed.  The Johnson and McDonald Lines are relevant to the Western Sector (Ladakh), not the Eastern Sector.


**4. Consider the following regarding the India-Nepal relationship:**

1.  The Treaty of Sagauli (1816)
2.  The River Kali
3.  The Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani areas
4.  The Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index

How many of the above are directly related to the territorial disputes between India and Nepal?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Treaty of Sagauli is crucial to understanding the origin of the dispute, as it attempted to define the border. The River Kali's source is a key point of contention, defining the boundary between the disputed areas. Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh, and Kalapani are the specific areas at the heart of the territorial disagreement. The GNH Index, while relevant to Bhutan's development philosophy, is not directly involved in the India-Nepal border dispute.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  Arun III Hydropower Project
2.  Upper Karnali Hydropower Project (UKHP)
3.  Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor

How many of the above are primarily focused on electricity generation and transmission between India and its neighbors?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Arun III and Upper Karnali are hydropower projects involving India and Nepal. The Katihar-Bornagar corridor is an electricity transmission project between India and Bangladesh. The TAPI pipeline, however, transports natural gas, not electricity.  Therefore, only three of the listed initiatives directly relate to cross-border electricity trade.


**6. Consider the following geographical features:**

1.  The Taklimakan Desert
2.  The Yangtze River
3.  The Kunlunshan Mountains
4.  The Bay of Bengal

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**8. Consider the following concerning India's relations with other countries:**

1.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP) with the UK
2.  The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) with the Maldives
3.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) exemption for India
4.  The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI)

How many of these initiatives reflect India's engagement in strengthening its diplomatic and economic ties with other nations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  All four options represent aspects of India's foreign policy aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties. The CSP with the UK signifies a high level of strategic cooperation. The CSA with the Maldives enhances financial stability. The CAATSA exemption reflects a strategic balancing act.  IPOI showcases India's engagement in the Indo-Pacific region.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
3.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a key legislative framework used by India to combat money laundering.
4. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 1990.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 3 are accurate reflections of the FATF's role and India's efforts in combating financial crimes.  The MER is indeed a crucial component of the FATF's process, assessing a nation's compliance with international standards.  India's initial MER was adopted in 2010, marking a significant step in its commitment to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. The PMLA, 2002, forms a cornerstone of India's legal framework in this area. However, statement 4 is incorrect. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004, not 1990.  This detail highlights the importance of precise factual recall in understanding the timeline of key institutions in India's fight against financial crime.  The inaccurate year serves as a strong distractor, requiring candidates to possess accurate knowledge of the FIU-IND's founding date.


**2. Consider the following regarding the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports:**

1.  Cannabis is the most abused drug globally, according to the UNODC's World Drug Day report.

3. The "Golden Triangle," now renamed the "Death Triangle," encompasses Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.
4. The UNODC's reports highlight the significant impact of drug abuse on the Triple Frontier Area, encompassing Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay.

Which of the above statements are correct?

(a) 1, 3, and 4
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect information presented in UNODC reports.  The World Drug Day report consistently identifies cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally.  The geographical regions highlighted—the Death Triangle (formerly the Golden Triangle) and the Triple Frontier Area—are indeed areas of concern regarding drug trafficking and related criminal activities, as documented by the UNODC. Statement 2 is incorrect; the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a broader scope than just Africa, encompassing global trends in wildlife crime.  The inclusion of this false statement serves as a significant distractor, requiring candidates to possess a comprehensive understanding of the UNODC's reporting activities.


**3. Consider the following about BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation):**

(c) Only three
(d) Only four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are accurate descriptions of BIMSTEC's activities and principles. The Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a key initiative, reflecting BIMSTEC's focus on regional infrastructure development.  The principles listed accurately reflect the organization's commitment to international norms and cooperation.  DMEX is a regular exercise demonstrating BIMSTEC's focus on disaster preparedness. Statement 1 is incorrect; the BIMSTEC charter came into force in May 2024, not 2023. Statement 5 is also incorrect; BIMSTEC has 7 member states, not 8. The inclusion of these incorrect statements serves as a significant distractor, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of BIMSTEC's operational facts.


**4. Consider the following statements related to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  The IMEC is intended to significantly improve connectivity between India and Southeast Asia.
2. The IMEC is expected to be a key driver of global connectivity.
3.  The IMEC was officially launched in 2023.

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 correctly describes the IMEC's anticipated role.  The IMEC is indeed projected to be a significant contributor to global connectivity by facilitating trade and investment flows across a vast geographical area.  Statements 1, 3, and 4 are incorrect. The IMEC's focus is on connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe, not Southeast Asia or Africa.  There is no mention of a specific launch date in 2023 in the given context. These incorrect statements serve as strong distractors, ensuring that the candidate needs a clear understanding of the IMEC's geographical scope and objectives.

1. Belarus recently became the 9th member of the SCO.
2. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 was endorsed at the 24th summit.
3. The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and interventions.
4. India is not a member of the SCO.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 is correct; the SCO Development Strategy until 2035 was indeed a key outcome of the 24th summit. Statement 1 is incorrect; Belarus became the 10th member, not the 9th. Statement 3 is incorrect; while security cooperation is a component of the SCO's activities, it is not solely focused on military alliances and interventions.  Its scope is far broader, encompassing economic and cultural cooperation. Statement 4 is incorrect; India is a member of the SCO. The inclusion of these incorrect statements effectively tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the SCO's membership, strategic goals, and operational realities.  The distractors are carefully chosen to test a deep understanding of the organization rather than superficial knowledge.


**6. Consider the following in relation to the Group of Seven (G7):**

1. The G7 has a permanent secretariat and headquarters.
2. India participated in the 50th G7 summit as an Outreach Country.
3. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative.
4. The G7's decisions are made by majority vote.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct.  India's participation in the 50th G7 summit as an Outreach Country is a well-documented event. The PGII is indeed a G7 initiative aimed at funding infrastructure projects in developing countries.  Statements 1 and 4 are incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating presidency sets the agenda annually.  Decisions within the G7 are made by consensus, not majority vote. The inclusion of these incorrect statements, particularly the detail about the decision-making process, requires a nuanced understanding of the G7's operational dynamics, serving as a strong distractor.


**7. Consider the following concerning the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2010.
2.  AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
3. India currently has a trade surplus with ASEAN under AITIGA.
4. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA was recently held in Jakarta.


Which of the following statements are correct?


(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 4 are accurate. AITIGA's primary objective is to reduce trade barriers and foster closer economic ties between ASEAN and India.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting taking place in Jakarta is also factually correct. Statements 1 and 3 are incorrect. AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2010.  India currently has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus.  The inclusion of these incorrect dates and the contrasting trade balance effectively differentiates between superficial and deep knowledge of AITIGA's operational details.


**8. Consider the following regarding the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC):**

1.  SAARC decisions are made by majority vote.
2. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement was signed in 2005.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 3 and 4 are correct. The establishment of the SAARC Food Bank in 2007 and the RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 are accurately reported.  Statements 1 and 2 are incorrect. SAARC decisions are made by consensus (unanimity), not majority vote. The SAFTA Agreement was signed in 2006, not 2005.  The carefully chosen distractors—the voting mechanism and the year of SAFTA's signing—require precise knowledge of SAARC's operational processes and timelines.


**9. Consider the following about the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) began operations in 2000.
2.  Atoms4Food is an IAEA program focused on improving global food security using nuclear techniques.

4.  The IAEA's main headquarters are located in Paris.

How many of the above statements are correct?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. Atoms4Food is a genuine IAEA program utilizing nuclear technology to enhance food security. The IAEA's mandate strongly emphasizes the peaceful applications of nuclear energy. Statement 1 is incorrect; the ITDB started in 1995, not 2000.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the IAEA's headquarters are in Vienna, not Paris. The incorrect dates and location effectively test the candidate's ability to recall specific details about the IAEA's operations and organizational structure, making it a challenging question.


**10. Consider the following regarding the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):**

1. The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
2.  India is categorized as a "role-modelling" country in the GCI 2024.

(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. The ITU's release of the GCI 2024 and India's classification as a "role-modelling" country are both correct. Statements 3 and 4 are incorrect. The ITU focuses on telecommunications, not air travel.  It is a specialized agency of the United Nations, not the World Bank. The inclusion of these incorrect statements effectively tests the candidate's knowledge of the ITU's core mandate and organizational affiliation, making it a challenging question.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and assesses India's legislative frameworks, institutions, and initiatives related to combating money laundering.
3.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, is a key institution involved in India's anti-money laundering efforts.
4. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating financial crimes.


How many of the above statements are accurate?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** All four statements accurately reflect aspects of the FATF and India's engagement with it.  The MER's purpose is precisely as described in statement 1. Statement 2 correctly notes the timing of India's first MER and its scope.  The ED's role in anti-money laundering is well-established, making statement 3 accurate. Finally, the MLAT portal's function and launch date are consistent with statement 4.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of these statements.


**2. Consider the following organizations and their activities:**

1. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released reports highlighting the most abused drugs globally, including cannabis, opioids, and amphetamines.

(a) 1, 2, and 3
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the UNODC's activities and reports concerning drug abuse. The UNODC does indeed release reports on global drug trends, identifying key substances and affected regions. Statement 3 is incorrect; the INCB's focus is on drug control, not nuclear material trafficking. That falls under the purview of the IAEA.  Statement 4 is accurate; the GFP is a UNODC initiative aimed at reducing illicit firearms trafficking, a key aspect of combating transnational organized crime.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**3. Consider the following features related to India's relations with Bangladesh:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh engage in military exercises such as SAMPRITI and MILAN.

How many of the above statements accurately describe aspects of India-Bangladesh relations?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect key aspects of India-Bangladesh relations. The strong trade ties, joint military exercises, and the PIWTT are all well-documented. Statement 3 is also correct; the friendship pipeline is a real project. However, statement 5 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, not India and Nepal. Therefore, four out of the five statements are accurate.


**4. Consider the following regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in "disturbed areas," allowing actions such as opening fire and searching premises without warrants.
2.  The Governor of a state, the administrator of a Union Territory, or the central government can declare an area as "disturbed."
3. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir.
4.  Legal proceedings against armed forces personnel acting under AFSPA require prior sanction from the state government.
5. The Shillong Accord (1975) is a peace accord directly addressing the implementation of AFSPA in Nagaland.

How many of the above statements correctly describe the AFSPA?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 accurately describe aspects of the AFSPA.  The act does grant special powers, the authority to declare disturbed areas rests with the entities mentioned, and the listed states are indeed where AFSPA is currently or has been in effect.  Statement 4 is incorrect; prior sanction for legal proceedings against armed forces personnel acting under AFSPA comes from the *central*, not state, government. Statement 5 is also incorrect; while the Shillong Accord aimed to bring peace to Nagaland, it didn't directly deal with the implementation of AFSPA.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements about India's international relations:**

1. India is a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
2. India's participation in the Malabar exercises demonstrates its commitment to multilateral defense cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.

(c) 2, 3, and 5
(d) 1, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 4 accurately describe aspects of India's foreign policy. India is a signatory to the CWC, reflecting its commitment to non-proliferation.  The Malabar exercises are a crucial component of India's Indo-Pacific strategy. LEMOA facilitates logistical cooperation with the US. Statement 3 is incorrect; while there have been attempts to exempt India from CAATSA sanctions, the threat of sanctions remains a factor in the relationship. Statement 5 is incorrect; the AIIB focuses on infrastructure development in developing and emerging economies, including low and middle-income countries.  Therefore, only statements 1, 2, and 4 are correct.


**6. Consider the following international organizations and their mandates:**

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the mandates or characteristics of the listed organizations?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, and 3 correctly describe the organizations. The UPU is a UN agency, OPEC+ significantly impacts oil markets, and the Five Eyes alliance is known for its intelligence sharing.  Statement 4 is incorrect; the Commonwealth operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, not a weighted voting system. Statement 5 is also inaccurate; while security cooperation is a part of the GCC's agenda, its focus extends beyond military alliances to encompass economic and political cooperation.  Therefore, only three statements are accurate.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe cross-border energy initiatives. The electricity corridors, hydropower projects, and the TAPI pipeline are all real projects.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) Only four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the state of India-US relations. India's designation as a Major Defence Partner, the 2+2 dialogue, the Malabar exercises' composition, and the goals of INDUS-X are all correct.  Statement 4 is inaccurate; while the CAATSA initially posed a challenge, the US Congress ultimately passed an amendment exempting India from sanctions for purchasing the S-400 system. Therefore, four of the five statements accurately depict elements of the relationship.


**9. Consider the following statements about the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors illicit nuclear trafficking.

**Explanation:** Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 accurately describe the ITU's activities. The GCI's release, its assessment methodology, India's ranking, and the WSIS's connection to the ITU are all correct. Statement 5 is incorrect; the ITU's focus is on telecommunications, not air travel regulation.  That falls under the purview of other international organizations. Therefore, four statements are accurate.


1. Consider the following statements regarding international organizations combating illicit activities:

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts peer reviews of countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs).

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The FATF's core function is to assess and monitor countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, using MERs as a key tool.  Statement 2 is also correct. The UNODC's reports provide crucial data on global drug trends, including identifying regions heavily affected by drug abuse and trafficking.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The CCPCJ's mandate explicitly includes combating transnational organized crime (TOC), a significant part of its work.  Statement 4 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are accurate. India is a long-standing participant in both ARF and EAS, playing an active role in regional security and economic cooperation.  India's involvement in ADMM+ and EAMF demonstrates its commitment to security and maritime cooperation within the ASEAN framework.  Statement 3 is incorrect. India's formal engagement with ASEAN started in 1992, evolving into a Dialogue Partner in 1996, a Summit-level Partner in 2002, and a Strategic Partnership in 2012.  Statement 4 is also incorrect. India generally experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN, indicating that imports from ASEAN countries exceed exports to them. Therefore, only two statements (1 and 2) are correct.

How many of the above statements correctly describe these international groupings?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

OPEC+ includes OPEC members and other major oil producers, coordinating oil production policies. Statement 4 is correct. The Five Eyes Alliance primarily focuses on intelligence sharing and security cooperation between its members (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States). Therefore, only three statements (2, 3, and 4) are accurate.


Here are some difficult multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, designed to test factual recall, analysis, and conceptual understanding, relevant to the UPSC exam pattern.  The questions are framed to include plausible distractors and require precise knowledge of the subject matter.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA):**

1. CAATSA is a US federal law enacted in 2017 that primarily targets countries engaging with North Korea.
2.  The act aims to impose economic sanctions on nations with significant dealings with Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
3.  An amendment exempting India from CAATSA sanctions regarding the S-400 missile system purchase was passed by the US Senate.
4. CAATSA sanctions are exclusively focused on military equipment transactions.


Which of the statements above are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 accurately describes the core purpose of CAATSA: to sanction countries engaging deeply with Russia, Iran, and North Korea.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while North Korea is a target, the act's scope is broader, encompassing Russia and Iran as well. Statement 3 is incorrect because the amendment exempting India from sanctions concerning the S-400 purchase was passed by the US House of Representatives, not the Senate. Statement 4 is also incorrect; CAATSA's sanctions extend beyond purely military transactions to encompass a wider range of economic engagements.  Therefore, only statement 2 correctly reflects the factual aspects of CAATSA.


**2. Consider the following regarding India's measures to combat money laundering:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) was enacted in 2000.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2002.

How many of the above statements are factually accurate?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the PMLA was enacted in 2002, not 2000. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 2002. Statement 3 is correct; the ED was established in 1956, significantly earlier than the FIU-IND. Statement 4 is incorrect because the MLAT Portal aims to enhance international cooperation, not solely domestic efforts. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.


**3. Consider the following features of the United Kingdom:**

1.  The UK shares a land boundary with France.
2.  Northern Ireland is one of the four constituent countries of the UK.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the UK shares a land border with Ireland, not France. Statement 2 is correct; the UK comprises England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Statement 3 is correct; the Pennines are located in England. Statement 4 is incorrect; while the Thames is a significant river, the UK's longest river is actually the Severn.

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the BIMSTEC charter came into force in 2024, not 2023.  Statement 2 is correct; Nepal's ratification was indeed the final step needed for the charter's implementation. Statement 3 is also correct; the transport connectivity plan is a key BIMSTEC project. Statement 4 is incorrect; BIMSTEC includes both South and Southeast Asian nations.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate descriptions of BIMSTEC.


**5. Consider the following regarding India-US defense cooperation:**

1. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.
2.  India is designated as a Major Defence Partner of the US.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; LEMOA was signed in 2016, not 2018. Statement 2 is correct; India holds the Major Defence Partner designation. Statement 3 is correct; the Malabar exercises involve the four nations mentioned. Statement 4 is also correct; COMCASA indeed improves communication system interoperability.

4. The Shillong Accord (1975) played a role in shaping the application of AFSPA in Nagaland.


Which of the above statements concerning AFSPA are correct?

(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; AFSPA empowers the armed forces in disturbed areas, as declared by the central government, not the state government. Statement 2 is incorrect; AFSPA remains in effect in parts of Arunachal Pradesh. Statement 3 is incorrect; prior sanction for legal proceedings against armed forces personnel under AFSPA comes from the central government, not the state government. Statement 4 is largely correct; the Shillong Accord influenced the application of AFSPA in Nagaland, although the relationship is complex and not solely about AFSPA's direct implementation. Therefore, only statements 1 and 4 are substantially accurate representations of AFSPA.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, not the World Bank. Statement 2 is correct; FATF's core function is the mutual evaluation of anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. Statement 3 is incorrect; OPEC+ includes both oil-producing and non-producing countries to influence global oil markets. Statement 4 is incorrect; while AIIB's primary focus is on Asian infrastructure, it also considers projects outside the region under certain circumstances. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**8. Consider the following about the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC):**

(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; India is indeed a signatory to and a party of the CWC. Statement 2 correctly describes the CWC's core purpose. Statement 3 is also correct; the CWC was adopted in 1993.

(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements accurately describe aspects of the India-Bangladesh relationship.  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia; the Maitree power plant represents collaboration between the two countries; Bangladesh shares borders with five, not six, Indian states (though the question is designed to be tricky); and the PIWTT is a significant initiative for improved connectivity. Therefore, all four statements are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Commonwealth is headed by the British monarch, not a rotating chairperson. Statement 2 is correct; India did host the Commonwealth Games in 2010. Statement 3 is incorrect; Barbados removed the British monarch as its head of state in 2021, not 2022. Statement 4 is incorrect; the CLGF is headquartered in London, UK, not New Delhi.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.


**1. Consider the following:**

3.  Mexico
4.  Honduras

Which of the above countries share a land border with the USA?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The United States shares a land border with only two Central American countries: Mexico to the southwest and Canada to the north. Belize and Guatemala are also located in Central America, but they do not share a land border with the USA.  Honduras is further south and also does not share a land border. Therefore, only Belize and Guatemala share a land border with the USA.  Option (a) accurately reflects this. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include countries that do not share a land border with the United States.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding Bolivia's economic situation:**

1.  It is heavily reliant on the U.S. dollar.

(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The provided text explicitly states that Bolivia is experiencing economic turmoil due to its dependence on the U.S. dollar, depleting reserves, and rising debts.  These three factors (statements 1, 2, and 3) are all correctly identified as contributing to Bolivia's economic challenges. Statement 4 is a distractor; while Bolivia has natural resources, it's not primarily known for significant petroleum exports, making it an incorrect statement in the context of its current economic woes.  Therefore, all three of the accurate statements make option (c) the correct answer.


**3. Consider the following regarding Panama's geographic location:**

1.  It is located on the Isthmus of Panama.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text correctly identifies Panama's location on the Isthmus of Panama (1), its border with Costa Rica to the *west* (not east, making 2 incorrect), and its maritime boundary with the Caribbean Sea (3).  Statement 4 is incorrect; Panama borders Colombia to the east and Costa Rica to the west, but not Nicaragua. Therefore, only three statements (1, 3 and the corrected 2) are accurate, making (c) the correct option.


**4. Consider the following about Trinidad and Tobago:**

1.  It is an island nation in the southeastern West Indies.
2.  It is located close to South America.

**Explanation:**  The passage correctly states that Trinidad and Tobago is an island nation in the southeastern West Indies (1) and is located near South America (2).  It also correctly notes the adoption of India's UPI system (4). However, statement 3 is incorrect; Trinidad and Tobago doesn't share a land border with Guyana. It is located northeast of Venezuela and northwest of Guyana, but separated by water.  Therefore, three statements are correct, making (c) the right answer.


**5. Consider the following regarding New Zealand:**

1.  It is located between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The Yangtze River (1) and the Taklamakan Desert (2) are both explicitly mentioned in the text as being in China.  While the Gobi Desert (4) extends into China, it is not exclusively within its borders.  The Himalayas (3) are a vast mountain range, but the text doesn't specify which parts are within China's boundaries.  Therefore, only the Yangtze River and Taklamakan Desert are definitively stated as being within China. The Gobi desert is partially within China.  Therefore, only three are definitively within China, making (c) correct.

(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:** The text correctly identifies the Treaty of Sagauli (1816) and the Kali River's location as key elements of the dispute (1 and 2).  It also mentions Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh (3). However, statement 4 is inaccurate; the dispute also involves a tri-junction with Tibet (China). Thus, three statements accurately reflect aspects of the India-Nepal border dispute. (c) is the correct option.

(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  China's position as India's largest trading partner in goods is a well-established fact in recent years, though it also represents a significant trade deficit for India.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The LAC is a disputed boundary, and there is no formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon line.  The lack of a formally defined border is a major source of tension between the two countries.

Statement 3 is correct. The Galwan clash of 2020 resulted in significant casualties on both sides, marking it as the most serious border incident since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

Statement 4 is correct. The Depsang Plains' strategic location near the Karakoram Pass makes them a crucial area for military operations and control, highlighting the geopolitical significance of this region.


**2. Consider the following regarding the India-Nepal border dispute:**

1. The Treaty of Sagauli (1816) is central to the Kalapani border dispute.
2. Nepal claims that the River Kali originates west of Kalapani.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Suez Canal is a crucial maritime route connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The Cape of Good Hope is a significant navigational point at the southern tip of Africa.  The Kaladan River, though not strictly a maritime route, is relevant to trade and transit opportunities through the Sittwe port.  The Lipulekh Pass is a land route, not directly a maritime or trade route in the same sense as the others.  Therefore, three of the options are relevant to maritime or trade routes.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  Lake Turkana's water source is the Omo River.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Kenya.
3.  The Lipulekh pass facilitates travel to the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2, 3, and 4 are correct. The Chagos Islands are indeed located south of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Rwanda shares a border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Togo's southern border is formed by the Gulf of Guinea, a part of the Atlantic Ocean. However, statement 1 is incorrect; Mauritius is located to the *east* of Madagascar.  This question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific geographical locations and to identify subtle errors in seemingly plausible statements. The option choices are crafted to make the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge rather than general understanding.

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements are correct. India and Australia indeed have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, signifying strong bilateral ties. Japan's Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP) strategy and India's Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) share significant alignment. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline aims to transport natural gas through these countries.  Finally, the Maldives archipelago is composed of numerous natural atolls.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) indeed focuses on tracking illicit nuclear material. Operation Sadbhav is primarily an Indian Army initiative for civic action within India.  However, statement 2 is partially incorrect; while the ITU does release a Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), its primary focus isn't solely on national cybersecurity but broader telecommunication aspects. Statement 4 is also incorrect; the Colombo Process primarily addresses migration management, not solely maritime security. This question tests the candidate's understanding of international organizations and their respective mandates, emphasizing the need for nuanced knowledge.  The options are designed to challenge the candidate's ability to correctly identify the primary functions of these organizations amidst plausible distractors.

How many of the above are G7-led initiatives aimed at addressing global challenges beyond traditional economic cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five initiatives listed are indeed G7-led efforts, each tackling distinct global challenges.  The PGII focuses on infrastructure development in developing nations, aligning with sustainable development goals. "Energy for Growth in Africa" directly targets energy access and clean energy transition in Africa. The FSOI addresses the sustainability and health of oceans. The Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to manage global energy prices and stabilize markets. Finally, Apulia Food Systems focuses on enhancing food security and sustainable agriculture. These initiatives showcase the G7's expanded role beyond traditional economic matters, encompassing sustainable development, energy security, environmental protection, and food security.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, 3, and 4 correctly describe facets of NAM and its stance on the US list. NAM's advocacy for Cuba's removal underscores its commitment to the Global South. The US list's coercive measures are accurately described. The inclusion of North Korea, Iran, and Syria is a factual representation of the list's composition.  NAM's support for Cuba reflects its importance to Global South nations.  Statement 5 is incorrect. While NAM originated with a focus on military non-alignment during the Cold War, its contemporary role encompasses a broader range of issues concerning the interests of developing nations, including economic justice, human rights, and global governance. Options (a) and (c) are incomplete, while (d) is incorrect due to the inaccurate statement about NAM's primary focus.

(c) Only 1 and 2
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1, 2, and 5 accurately reflect aspects of the SCO. Belarus's membership is a recent development.  The counter-terrorism program is a key initiative.  The endorsement of the "World Unity" initiative is also factual. Statement 3 is incorrect; while security cooperation is important, the SCO's focus extends to economic, cultural, and other areas. Statement 4 is incorrect; India is not a founding member; it joined later. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incomplete or inaccurate.

**1. Consider the following initiatives related to global infrastructure development:**

1.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)
4.  The Apulia Food Systems initiative

Which of the above initiatives primarily focus on sustainable infrastructure development in developing nations?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The PGII explicitly aims to mobilize funding for sustainable infrastructure projects in developing countries.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative directly targets clean energy projects, a key component of sustainable development.  While the FSOI and Apulia Food Systems initiatives contribute to sustainable development goals, their primary focus is not on infrastructure development in the same direct manner as the PGII and the Africa energy initiative.  Option (a) accurately reflects the initiatives directly related to sustainable infrastructure. Options (b), (c), and (d) include initiatives with broader sustainable development focuses, but not solely on infrastructure.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM):**

1.  NAM advocates for the removal of Cuba from the US's unilateral list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.

(c) All three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four statements correctly describe aspects of NAM's position and the context of the US's unilateral list.  NAM's advocacy for Cuba highlights its concern for the Global South, and the US's sanctions illustrate the significant consequences of being included on this list.  The inclusion of other countries like North Korea, Iran, and Syria further contextualizes the issue. Option (d) is the only option that encompasses all these factual elements.


**3. Consider the following features of India's relationship with the Commonwealth:**

1.  India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing a significant portion of its total population.
2.  India is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth's budget.
3.  India has hosted major Commonwealth events such as the CHOGM and Commonwealth Games.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect the nature of India's engagement with the Commonwealth?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While India is a large member of the Commonwealth, it is not the largest financial contributor.  Statements 1, 3, and 4 accurately represent aspects of India’s engagement.  Statement 2 is factually incorrect, making options (a), (b), and (d) incorrect. Option (c) correctly identifies the three accurate statements.


**4. Consider the following international organizations and their initiatives:**

1.  The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
2.  The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)
3.  The Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network
4.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)

Which of the above organizations are directly involved in combating transnational organized crime or related issues?

(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four organizations are involved in combating transnational organized crime or related issues.  The INCB focuses on drug control, the CCPCJ addresses crime prevention and criminal justice, GLOBE tackles corruption, and UNODC has a broad mandate covering drugs and crime, including transnational organized crime. Option (c) accurately reflects the involvement of all four organizations.


**5. Consider the following aspects of the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1.  The IMEC is intended to enhance regional connectivity.
2.  The IMEC is primarily a maritime trade route.
3.  The IMEC is expected to boost trade and economic cooperation between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
4.  The IMEC’s development is solely driven by the Indian government.


How many of the above statements accurately describe the IMEC and its potential impact?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IMEC aims to improve connectivity, stimulate trade, and foster economic cooperation among the three regions. While it may utilize maritime routes, it’s not solely a maritime initiative. The IMEC's development involves multiple stakeholders, not just India. Therefore, statements 1, 3, are accurate, while 2 and 4 are not entirely accurate or misleading.  Option (c) is the correct answer.


**6. Consider the following organizations and their key activities:**

1.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)

Which of the above organizations have a primary focus on regional cooperation and economic development within their respective geographical areas?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The SCO, ASEAN, and BIMSTEC are primarily focused on regional cooperation and economic development within their respective geographic regions.  The G7, while involved in global economic issues, is not primarily focused on regional cooperation in a specific geographic area in the same way as the other three. Therefore, Option (c) is correct.


**7. Consider the following agreements and initiatives related to regional cooperation in South Asia:**

1.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)
2.  The SAARC Currency Swap Framework
3.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement
4.  The BIMSTEC Charter

How many of the above are primarily focused on economic cooperation within South Asia?


(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

SAARC, SAFTA, and the BIMSTEC Charter all have economic cooperation as a central goal. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework is a specific initiative under SAARC aimed at economic stability. Thus, all four options are correct.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding India's participation in international forums:**

4.  The India-UK Technology Security Initiative (TSI)

How many of the above agreements primarily aim to address transnational crime or enhance security cooperation?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

UNTOC and the SAARC Convention directly address transnational crime. AITIGA and TSI are focused on trade and technology cooperation, respectively, not primarily on crime prevention or security cooperation.  Therefore, only two of the listed agreements directly aim to address transnational crime or enhance security cooperation.


**10. Consider the following reports and their publishing organizations:**

1.  The "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific"
2.  The "World Military Expenditure" report
3.  The "Trade & Development Report"
4.  The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, focusing on economics and international relations, designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge.  Each question includes a detailed explanation.


**1. Consider the following:**

1.  The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF)
2.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
3.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
4.  The Group of Seven (G7)

Which of the above initiatives primarily focuses on strengthening critical supply chains through a dedicated council?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The IPEF, through its Supply Chain Council, directly addresses the strengthening of critical supply chains.  IMEC focuses on connectivity, the SCO on broader security and economic cooperation, and the G7 on global economic governance and various initiatives, but not specifically on supply chain strengthening in a dedicated council format.  While supply chains may be indirectly impacted by the other initiatives, the question specifically asks about the primary focus.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include initiatives that do not have a dedicated council for supply chain strengthening as a primary focus.


**2. Consider the following statements regarding the India-Bangladesh relationship:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  India and Bangladesh participate in joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN.
3.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative energy project between the two countries.
4.  Bangladesh has joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.

How many of the above statements accurately reflect aspects of the India-Bangladesh relationship?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

Finally, Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative reflects its engagement with India's regional strategy. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in the provided statements.


**3. Consider the following statements about international organizations:**

1.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) operates an Incident and Trafficking Database to monitor illicit nuclear material.
2.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
3.  The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is involved in counter-narcotics operations in the Arabian Sea.
4.  The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) includes a dedicated forum focusing on political and security issues, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF).


How many of these statements accurately describe the activities or functions of the mentioned international organizations?

(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:** Each statement accurately reflects the work of the respective organization. The IAEA maintains a database on nuclear material trafficking. The ITU publishes the GCI. The CMF conducts maritime security operations, including counter-narcotics efforts.  The ARF is a key ASEAN mechanism for political and security dialogue.  All four statements correctly describe the activities of the named organizations, leaving no room for incorrect options.


**4. Consider the following:**

1.  The RuPay card launch in the Maldives
2.  The Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives
3.  India's construction of a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll
4.  India's support for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs) in the Maldives

Which of the above initiatives primarily aim at enhancing the financial stability and liquidity of the Maldivian economy?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:** The RuPay card expansion and the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) directly address the Maldivian economy's financial stability and liquidity.  The Coast Guard base and HICDPs are important for security and development but are not the primary tools for enhancing financial stability and liquidity.  The other options incorrectly include initiatives that, while beneficial to the Maldives, do not directly focus on economic stability and liquidity in the same way as the RuPay card and the CSA.


**5. Consider the following initiatives related to regional economic cooperation:**

1.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)
2.  The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) Currency Swap Framework
3.  The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay
4.  The  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)

Which of the above initiatives directly aims to reduce trade barriers between India and a specific regional bloc?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:** The AITIGA specifically targets reducing trade barriers between India and the ASEAN countries. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework deals with financial cooperation within South Asia, the BCBPI focuses on payments within BRICS nations, and the PGII is a broader global infrastructure initiative. Only AITIGA directly addresses trade barrier reduction between India and a specific regional bloc.  The other options either focus on different types of cooperation or involve different geographical scopes.
