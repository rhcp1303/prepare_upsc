    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched based on the provided text.  Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative signifies its growing engagement with India's regional strategy.  The launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives represents an expansion of India's financial footprint and strengthens economic ties.  Both Bhutan and Nepal have ongoing hydropower projects with India, indicating the significance of energy cooperation in bilateral relations.  The Kurichu and Arun III projects are explicitly mentioned as examples of India's energy collaborations with these countries, respectively.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and do not encompass the full range of correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following pairs:**

Therefore, option (d) is the correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**6. With reference to the Maldives, consider the following pairs:**

    Geographic Feature           Description
    1. Atolls                     :   Natural formations composing the Maldives
    2.  Surrounding Ocean          :   Indian Ocean
    3.  8 Degree Channel           :   Separates Minicoy Island from the Maldives
    4.  Capital City               :   Male

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 1 and 2 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text confirms that the Maldives is composed of natural atolls, is surrounded by the Indian Ocean, has Male as its capital city, and the 8 Degree Channel separates Minicoy Island from the Maldives.  All four pairs are accurately matched.  Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.

    (b) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The text describes disengagement in the Depsang Plains area as a recent development in India-China relations, a currency swap agreement with the Maldives, and a cross-border electricity trade pact with Nepal. Operation Neer is not directly tied to Bhutan in the provided text.  Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct choice. Options (a), (c), and (d) either incorrectly include pair 3 or exclude a correctly matched pair.


**8. With reference to international organizations and India's role, consider the following pairs:**

    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions India's achievement of an 'Outstanding Outcome' in the FATF's Mutual Evaluation, its status as the highest contributor to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, the re-election of Jagjit Pavadia to INCB, and India chairing its first meeting of the Colombo Process. All four pairs are correctly matched. Option (c) accurately reflects this. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and do not include all the correctly matched pairs.


**9. With reference to conflict zones and their characteristics, consider the following pairs:**

    Conflict Zone                Primary Contending Factions
    1.  Southern Thailand       :   Thai government vs. Malay-Muslim separatists
    2.  West Papua (Indonesia)   :   Indonesian government vs. Free Papua Movement (OPM)
    3.  Mindanao (Philippines)  :   Philippine government vs. MILF
    4.  Kachin State (Myanmar)   :   Myanmar military vs. Kachin Independence Army (KIA)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly identifies the primary contending factions in each of the listed conflict zones: Southern Thailand (Thai government vs. Malay-Muslim separatists), West Papua (Indonesian government vs. Free Papua Movement), Mindanao (Philippine government vs. MILF), and Kachin State (Myanmar military vs. KIA).  All four pairs accurately reflect the information provided. Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete.


**10. With reference to countries in Central and Southeast Asia, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                      Geographic Feature/Bordering Country
    1. Iran                        :   Borders Afghanistan
    2. Uzbekistan                  :   Borders Tajikistan
    3. Thailand                    :   Borders Laos
    4. Philippines                 :   Borders Vietnam

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text indicates that Iran shares a border with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan borders Tajikistan, and Thailand borders Laos.  However, the Philippines does not border Vietnam; they are separated by the South China Sea. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) accurately reflects this. Options (b), (c), and (d) either include the incorrect pair 4 or exclude a correctly matched pair.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Major Trading Partner (Goods)
1. India                          :   China
2. Bangladesh                    :   India
3. Bhutan                         :   China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that India's largest trading partner in goods (as of 2023) is China is accurate, reflecting a significant trade relationship and substantial trade volume between the two nations.  This is a widely reported fact in international trade statistics.  Bangladesh's status as India's biggest trade partner in South Asia is also factually correct, highlighting the strong economic ties between the two neighboring countries.  However, Bhutan's largest trading partner is India, not China.  While Bhutan does trade with China, its economic relationship with India is far more substantial and deeply entrenched due to historical ties, geographical proximity, and extensive development cooperation.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the correct matching of India and China, ignoring the correct pairing of Bangladesh and India. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes the correct pairing of Bangladesh and India, neglecting the correct pairing of India and China. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Bhutan and China.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Hydroelectric Project
1. Bhutan                         :   Arun III
2. Bhutan                         :   Kurichu
3. Nepal                          :   Mangdechhu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Kurichu is indeed a major hydroelectric project constructed in Bhutan with Indian collaboration, supplying electricity to India.  This is a well-documented fact in the context of India-Bhutan energy cooperation.  However, Arun III is a hydroelectric project located in Nepal, not Bhutan.  Similarly, Mangdechhu is another hydroelectric project in Bhutan, but not mentioned in the provided context. The inclusion of Arun III and Mangdechhu as projects in Bhutan serves as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of regional hydroelectric projects. Option (a) is incorrect as it incorrectly links Arun III to Bhutan. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Arun III and Bhutan. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Mangdechhu and Nepal.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      International Initiative
1. Bangladesh                    :   Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative
2. Nepal                          :   International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)
3. Maldives                       :   International Solar Alliance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a well-established fact, signifying its engagement with regional cooperative frameworks.  The INSTC, however, primarily involves India, Iran, and Russia, with Nepal not being a core participant.  Similarly, while Nepal has expressed interest in joining the International Solar Alliance, its formal membership is not definitively confirmed within the given context. The inclusion of Nepal and Maldives with incorrect initiatives acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of various international collaborations. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include the incorrect pairing of Nepal and INSTC and/or Maldives and the International Solar Alliance.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                             Country
1. Jamuna                           :   Nepal
2. Amo Chu                          :   Bhutan
3. Manas River                       :   Bhutan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Amo Chu River, which flows into West Bengal (India) and is known as the Torsa, and the Manas River, which flows into Assam (India), are both located within Bhutan. This is geographically accurate information.  However, the Jamuna River, a part of the Brahmaputra, is primarily located in Bangladesh, not Nepal.  The inclusion of the Jamuna River with Nepal serves as a significant distractor to test the candidate's knowledge of South Asian rivers.  Option (a) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Jamuna and Nepal. Option (c) is incorrect as it only includes the correctly matched Manas River and excludes the correctly matched Amo Chu. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Jamuna and Nepal.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                       Significant Feature
1. Maldives                       :   Located in the Bay of Bengal
2. Bhutan                         :   World's first carbon-negative country
3. Nepal                          :   Shares a border with five Indian states

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bhutan's status as the world's first carbon-negative country is a widely recognized fact, reflecting its commitment to environmental sustainability.  This showcases its unique approach to development indicators.  However, Maldives is located in the Indian Ocean, not the Bay of Bengal.  Nepal does indeed share a border with five Indian states, but the inclusion of Maldives and incorrect location and the combination of Nepal and Bhutan in other options are plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of South Asian geography.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched pair of Maldives and the Bay of Bengal.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Entity                                  Attribute
1. Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions    :   Long-term financing to priority sectors
2. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in FY24 :   Singapore was the top source of FDI equity inflows
3.  "International" currency           :   Widely used within the borders of its issuing country
4. India's gold reserves                 :   Primarily stored in the Bank of England
5. Debt-to-GDP ratio for India           :   Rangarajan Committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the second pair is correctly matched.  Variable Rate Repo (VRR) auctions are a monetary policy tool used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to inject short-term liquidity into the banking system, not for long-term financing.  Singapore was indeed the top source of FDI equity inflows into India in FY24. A currency is considered "international" if it's widely accepted as a medium of exchange outside its country of origin, not within. India's gold reserves are primarily held by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), not the Bank of England. Finally, the NK Singh Committee, not the Rangarajan Committee,  envisaged a specific debt-to-GDP ratio for the central and state governments in India.  The other options incorrectly include pairs that are factually inaccurate based on established economic principles and current data on India's economy.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                                 Description
1.  Preston Curve                           :   Measures inequality in frequency distributions
2.  Clearing Corporation (CC) primary function:   Setting interest rates for commercial bank loans
3.  Repo Rate                               :   Interest rate RBI charges commercial banks for borrowing
4.  Central Board of Indirect Taxes & Customs (CBIC):   Under the Ministry of Home Affairs
5.  India's public debt-to-GDP ratio in 2022-23:   21%


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only the first pair is correctly matched.  The Preston Curve depicts the empirical relationship between life expectancy and per capita income.  Clearing Corporations do not set interest rates; that's the function of the central bank. The repo rate is the interest rate at which the RBI lends money to commercial banks, not charges them.  The CBIC is under the Ministry of Finance. While India's public debt figures fluctuate, the 21% figure for 2022-23 is not accurate. The other options incorrectly pair concepts with inaccurate or misleading descriptions, demonstrating a misunderstanding of fundamental economic concepts and current Indian economic data.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                       Key Feature of Bilateral Relations
1. Bangladesh                   :   India's smallest trade partner in South Asia
2. China                         :   India has a significant trade surplus with China
3. Nepal                         :   India is the lowest source of FDI in Nepal
4. Bhutan                        :   Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed in 1949, renewed in 2007
5. Maldives                      :   India is building a new Air Force base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 4 is correctly matched.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, not the smallest. India has a significant trade deficit with China, not a surplus.  India is the highest source of FDI in Nepal, not the lowest.  The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan was indeed signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007. India is building a Coast Guard base, not an Air Force base, at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll in the Maldives. The other options contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, showcasing a lack of accurate knowledge of India's key bilateral relationships.


**4. With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative            Characteristic
1.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)  :   India's Jagjit Pavadia was elected for a single term (2025-2030)
2.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) :   Launched the "Generation Justice" initiative
3.  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network :   India is a member of its steering committee
4.  BIMSTEC Charter                   :   Came into force before May 20, 2024
5.  Quad Leaders’ Summit, Wilmington  :  Adopted the "Wilmington Accord"


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only



**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB was for a third term, not a single term. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force on May 20, 2024. The Quad Leaders’ Summit in Wilmington adopted the "Wilmington Declaration," not the "Wilmington Accord."  The other options contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, indicating a lack of familiarity with the details of these organizations and initiatives.  The question tests factual recall and attention to detail, crucial skills for UPSC aspirants.


**5. With reference to geographical locations and events, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                           Event/Feature
1. Lake Turkana                      :   Second largest permanent desert lake in the world
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                  :   Located in Kenya
3. Lipulekh Pass                      :   Located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan
4. Suez Canal                         :   Connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean
5. Chabahar Port                      :   Located on the Gulf of Oman


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 5 is correctly matched. Lake Turkana is the largest permanent desert lake in the world, not the second largest. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. Lipulekh Pass is at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Chabahar Port is indeed located on the Gulf of Oman.  The other options contain several incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of geographical knowledge and attention to detail.  This question tests both factual recall and the ability to identify inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Activity/Initiative
1. IPEF’s Supply Chain Council             :   Launched Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
2. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Released Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)   :   Endorsed the Initiative ‘On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development’
4.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)      :   Monitors illicit nuclear trafficking through Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
5.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)             :   Adopted Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) did indeed endorse the Initiative ‘On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development’ at its 24th summit.  The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is accurately paired with its 150th-anniversary commemoration through the release of commemorative postage stamps.  Let's examine why the other pairs are incorrect:

* **Pair 1:** The IPEF’s Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, not launching the PGII. The PGII is an initiative of the G7.

* **Pair 2:** The IAEA is involved in nuclear technology and safety, not cybersecurity indices. The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 was released by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

* **Pair 4:** The FATF's primary function is assessing measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) is an initiative of the IAEA.


The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their specific roles, requiring precise recall of their activities.  The incorrect pairings involve organizations with related but distinct mandates, making the question challenging and requiring a high degree of accuracy.


**2. With reference to international collaborations, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                     Participating Entities
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  Includes Russia and the United States
2.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)              :  India participated in Operation Crimson Barracuda
3.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):  A cornerstone of global connectivity according to the Minister of External Affairs
4.  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) : RBI announces SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027
5.  Five Eyes Alliance                          :   Australia allows non-citizen residents from the alliance to join its armed forces


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because pairs 3, 4, and 5 represent accurate pairings. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is indeed presented as a cornerstone of global connectivity by the Minister of External Affairs. The RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework is factually correct, and Australia's decision regarding non-citizen residents from the Five Eyes Alliance joining its armed forces is also accurate. Let's analyze the incorrect pairs:

* **Pair 1:** AITIGA involves ASEAN member states and India; it does not include Russia or the United States.

* **Pair 2:** While India did participate in Operation Crimson Barracuda, this operation was conducted under the Combined Task Force-150, a component of the CMF, not the CMF itself.


The question's design uses plausible distractors, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related concepts within international relations.  The incorrect options present realistic-sounding but ultimately false connections, enhancing the question's difficulty level and requiring in-depth knowledge of international organizations and agreements.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Specific Feature of Relationship
1. China                                      :   India has a significant trade surplus
2. Bangladesh                               :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project
3.  United States                             :   Designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016
4.  United Kingdom                           :   India is the UK's largest trading partner
5. Nepal                                      :   Upcoming Electricity corridor from Katihar to Bornagar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) as only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, accurately reflecting a facet of their bilateral relationship. The United States' designation of India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016 is also accurate. Now, let's address the incorrect pairings:


* **Pair 1:** India has a significant trade deficit with China, not a surplus.

* **Pair 4:** India is a significant trading partner for the UK, but not the largest.

* **Pair 5:** The electricity corridor mentioned connects Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in Assam, an internal Indian project, not a bilateral initiative with Nepal.


This question tests knowledge of specific details within India's bilateral relationships, going beyond broad generalizations. The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as mentioning a significant trading partner but getting the trade balance wrong, significantly increases the difficulty level and necessitates precise factual recall.  The question effectively assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate statements concerning India's foreign policy engagements.


**4. With reference to international conventions and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Convention/Organization                      Key Feature/Action
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention                  :   India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :   Released two key reports on World Drug Day
3.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ):  Launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
4.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC):  India is not a signatory
5.  GlobE Network                               :   India elected to its steering committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). Pairs 1, 3, and 5 represent accurate pairings. India did enact the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, in compliance with the Chemical Weapons Convention. The CCPCJ accurately launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative.  India's election to the GlobE Network's steering committee is also correct. Now, let's analyze the incorrect pairings:


* **Pair 2:** The UNODC, not the INCB, released the reports mentioned.

* **Pair 4:**  India *is* a signatory to the UNTOC (Palermo Convention).


The question requires detailed knowledge of international conventions and organizations, testing recall and understanding of their functions and India's engagement with them.  The presence of closely related but ultimately incorrect options elevates the difficulty level, demanding precise factual recall rather than superficial understanding.  This question effectively evaluates the candidate's understanding of international legal frameworks and their implementation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative          Key Feature/Initiative
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for assessing money laundering and terrorist financing measures
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   World Drug Day Report highlighting most abused drugs globally
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
4. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) : Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The UNODC publishes the annual World Drug Day Report, providing global data on drug abuse trends. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative to engage youth in crime prevention.  However, the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is an initiative of the UNODC, not the INCB. The INCB focuses on monitoring and controlling the production and trade of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention                 Related Focus Area
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Combating illicit nuclear trafficking
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)               :   Prohibition of development and use of biological weapons
3. Biological Weapons Convention                     :   Banning the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
4.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)   :  Reducing trade barriers between ASEAN and India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is correctly matched with its objective of reducing trade barriers and deepening economic ties between ASEAN and India.  However, the other pairings are incorrect. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) focuses on transnational organized crime, not illicit nuclear trafficking (that falls under the IAEA's purview). The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) bans chemical weapons, not biological weapons (which are covered by the Biological Weapons Convention). The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional/International Grouping/Initiative           Key Characteristic/Outcome
1.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)          :  Belarus's recent accession as a member state
2. Group of Seven (G7)                               :  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
3.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Focus on strengthening critical supply chains
4.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)           :  Establishment of a Crisis Response Network


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Belarus joining the SCO and the G7's PGII initiative are accurately paired. The IPEF established a Crisis Response Network as part of its supply chain agreement.  However, the IMEC's focus is on global connectivity, not specifically strengthening supply chains (that's an IPEF function).  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agency                                 Specific Function/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)           :   Atoms4Food program for improving global food security
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)        :    Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)                   :    Operation Crimson Barracuda for drug seizure
4. Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) :   World Military Expenditure Report


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program uses nuclear techniques to enhance food security. The ITU publishes the Global Cybersecurity Index. The CMF, of which the Indian Navy is a part, conducted Operation Crimson Barracuda, resulting in a drug seizure. SIPRI is indeed the publisher of the World Military Expenditure Report.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                  Specific Provision/Outcome
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal launch
3.  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)                   :  Facilitates exchange of currencies at a set rate
4.  Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) :   India-Singapore trade agreement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA is associated with the establishment of the FIU-IND. CSAs involve exchanging currencies at agreed rates. The CECA is a trade agreement between India and Singapore. However, the UAPA is not directly linked to the launch of the MLAT Portal; while the UAPA deals with unlawful activities, the MLAT Portal is a separate initiative enhancing international cooperation. Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. With reference to India's international economic engagements, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                     Specific Feature/Outcome
    1. IPEF Supply Chain Council              :   India elected as Chair
    2. IMEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor) :   Focuses primarily on enhancing intra-African trade
    3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)  :   Belarus's membership increased the total number of member states to ten
    4. G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :   Aims to mobilize $300 billion by 2027

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pairs 1 and 3 are accurately matched.  The IPEF Supply Chain Council did indeed elect India as Vice-Chair, not Chair, reflecting India's growing role in global supply chain management and its strategic partnerships in the Indo-Pacific region. This highlights India's commitment to resilient and secure supply chains, a crucial aspect of its economic diplomacy.  The SCO did welcome Belarus as its tenth member, expanding the organization's geographical reach and influence.  This demonstrates the SCO's evolving role in regional security and economic cooperation.

Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 1. Option (c) is incorrect because pair 4 is wrongly matched. The PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion, not $300 billion, by 2027, underscoring the scale of global infrastructure investment needed to support sustainable development.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the mismatched pairs 2 and 4.  IMEC's focus is on global connectivity, linking India, the Middle East, and Europe, not primarily on intra-African trade. This illustrates the complexity of international economic corridors and their potential to reshape global trade flows.


**2. With reference to India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures, consider the following pairs:**

    Legislation/Institution                    Function/Establishment Year
    1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002  :  Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
    2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :  Primarily focuses on combating drug trafficking
    3. Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)   :  Established in 2004
    4. Directorate of Enforcement (ED)             :  Established in 1956


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 3 and 4 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was indeed established in 2004, playing a vital role in gathering and analyzing financial intelligence to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established in 1956 and continues to be a key agency in enforcing economic laws and combating financial crimes.  This demonstrates the evolution of India's financial regulatory framework and its capacity to adapt to emerging threats.

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include mismatched pairs. PMLA, 2002, is a crucial piece of legislation for preventing money laundering, but it did not establish the FIU-IND; that was a separate governmental action.  The UAPA, 1967, primarily addresses unlawful activities, including terrorism, not drug trafficking, which is handled by other dedicated agencies.  These incorrect pairings highlight the importance of understanding the specific mandates and functions of different legal frameworks and institutions in India's fight against financial crime.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                  Specific Aspect of Cooperation
    1. Bangladesh                            :   India's smallest trade partner in South Asia
    2. China                                  :   Shares a largely undisputed border with India in the Middle Sector
    3. Singapore                             :   India's largest trade partner in ASEAN in 2023-24
    4. Vietnam                               :   No significant defence cooperation exercises with India


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 2 and 3 only
    (b) 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  While the India-China border has disputed sections, the middle sector is largely undisputed, reflecting periods of relative stability in that region. Singapore was indeed India's largest trading partner within ASEAN in 2023-24, highlighting the strong economic ties between the two countries.

Pair 1 is incorrect: Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, not the smallest. Pair 4 is incorrect: India and Vietnam do have significant defence cooperation exercises.  These incorrect pairings demonstrate the complexities of bilateral relations and the need for nuanced understanding of specific aspects of cooperation between nations.  The distractors highlight the importance of precise factual recall in accurately assessing bilateral relations.


**4. With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                    Key Characteristic/Recent Development
    1. BIMSTEC                               :   Acquired legal personality in 2023
    2. The Quad                               :   Adopted the "Wilmington Declaration" in 2023
    3. The Commonwealth                      :   India is its smallest member by population
    4. The Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)       :   Recently called for the removal of North Korea from a US unilateral list


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c) because pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. BIMSTEC did acquire legal personality after the entry into force of its charter in May 2024, not 2023. The Quad Leaders' Summit did adopt the Wilmington Declaration.  NAM did call for Cuba's removal from the US unilateral terrorism list.

Pair 3 is incorrect; India is the largest member of the Commonwealth by population.  The incorrect pairing in option (d) serves as a crucial distractor, illustrating the importance of precise factual recall regarding the relative size and influence of various member states within international organizations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect information enhances the question's difficulty and necessitates detailed knowledge of these organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country          Major River
1. Bangladesh       Brahmaputra
2. Maldives         Ganga
3. USA              Mississippi
4. UK               Thames
5. India            Indus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Brahmaputra River flows through Bangladesh. The Mississippi River is a major river in the USA. The Thames River flows through the UK.  The Indus River is a major river in India.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes Bangladesh and the Brahmaputra. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the Thames and Indus rivers. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the Indus River. Option (d) is the only option that correctly matches all the countries with their major rivers mentioned in the provided text.  The inclusion of the Indus River is crucial to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of major rivers in the mentioned countries. The other options act as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of geography and ability to identify correct pairings.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect pairings of geographical features.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country              Major Mountain Range
1. USA                 Himalayas
2. UK                  Pennines
3. India               Rocky Mountains
4. Bangladesh         Appalachian Mountains
5. Maldives           Aravalli Range

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Pennines are a major mountain range in the UK.  The other options are incorrect. The Himalayas are in India and Nepal; the Rocky Mountains are in the USA; the Appalachian Mountains are in the eastern USA; and the Aravalli Range is in India. The question tests factual recall of geographical features and countries. The inclusion of plausible, but incorrect, pairings serves as a strong distractor, requiring careful consideration of each pair. The seemingly plausible pairings such as the Himalayas with USA or the Rocky Mountains with India are carefully constructed distractors.  The correct answer highlights the importance of precise knowledge of geographical features.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                  Initiatives/Activities
1. UNODC                         Global Firearms Programme
2. FATF                           Mutual Evaluation Report
3.  INCB                          Combating money laundering
4. GLOBE Network                Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice
5. CCPCJ                         Youth engagement in crime prevention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) undertakes the Global Firearms Programme.  The FATF (Financial Action Task Force) conducts Mutual Evaluation Reports. The CCPCJ (Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice) launched the Generation Justice initiative, which includes youth engagement in crime prevention.  The other options are incorrect because they misattribute initiatives to organizations.  Option (a) omits the CCPCJ's involvement in youth engagement. Option (c) incorrectly links INCB and GLOBE network with the listed activities. Option (d) again omits the CCPCJ.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations, their mandates, and their specific activities. The inclusion of multiple international organizations and their diverse activities serves as a strong distractor, enhancing the difficulty level.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise      Participating Countries
1. Yudh Abhyas          India and Russia
2. Vajra Prahar         India and USA
3. Shakti                India and France
4. Varuna                India and China
5. KAZIND-2024           India and Kazakhstan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Vajra Prahar is a joint military exercise between India and the USA. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and France. KAZIND-2024 is a joint military exercise between India and Kazakhstan.  Yudh Abhyas is between India and the USA, not Russia. Varuna is between India and France, not China. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of bilateral military exercises involving India.  The inclusion of incorrect pairings and the subtle alteration of participating countries in some pairs serve as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge of these exercises.  The correct answer emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge of defense collaborations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative        Focus Area
1. PIWTT                       Energy Cooperation
2. BIMSTEC Charter           Regional Security
3.  SAARC Convention            Combating Trafficking
4.  Common Pledge Initiative   Women, Peace, and Security
5.  Wilmington Declaration      Cancer Research

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BIMSTEC Charter focuses on regional security and cooperation. The SAARC Convention addresses combating trafficking in women and children. The Common Pledge Initiative focuses on women, peace, and security. The Wilmington Declaration includes initiatives related to cancer research.  PIWTT (Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit) primarily focuses on trade and connectivity, not specifically energy cooperation. The question tests the candidate's understanding of various regional and international initiatives and their respective focus areas. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings acts as a strong distractor. The correct option highlights the need for a nuanced understanding of the scope and objectives of these initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                     Key Feature/Participant
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                     :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for combating money laundering
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)           :   Jagjit Pavadia's re-election for a third term
3.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) :   Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
4.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)     :   World Drug Day Report highlighting cannabis abuse

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The FATF indeed uses Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) to assess countries' efforts against money laundering and terrorist financing.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is a documented fact. The CCPCJ's launch of the Generation Justice initiative is also accurately reflected. Finally, the UNODC's release of the World Drug Day Report, focusing on global drug abuse trends including the prominent role of cannabis, is a verifiable event.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region/Area                                  Drug-Related Characteristic
1.  Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay)  :   Highest cannabis abuse rates globally
2.  Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)        :   Renamed as "Death Triangle" due to high opium production
3.  Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)     :   Significant cannabis legalization efforts
4.  Canada                                            :   Legalized cannabis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Triple Frontier Area is known for drug trafficking, but the statement about the highest cannabis abuse rates is an oversimplification and not entirely accurate; other regions report higher rates. The Golden Triangle is correctly associated with high opium production and its renaming. The Golden Crescent is accurately described, but  the statement about cannabis legalization efforts is incorrect—it's not known for widespread legalization.  Canada did legalize cannabis, making (d) the correct option.  Options (a), (b), and (c) contain inaccuracies and incomplete information.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                Focus Area
1.  Biological Weapons Convention (1972)         :   Prohibition of chemical weapons development
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)          :   Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
3.  Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (1998) :   Prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide
4.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (2000) :   Combating transnational organized crime

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention focuses on biological weapons, not chemical weapons, making pair 1 incorrect. Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurate.  The Chemical Weapons Convention explicitly addresses chemical weapons, the Rome Statute establishes the ICC for specific crimes, and the UNTOC convention targets transnational organized crime. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                        Primary Function/Goal
1.  GlobE Network                                 :   Combating money laundering in India
2.  SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) :   Combating wildlife crime in South Asia
3.  SAARC Convention on Trafficking in Women and Children:   Preventing and combating human trafficking in South Asia
4.  India-UN Development Partnership              :   Commonwealth Sub Window for development projects

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

GlobE's focus is broader than just money laundering in India; it's a global anti-corruption network.  However, SAWEN, the SAARC Convention, and the India-UN Development Partnership (with its Commonwealth Sub Window) all accurately reflect their primary functions. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one mismatched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Provision/Impact
1.  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958     :   Applies only to Jammu and Kashmir
2.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002    :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
3.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967   :   Deals primarily with terrorist financing
4.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000              :   India's implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

AFSPA applies to several states in addition to Jammu and Kashmir, making pair 1 incorrect.  The PMLA's establishment of the FIU-IND, the UAPA's focus on unlawful activities including terrorism, and the Chemical Weapons Convention Act's implementation of the international treaty are all accurate. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (c) is correct. Options (a), (b), and (d) include at least one incorrect pairing.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Convention/Act                    Focus Area
1. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000       :   Prohibition of development and use of biological weapons
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Combating terrorist financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
3. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 :   Combating money laundering
4.  1993 Chemical Weapons Convention           :   Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is an Indian law that implements the Chemical Weapons Convention, which bans the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. Option 1 incorrectly links it to biological weapons.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, primarily focuses on preventing money laundering, not directly on terrorist financing or weapons proliferation, although it plays a role in the broader context of national security.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (also known as the Palermo Convention), is a comprehensive treaty aimed at tackling transnational organized crime, including but not limited to money laundering. Option 3 correctly links this convention with its core objective.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention accurately reflects its focus on banning the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Key Initiative/Program
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   Atoms4Food
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)    :   Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization focused on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. Its key initiative is the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), which assesses countries' measures to combat these issues. Option 1 incorrectly links FATF with Atoms4Food, which is an IAEA program. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) works on drug control, crime prevention, and criminal justice.  It does not directly conduct MERs.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) focuses on nuclear energy and safety.  Atoms4Food is an IAEA program aimed at improving food security through nuclear techniques.  Option 3 incorrectly attributes TOCTA to the IAEA. TOCTA is a UNODC initiative.  Therefore, only option 2 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Membership/Activity
1. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)              :   India's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda
2.  Five Eyes Alliance                          :   Australia allowing non-citizen residents to join its armed forces
3.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)                :   India's release of commemorative postage stamps for its 150th anniversary
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)   :   India's request for AIIB to assist low-income countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational naval coalition, and India's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda is a recent example of its activities.  The Five Eyes Alliance involves intelligence sharing between five countries, and Australia's decision regarding non-citizen residents' participation in its armed forces is a matter of national policy.  The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a UN agency, and India's release of commemorative postage stamps is a celebration of its anniversary. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) focuses on infrastructure development, and India's request reflects its engagement with the organization. All pairs 1, 3, and 4 accurately reflect the organizations' activities and India's involvement.  Pair 2 is correctly matched, but the focus is on Australia's internal policy, not the core function of the Five Eyes Alliance.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                 Key Feature
1. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 : Grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas"
2.  India-US Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) :   Focuses on combating transnational organized crime
3.  India-US Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) :   Facilitates access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa
4.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative  :   Enhances cooperation in Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958, grants special powers to the armed forces in areas declared "disturbed," allowing them to operate with certain exemptions from ordinary law.  Pair 1 correctly reflects this key feature. LEMOA facilitates logistics support between the Indian and US militaries, not related to combating transnational crime. COMCASA deals with secure communication systems, not the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on clean energy investment, not on technological cooperation.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The other options present incorrect or misleading associations between the acts/agreements and their actual features.


**5. With reference to India's relations with other countries and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Organization                          Specific Engagement/Issue
1.  Mauritius                                   :   India's first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra
2.  Rwanda                                      :   Implementation of the India-UN Development Fund
3.  The Commonwealth                           :   India's participation in the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)
4.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)             :   Adoption of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's inauguration of its first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra (JAK) in Mauritius represents a specific engagement in healthcare cooperation.  The UK's involvement with Rwanda regarding asylum seekers is a separate matter entirely. India's active participation in the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) is a known fact.  The adoption of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 between India and the GCC signifies a crucial step in bilateral relations.  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Pair 2 incorrectly links Rwanda to the India-UN Development Fund; while India contributes to the fund, its specific engagement with Rwanda is not directly related to this fund.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative          Specific Feature/Event
1. Commonwealth of Nations                 :   Established the Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund
2. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)           :   Adopted the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 at a Joint Ministerial Meeting with India
3. BIMSTEC                                   :   Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force
4. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)   :   Belarus joined as its tenth member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Commonwealth of Nations indeed established the Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund in 2018,  a key initiative for development cooperation.  The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting did result in the adoption of the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028, signifying a strengthened strategic partnership.  The BIMSTEC Charter's coming into force in May 2024 did grant BIMSTEC legal personality, a significant step in its institutional development. Finally, Belarus's accession as the tenth member of the SCO in 2023 expanded the organization's geographical reach and influence.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of recent developments in various international organizations and initiatives, requiring the candidate to accurately link the organization with the specific event or feature.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Agreement           Key Characteristic/Outcome
1. International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) :   Bypasses Pakistan to provide a sea route to Afghanistan
2. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)      :   India elected as Vice-Chair of its Supply Chain Council
3. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):   Aims to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran
4.  India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA): Facilitates UPI payments in Malaysia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The INSTC is correctly paired with its key characteristic of providing an alternative route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Council did elect India as Vice-Chair, demonstrating India's growing influence in regional economic cooperation. The India-Malaysia Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA) does include provisions to facilitate UPI payments in Malaysia, enhancing economic ties.  However, the IMEC's primary aim is not to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran; it aims to connect India, the Middle East, and Europe,  making option 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are partially or entirely incorrect due to the mismatching of the IMEC. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of various economic corridors and agreements, demanding precise knowledge of their objectives and outcomes.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                   Significant Bilateral Exercise with India
1.  USA                                      :   Exercise Shakti
2. France                                   :   Exercise Varuna
3. Kazakhstan                              :   Exercise Yudh Abhyas
4.  Russia                                   :   Exercise Indra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. France and India regularly conduct the bilateral naval exercise Varuna, and India and Russia conduct the bilateral exercise Indra.  Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and France, not the USA. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise between India and the USA, not Kazakhstan.  Therefore, options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one mismatched pair.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's defense cooperation with various countries, requiring specific recall of the names of bilateral exercises.  The inclusion of plausible distractors makes the question challenging.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement/Initiative                     Location/Area of Application
1. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA)  :   Jammu and Kashmir only
2. India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline         :   Connects Katihar to Bornagar
3. Chabahar Port Agreement                     :   Located on the Gulf of Oman
4. Greater Male Connectivity Project             :   Maldives' largest infrastructure project


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. The Chabahar Port is indeed located on the Gulf of Oman, and the Greater Male Connectivity Project is correctly identified as the Maldives' largest infrastructure project.  However, AFSPA's application extends beyond Jammu and Kashmir to other states in Northeast India, making pair 1 incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline does not connect Katihar to Bornagar; that's an upcoming electricity corridor. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one mismatched pair. The question tests the candidate's ability to connect legislative acts, infrastructure projects, and agreements with their relevant geographical locations or areas of operation.  The close but incorrect options make this a difficult question.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country             Capital City
1.  Mauritius         :   Port Louis
2.  Rwanda           :   Kigali
3.  Togo              :   Lomé
4.  Democratic Republic of Congo :   Kinshasa
5.  Uzbekistan        :   Tashkent

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched.  Mauritius' capital is Port Louis, Rwanda's is Kigali, Togo's is Lomé, the Democratic Republic of Congo's is Kinshasa, and Uzbekistan's is Tashkent. These are well-established and readily verifiable facts. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities, a fundamental aspect of geography and general knowledge frequently assessed in UPSC examinations.  Incorrect options serve as plausible distractors, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge to avoid errors.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature     Location
1. Lake Turkana           :   Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro       :   Tanzania
3. Lipulekh Pass          :   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal             :   Egypt
5. Gulf of Aden           :   Between Red Sea and Arabian Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania. Lipulekh Pass is in Uttarakhand, India. The Suez Canal is in Egypt, and the Gulf of Aden lies between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.  This question assesses factual recall of geographical locations.  The inclusion of diverse geographical features—a lake, a mountain, a pass, a canal, and a gulf—tests the candidate's broad geographical knowledge.  Incorrect options act as distractors, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific locations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Country              Bordering Country
1.  Rwanda            :   Uganda
2.  Togo               :   Ghana
3.  Democratic Republic of Congo :   Tanzania
4.  Uzbekistan        :   Kazakhstan
5.  Philippines        :   China

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Rwanda shares a border with Uganda, Togo with Ghana, and Uzbekistan with Kazakhstan.  However, the Democratic Republic of Congo does not border Tanzania directly; they are separated by other countries.  The Philippines shares maritime boundaries with China, but not a direct land border. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international boundaries, a key aspect of geopolitical understanding. Incorrect options test the ability to differentiate between direct land borders and maritime boundaries, a crucial distinction in geopolitical analysis.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Sea/Ocean           Country with Coastline
1.  Celebes Sea       :   Philippines
2.  South China Sea  :   Philippines
3.  Gulf of Guinea    :   Togo
4.  Andaman Sea       :   Thailand
5.  Indian Ocean      :   Somalia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the relationship between the sea/ocean and the country possessing a coastline on it. The Philippines borders both the Celebes Sea and the South China Sea. Togo has a coastline on the Gulf of Guinea. Thailand borders the Andaman Sea.  Somalia has a coastline on the Indian Ocean.  This question assesses knowledge of maritime geography and the coastal boundaries of various countries.  All options except (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct pairing, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of coastal geographies.


**5. With reference to geographical features, consider the following pairs:**

Feature              Description
1.  Pangong Tso        :   World’s highest saltwater lake
2.  Great Barrier Reef :   World’s largest coral reef system
3.  Seine River         :   France's second-longest river
4.  Lake Kivu           :   Forms part of Rwanda's western border
5.  Abu Musa Island     :   Disputed between Iran and UAE

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. Pangong Tso is indeed the world's highest saltwater lake. The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system. The Seine River is France's second longest. Lake Kivu forms part of Rwanda's western border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. Abu Musa Island is a subject of a territorial dispute between Iran and the UAE.  This question tests knowledge of significant geographical features and their attributes.  Incorrect options act as plausible distractors, testing the ability to distinguish between correct and slightly modified or incorrect descriptions.  The breadth of features included – a lake, a reef, a river, another lake and an island - ensures comprehensive testing.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Capital City
1. Uzbekistan                 :   Dushanbe
2. Thailand                   :   Bangkok
3. Lao PDR                    :   Vientiane
4. Philippines                :   Manila
5. United Arab Emirates       :   Abu Dhabi

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, Vientiane is the capital of Lao PDR, Manila is the capital of the Philippines, and Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of the United Arab Emirates with Abu Dhabi. Option (c) is incorrect because it only includes Uzbekistan and the UAE, omitting the correct pairings for Thailand, Lao PDR, and the Philippines. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of Dushanbe as the capital of Uzbekistan; Dushanbe is actually the capital of Tajikistan.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities of Asian countries, a common theme in geography-related UPSC questions. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (like Dushanbe for Uzbekistan) increases the difficulty level and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related geographical entities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature        Location
1. Lake Turkana              :   Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro          :   Tanzania, Africa
3. Lipulekh Pass             :   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal                :   Panama
5. Gulf of Aden              :    Between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Lake Turkana is located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia; Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania, Africa; Lipulekh Pass is situated in Uttarakhand, India; and the Gulf of Aden is located between the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Option (a) is incorrect as it excludes the correct pairing for the Gulf of Aden. Option (c) is also incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrect pairing of the Suez Canal with Panama; the Suez Canal is actually located in Egypt, connecting the Mediterranean and Red Seas. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical locations and features across different continents. The inclusion of the Suez Canal, a well-known waterway, paired incorrectly with Panama, serves as a strong distractor, highlighting the need for precise geographical knowledge.


**3. With reference to countries and their bordering entities, consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Bordering Entity
1. Estonia                    :   Belarus
2. Latvia                     :   Russia
3. Lithuania                  :   Estonia
4. Iran                       :   Persian Gulf
5. Turkiye                    :   Black Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Latvia borders Russia; Lithuania shares a border with Estonia; Iran has a coastline on the Persian Gulf; and Turkiye (Turkey) is bordered by the Black Sea. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of Turkiye with the Black Sea. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairings for Iran and Turkiye. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly includes Estonia, which does not border Belarus.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of international boundaries and geopolitical relationships. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings (like Estonia and Belarus) increases the question's difficulty and assesses the examinee's ability to precisely recall international borders.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

International Organization   Location of Recent Summit
1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank :   Bahrain
2. Arab League                  :   Bahrain
3.  G7 Summit                   : Apulia, Italy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The Arab League Summit 2024 was held in Bahrain, and the G7 Summit was held in Apulia, Italy. Option (a) is incorrect because the AIIB summit location is not mentioned in the provided text. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct information about the G7 summit. Option (d) is incorrect because it wrongly includes the AIIB summit location.  The question tests knowledge of recent international summits and their locations, requiring recall of specific events and locations.  The inclusion of the AIIB, a less frequently discussed organization compared to the G7 or Arab League, adds complexity and assesses the candidate's ability to recall details about less prominent international bodies.



**5. With reference to significant geographical features, consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature      Description
1.  Pangong Tso            :   World’s highest saltwater lake
2. Great Barrier Reef       :   World’s largest coral reef system
3.  Baltic Sea              :   World’s largest inland brackish sea
4.  Seine River             :   France's longest river
5.  Kaladan River           :   Flows through Rakhine State, Myanmar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Pangong Tso is indeed the world's highest saltwater lake; the Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system; the Baltic Sea is the world's largest inland brackish sea; and the Kaladan River does flow through Rakhine State, Myanmar.  Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing for the Kaladan River. Option (c) is also incorrect for the same reason. Option (d) is incorrect because it incorrectly states that the Seine River is France's longest river; it is actually the second longest. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of significant geographical features and their characteristics.  The inclusion of a seemingly straightforward fact (Seine River) with a subtly incorrect description increases the question's difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Aims to mobilize up to $300 billion by 2027
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative        : Led by the G20
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Focuses on sustainable port infrastructure development

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d) None

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are entirely correctly matched. Let's analyze each:

1. **PGII:** The statement is incorrect.  The PGII aims to mobilize *up to $600 billion*, not $300 billion, by 2027. This is a significant factual error, making the pair incorrect.

2. **Energy for Growth in Africa:** This statement is incorrect. The initiative is led by the G7, not the G20.  Confusing these two major international groups is a common distractor in UPSC-style questions.

3. **G7 FSOI:** This pair is also incorrect. While the G7 FSOI does deal with ocean sustainability, the description of focusing on *sustainable port infrastructure development* is more accurately associated with the "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership," a separate initiative mentioned in the target content.  This highlights the need for precise recall of specific initiatives and their features.


The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives and their core objectives. The inclusion of partially correct but ultimately inaccurate pairs makes the question challenging and requires careful attention to detail.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Specific Initiative
1.  The Commonwealth                         :  India-UN Development Fund
2.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       :  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal
3.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

Let's examine each pair:

1. **The Commonwealth and India-UN Development Fund:** This pair is correctly matched. The target content clearly states that a Commonwealth Sub Window was established under the India-UN Development Fund.  This demonstrates knowledge of the Commonwealth's activities and India's role within it.

2. **FATF and MLAT Portal:** This is also correctly matched. The text explicitly mentions the launch of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal as an Indian initiative to combat money laundering, falling under the purview of FATF's objectives. This showcases understanding of India's anti-money laundering measures and international cooperation.

3. **UNODC and SAWEN:** This pair is incorrect. While UNODC is involved in combating transnational crime, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) is a *regional*, not a UNODC, initiative. The question tests the ability to distinguish between global and regional organizations and their respective roles in tackling specific issues.


The question tests factual recall and understanding of the relationship between international organizations and their specific initiatives. The inclusion of a partially correct pair (SAWEN) serves as a distractor, requiring careful consideration of each organization's functions.


**3. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following pairs:**

   G7 Initiative                                   Characteristic
1. PGII                                          :  Focuses primarily on African nations
2.  G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition                   :  Aimed at reducing global oil prices
3.  Apulia Food Systems Initiative               :  Enhances food security and sustainable agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

1. **PGII and Focus on African Nations:**  This pair is incorrect. While the PGII does fund infrastructure projects in developing nations, it's not *primarily* focused on African nations. The initiative has a broader scope encompassing various developing countries globally.  This highlights the need for precise understanding of the geographical reach of global initiatives.

2. **G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition and Reducing Global Oil Prices:** This pair is correctly matched. The explicit mention of the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition in the target content directly indicates its aim to control and potentially lower global oil prices. This demonstrates comprehension of the coalition's objective.

3. **Apulia Food Systems Initiative and Food Security:** This pair is correctly matched. The text explicitly states that the Apulia Food Systems initiative aims to enhance food security and promote sustainable agriculture. This demonstrates knowledge of the G7's focus on broader global challenges beyond energy.


The question tests the candidate's ability to accurately associate G7 initiatives with their specific goals and geographical scope. The inclusion of a partially correct pair (PGII) adds complexity and prevents simple elimination of options.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of international cooperation in addressing global challenges.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention             Key Feature
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)         :  India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000
2.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :  Supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003
3.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution :  Established in 2011


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

1. **CWC and Indian Legislation:** This pair is correctly matched. The text clearly states that India is a signatory to the CWC and enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrating India's commitment to international agreements related to chemical weapons.

2. **UNTOC and UN Convention Against Corruption:** This is also correctly matched. The provided text explicitly states that the UNTOC is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, showcasing understanding of the interconnectedness of international legal frameworks in addressing transnational crime.

3. **SAARC Convention on Trafficking and Establishment Year:** This pair is incorrect. The SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution was indeed established, but the year mentioned (2011) is incorrect. The provided text doesn't state the exact year of establishment for SAWEN.  This highlights the need for precise recall of dates and the importance of avoiding generalizations in UPSC-style questions.


The question tests factual recall and understanding of international legal frameworks and their implementation at the national level.  The inclusion of a partially correct pair (SAARC Convention) serves as a distractor, requiring careful analysis of the information provided.  The question assesses knowledge of international conventions and their associated details.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following pairs:**

    Council/Network                                     Focus Area
    1. Supply Chain Council                           :   Crisis response to supply chain disruptions
    2. Crisis Response Network                        :   Strengthening critical supply chains
    3. Labor Rights Advisory Board                   :   Enhancing labor rights and workforce development

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) established three bodies under its Supply Chain Agreement.  The Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, not responding to crises.  The Crisis Response Network, as its name suggests, provides a platform for collective emergency responses to disruptions in supply chains. The Labor Rights Advisory Board specifically addresses labor rights and workforce development within regional supply chains. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the Supply Chain Council's primary focus is not crisis response. Option (b) is incorrect as the Crisis Response Network deals with emergencies, not general supply chain strengthening. Option (d) is incorrect because, while pair 3 is correct, pair 1 is not.  Understanding the distinct roles of each IPEF body is crucial for comprehending its multifaceted approach to economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region.


**2. With reference to India's economic corridors, consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Corridor                                 Key Feature
    1. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Connects India to the Middle East and Europe via sea routes
    2. China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC)        :   Includes development of Gwadar Port in Pakistan
    3. India-Middle East-Economic-Corridor (IMEEEC)  :   Involves the development of a major deep draft port in India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, primarily through improved maritime routes.  The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) significantly involves the development and utilization of Gwadar Port in Pakistan as a key component of its infrastructure projects. The India-Middle East-Economic-Corridor (IMEEEC), as described in the provided text, includes the development of a major deep draft port in India to facilitate trade and connectivity. Understanding these economic corridors is important for analyzing India's evolving geopolitical and economic strategies.  The correct answer encompasses all three, highlighting a comprehensive understanding of India's engagement in regional and global economic initiatives.


**3. With reference to regional organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                       Membership Characteristic
    1. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)        :   Belarus recently joined as its 10th member
    2. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) :   Includes Australia, China, and Japan as members
    3. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)                 :   Includes Iran and Jordan as members

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Belarus's recent accession to the SCO is accurate. However, pair 2 is incorrect because while ASEAN has 10 members, Australia, China, and Japan are not among them; they are part of broader regional cooperation frameworks involving ASEAN but are not members of ASEAN itself. Pair 3 is incorrect; Iran and Jordan are not members of the GCC.  The question tests knowledge of the membership of key regional organizations and highlights the nuances of regional cooperation in different parts of the world.  Distinguishing between formal membership and broader engagement is essential for a complete understanding of international relations.


**4. With reference to international agreements and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Initiative                                 Key Feature
    1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)   :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
    2. Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) within SAARC    :   Decisions are taken unanimously within SAARC
    3. Indus Water Treaty                               :   India controls the eastern rivers Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The feature mentioned concerning unanimous decision-making within SAARC is accurate.  Pair 1 is incorrect because India has a trade *deficit*, not surplus, with ASEAN under AITIGA. Pair 3 is incorrect because while the Indus Water Treaty does give India control over certain rivers, the statement incorrectly lists all three rivers as being under India's control.  The question tests understanding of key economic and water-sharing agreements and the decision-making processes within regional organizations.  It emphasizes the importance of understanding the precise details of these agreements for a thorough analysis of international cooperation and potential points of conflict or cooperation.


**5. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                       Key Program/Initiative
    1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)       :   Atoms4NetZero initiative
    2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)     :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
    3. International Solar Alliance (ISA)              :    Membership includes Panama and Italy

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 1 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions, and the ITU releases the Global Cybersecurity Index.  However, pair 3 is incorrect. While Singapore joined the ISA, the statement incorrectly includes Panama and Italy as members.  The question assesses knowledge of the mandates and key initiatives of international organizations working in diverse sectors like energy, telecommunications, and sustainable development.  It emphasizes the need to have precise information about the memberships and activities of these organizations for informed analysis.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative                      Focus Area
1.  Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI) :  Combating piracy in the Indian Ocean
2.  Quad Cancer Moonshot                     :  Developing new cancer treatments for South Asia
3.  Quad Ports of the Future Partnership       :  Improving port infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region
4.  BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :  Facilitating cross-border trade within BRICS nations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI) aims to enhance maritime domain awareness and cooperation, not specifically combating piracy.  While combating piracy is a related objective, it's not the primary or sole focus. The Quad Cancer Moonshot focuses on cancer research and treatment, but its scope isn't limited to South Asia. The Quad Ports of the Future Partnership indeed aims to improve port infrastructure in the Indo-Pacific region by promoting sustainable development.  The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay is designed to facilitate faster and more efficient cross-border payments among BRICS nations, reducing reliance on existing international payment systems. Option (b) correctly identifies the accurate pairings of 3 and 4.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise understanding of the initiatives' objectives and scope.  A correct understanding necessitates differentiating between the primary focus and related objectives of these initiatives, reflecting a higher level of analytical skill.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization                      Key Initiative/Feature
1.  AUKUS                                  :   Formal military alliance similar to NATO
2.  BIMSTEC                               :   Launched the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity
3.  SAARC                                  :   Highly functional since 2016
4.  SCO                                    :   Belarus joined as the 9th member in 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

AUKUS is not a formal military alliance; it's a security partnership focused on defense technology sharing. BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) did indeed launch the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity. SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) has been largely dysfunctional since 2016, not highly functional.  Belarus joined the SCO (Shanghai Cooperation Organisation) as its 10th member, not 9th. Option (c) is correct because only the pairing of BIMSTEC and its transport connectivity initiative is accurate. The other options contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of these regional organizations and their activities to arrive at the correct answer.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information regarding these significant international organizations.


**3. With reference to India's foreign policy initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Partner Country/Region
1.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Russia
2.  Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)            :   Vietnam
3.  Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) :  Malaysia
4.  Chabahar Port Development                 :    Afghanistan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to improve connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, but Russia is not the primary partner involved.  The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) does indeed include Vietnam among its partner countries.  A Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) exists between India and Malaysia.  India's development of the Chabahar Port involves cooperation with Afghanistan. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. This question assesses the understanding of India's multifaceted foreign policy engagements and requires precise knowledge of partner countries involved in specific initiatives.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between actual partners and those that might seem plausible due to geographical proximity or other factors.


**4. With reference to international organizations and their activities, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Activity/Characteristic
1.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)         :   France is not a founding member
2.  International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) :  A United Nations agency
3.  NATO                                      :   Ukraine is a member
4.  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)              :   India joined in 1996

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

France is a founding member of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) along with India. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) is an intergovernmental organization, not a UN agency. Ukraine is not currently a member of NATO.  India did join the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996.  Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their key features, requiring them to identify the factual inaccuracies in the other pairings. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring detailed knowledge to differentiate between correct and incorrect information. This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify misinformation related to important international organizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                        Key Feature
1.  Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement (ENNPIA) :  AUKUS initiative
2.  India-GCC Political Dialogue             :   First held in 2002
3.  Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) (India-Singapore) :  India is a net exporter
4.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council:   India is the Chair

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The ENNPIA is indeed a key part of the AUKUS initiative. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2003, not 2002. Under the India-Singapore CECA, India is a net importer, not exporter. India was elected Vice-Chair, not Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council. Only the first pair is correctly matched. This question tests detailed knowledge of specific agreements and initiatives, requiring accurate recall of facts and figures. The distractors are carefully chosen to include plausible but incorrect information, enhancing the difficulty level and testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar but not identical information. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to identify subtle differences in details.


**1. With reference to international collaborations in space, consider the following pairs:**

   Country Collaboration  Project Name
1. Japan                  :    Space MAITRI Mission
2. France                 :    TRISHNA Mission
3. Australia              :    Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that India is collaborating with France on the TRISHNA Mission.  Option (b) is therefore correct.  Option (a) is incorrect because while India and Japan have discussed space collaborations, the text does not specifically link Japan to the Space MAITRI Mission.  The text mentions a Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation as a collaborative effort, but does not specify a partnering country, making option (c) incorrect,  Option (d) combines an incorrect pairing (Japan/Space MAITRI) with an unconfirmed pairing (Australia/Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation), making it also incorrect.  The question tests factual recall of specific international space collaborations mentioned in the provided text, focusing on precise details rather than general knowledge of space programs.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country Initiative/Project                                    Description

**Explanation:**

The text confirms that the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994 with India joining in 1996, that an ASEAN-India Maritime Exercise exists, and that the AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.  All three pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's engagement with ASEAN, requiring recall of specific initiatives and their features. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the dynamics of India-ASEAN relations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                      Key Feature/Provision
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000:   Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), 1993:        Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
3. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention:                Focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking
4. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC), 1998:    Established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a crucial international treaty aimed at combating transnational organized crime.  It does *not*, however, prohibit biological weapons; that's the purview of the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention.  Option 1 is thus incorrect.

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993 accurately bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  This makes option 2 correct.

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, not the monitoring of illicit nuclear trafficking. That function is carried out by the IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB). Option 3 is therefore incorrect.

The Rome Statute of 1998 correctly established the International Criminal Court (ICC). Option 4 is correct.

Therefore, only options 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                      Drug-Related Characteristic
1. Canada:                                              Highest prevalence of sickle cell disease in South Asia
2. Uruguay:                                             Most abused drug is Cannabis
3. Afghanistan:                                         Part of the "Golden Crescent" (now "Death Crescent") region
4. India:                                                Legalized Cannabis


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Canada and Uruguay are among the countries that have legalized cannabis, making option 1 incorrect.  India has not legalized cannabis. Option 4 is also incorrect.

The statement about the highest prevalence of sickle cell disease is incorrect; India holds this distinction.  Option 1 is incorrect.

The World Drug Day report correctly identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, and Afghanistan is indeed part of the Golden Crescent region (now often referred to as the Death Crescent), a major opium-producing area.  Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correct.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                 Primary Focus/Activity
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF):                  Combating money laundering and terrorist financing
2.  South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN):    Facilitating cross-border electricity trade
3.  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE):     Improving global food security
4.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):        Assessing measures to combat proliferation of weapons of mass destruction


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing through international cooperation and setting standards.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

SAWEN is concerned with wildlife crime, not electricity trade.  Pair 2 is incorrect.  GlobE focuses on anti-corruption efforts, not food security. Pair 3 is incorrect.

The INCB plays a role in monitoring international drug control treaties, not assessing weapons proliferation (that's more closely related to the work of other organizations).  Pair 4 is incorrect.  However, the FATF's work does touch upon the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, albeit indirectly, through its focus on preventing financing of such activities. Therefore, only pair 1 is definitively and directly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Body                      Recent Activity/Report
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):         Released Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU):         Reported 168 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023
3. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF):                   Adopted the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India
4. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):       Seized drugs in the Arabian Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA focuses on nuclear issues, not cybersecurity. The ITU is responsible for the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.

The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reports on nuclear material theft, making pair 2 correct.

The CMF is involved in maritime security operations, not in adopting MERs which is the work of the FATF. Pair 3 is incorrect.

The AIIB focuses on infrastructure financing, not drug seizures. Pair 4 is incorrect. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                     Geographic/Political Feature
1. Bangladesh:                                        Shares a border with five Indian states
2. Bhutan:                                           Part of the Eastern Himalayas
3. Nepal:                                             Decided not to endorse the BBIN initiative
4. China:                                             Largest trading partner of India in goods (2023)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh does indeed share borders with five Indian states (West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram). Bhutan is situated in the Eastern Himalayas. Nepal's decision to not endorse the BBIN initiative is also accurate.  However, while China is a significant trading partner of India, it is not necessarily *the* largest trading partner every year; this is a fluctuating relationship depending on various economic factors. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are definitively and consistently correct.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                     Focus Area
1. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention              :   Prohibition of chemical weapon development and use
2. 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention               :   Elimination of chemical weapons stockpiles
3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court :   Prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological and toxin weapons.  Option 1 incorrectly attributes a focus on chemical weapons to this convention. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention aims to eliminate chemical weapons globally, encompassing their production, stockpiling, and use.  Option 2 correctly reflects this. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, making option 3 correct. Therefore, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the mismatched pair 1. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 2. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 1.

3. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   International postal services

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating postal policies and services worldwide.  The Global Cybersecurity Index is related to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not the UPU. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) develops and promotes policies to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing, making pair 2 correct. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) works to combat drug trafficking, crime, and corruption, not international postal services; thus, pair 3 is incorrect.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it includes a mismatched pair. Option (b) is partially correct but omits a correctly matched pair. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes two mismatched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                                 Key Activity/Report

2. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)          :   Global Cybersecurity Index
3. Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) :   World Military Expenditure Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) focuses on infrastructure financing in Asia. The Annual Report on World Drug Day is published by the UNODC. Therefore, pair 1 is mismatched. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) works on nuclear energy and safety, not the Global Cybersecurity Index (which is published by the ITU). Pair 2 is also mismatched. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) publishes the World Military Expenditure Report, making pair 3 correct. Only option (b) correctly identifies the single correctly matched pair. Options (a), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                   Significant Drug-Related Issue/Designation
1. Canada                                          :   Golden Crescent (Death Crescent) region
2. Afghanistan                                      :   Cannabis legalization
3. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :   High rate of drug abuse

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy focuses on countering terrorism, not transnational organized crime. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect.  The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) deals with crime prevention and criminal justice, not primarily countering terrorism. Pair 2 is also incorrect. The GlobE Network supports anti-corruption law enforcement globally, making pair 3 correct. Only option (b) correctly identifies the single correctly matched pair.  Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs.

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program is a prominent initiative focused on utilizing nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions targets. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index is a crucial tool for assessing national cybersecurity capabilities and commitments. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report is a core component of its work in evaluating countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.  Finally, the UNODC regularly publishes the World Wildlife Crime Report, providing crucial data and analysis on the illegal wildlife trade.  Each organization's listed initiative is directly related to its mandate and publicly known.  There are no inaccuracies or mismatches in the provided pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.

3. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)   :  Bans the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons
4. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :  Supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is correct: The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war. Pair 2 is incorrect: The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997.  Pair 3 is correct: The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. Pair 4 is correct: The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, was indeed supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2003. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 2 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative           Key Characteristic/Recent Development
1.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)         : India joined in 2023, conducting Operation Crimson Barracuda
2.  SAARC                                    :  Largely dysfunctional since 2016
3.  BIMSTEC                                 : Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) : Belarus became the 10th member in 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect: India joined the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) in 2022, not 2023.  Pair 2 is correct: The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been largely inactive since 2016 due to geopolitical tensions. Pair 3 is correct: BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) gained legal personality after all member states ratified its charter, which came into effect in 2024. Pair 4 is correct:  Belarus joined the SCO in 2024, becoming its tenth member.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrect pair 1 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**4. With reference to International Organizations and their activities, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Recent Activity/Development
1. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) : Jagjit Pavadia re-elected for a third term
2. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) : Launched Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
3. Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network : India elected to its steering committee
4. OPEC+                                      : Extended deep oil output cuts into 2025


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The INCB did re-elect Jagjit Pavadia. The CCPCJ did launch the GenJust initiative. India was elected to the GLOBE Network's steering committee. And OPEC+ did extend its oil production cuts.  Each statement reflects a verifiable recent event related to the named organization. There are no inaccuracies or mismatches. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature                     Location
1. Lake Turkana                               : Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                            :  South Africa
3. Lipulekh Pass                               : Tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan
4. Suez Canal                                  : Panama Canal Zone


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  This is a well-established geographical fact. Option (a) is therefore correct.

Option (b) is incorrect because Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not South Africa.  Mount Kilimanjaro's location in Tanzania is a fundamental geographical fact.

Option (c) is incorrect because the Suez Canal is located in Egypt, not the Panama Canal Zone.  Confusing the Suez and Panama Canals is a common error, highlighting the need for precise geographical knowledge.

Option (d) is incorrect for the reasons stated above, and also because Lipulekh Pass is situated at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  The precise location of border passes is crucial geopolitical information.  The inclusion of incorrect locations serves as strong distractors, testing the candidate's ability to identify inaccuracies.


**2. With reference to International Relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Country Pair                      Type of Agreement
1. India-Australia                     :   Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022
2. India-Japan                         :   Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA)
3. India-ASEAN                         :    ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) signed in 2009
4. India-UAE                           :  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India and Australia did sign a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2022.  This is a recent and significant development in bilateral economic relations.  India and ASEAN countries also concluded the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) in 2009. This demonstrates India's engagement in regional trade agreements.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


Option (b) is incorrect because while India and Japan have strong defense cooperation, including joint military exercises, the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) is not a bilateral agreement between them.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific agreements.


Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies mentioned above. The inclusion of partially correct information increases the difficulty level.


Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Island/Island Group                     Dispute Involving
1. Abu Musa Island                         :   Iran and the UAE
2. Senkaku Islands                         :   Japan and China
3. Chagos Islands                          :    UK and Mauritius
4. Snake Island                           :  Russia and Ukraine


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Abu Musa Island is indeed a point of contention between Iran and the UAE.  The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are a source of tension between Japan and China.  The Chagos Islands are the subject of a sovereignty dispute between the UK and Mauritius.  Snake Island has been a site of conflict between Russia and Ukraine during the ongoing war.  All four pairs represent actual geopolitical disputes. Thus, option (d) is correct.


The options are designed to test the examinee's knowledge of specific territorial disputes.  Incorrect answers could arise from confusing the parties involved or the locations of the islands.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a challenging question, requiring comprehensive knowledge.


**4. With reference to International Organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                           Key Initiative/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Atoms4NetZero
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) : Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
4. Arab League                             :  SAARC Currency Swap Framework


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program focuses on using nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions.  The ITU releases the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) to assess cybersecurity commitments.  The AIIB launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).  All three pairs correctly link organizations to their key initiatives.  Therefore, "All three" is the correct answer.


Option (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.  The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of the activities and programs of various international organizations.  The distractor is the inclusion of SAARC Currency Swap Framework, which is not associated with the Arab League.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                  Capital City
1.  Somalia                                  :  Nairobi
2.  Rwanda                                   : Kigali
3.  Mauritius                                :  Port Louis
4.  Togo                                     :  Lome


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The capital city of Rwanda is Kigali, Mauritius is Port Louis, and Togo is Lome.  These are all well-known facts. However, the capital of Somalia is Mogadishu, not Nairobi (Nairobi is the capital of Kenya). This is a common error that serves as a key distractor.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of capital cities in Africa.  The incorrect pairing of Somalia with Nairobi increases the difficulty by requiring careful attention to detail.  The options are carefully constructed to test the candidate's ability to identify the correct matches amidst plausible distractors.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the provided text (geographical locations, organizations, and events), creating questions solely focused on economic concepts is not feasible.  The questions below incorporate geographical, organizational, and event-related information, which often have economic implications.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature                 Country
    1. Lake Turkana                       : Kenya
    2. Mount Kilimanjaro                  : Ethiopia
    3. Lipulekh Pass                      : Nepal
    4. Suez Canal                         : Egypt


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is indeed located in Kenya (and partially in Ethiopia). The Suez Canal is correctly paired with Egypt.  However, Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Ethiopia, and while Lipulekh Pass is near the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal, it's primarily situated in Uttarakhand, India.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to identify correct pairings amidst plausible distractors. Option (a) correctly identifies the two accurately matched pairs. The other options include incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect information.  The inclusion of geographically proximate countries as distractors adds to the question's difficulty.


**2. With reference to international organizations and their initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                         Initiative
    1. IAEA                               : Atoms4NetZero
    2. ITU                                 : Global Cybersecurity Index
    3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) : Operation Crimson Barracuda


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes nuclear energy for net-zero emissions. The ITU indeed released the Global Cybersecurity Index.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was a drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy as part of the Combined Maritime Forces.  All three pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses factual recall concerning international organizations and their specific programs. The inclusion of all correct pairs as the answer makes it a straightforward question for those with sufficient knowledge, but it also serves as a good check for complete understanding, differentiating those with full recall from those with partial knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                    Significant Feature
    1. Australia                             : Murray River (Longest River)
    2. United Kingdom                         : Appalachian Mountains
    3. United States                          : Great Lakes
    4. Ireland                                : Pennines


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Australia correctly has the Murray River as its longest river. The United States is correctly associated with the Great Lakes.  However, the United Kingdom does not contain the Appalachian Mountains (which are in North America), and the Pennines are in England, not Ireland.  This question tests geographical knowledge and the ability to correctly match countries with their prominent geographical features. The correct answer option (a) highlights the need for precise knowledge.  Plausible distractors, such as associating the UK with a mountain range or Ireland with a mountain range found in another country, increase the difficulty level.  The question assesses the candidate’s ability to filter out incorrect information and select only the accurate pairings.


**4. With reference to international agreements and conventions, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Convention                     Key Feature
    1. Chemical Weapons Convention           :  Prohibits development and use of biological weapons
    2. Biological Weapons Convention         : Bans the use, production, stockpiling of chemical weapons
    3.  International Criminal Court (ICC)   :  Prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched.  The Chemical Weapons Convention bans chemical weapons, not biological weapons, and vice-versa for the Biological Weapons Convention. The International Criminal Court (ICC) does indeed prosecute war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  This question tests knowledge of international legal frameworks and the ability to differentiate between similar but distinct agreements. The correct answer (b) isolates the single correct pairing.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific mandates of each convention and the need for precise knowledge.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Key Activity/Focus
    1. FATF                                        : Combating money laundering, terrorist financing
    2. UNODC                                       : Annual report on World Drug Day
    3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Assisting low-income countries with financial resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) does release an annual report related to World Drug Day. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) assists low-income countries with access to financial resources. All three pairs are correctly matched. This question assesses knowledge of international organizations and their key functions. The correct answer (b) highlights the importance of understanding the roles of these organizations in global affairs. The inclusion of all three correct pairs underscores the need for comprehensive knowledge of these organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                    Capital City
1. Mauritius                  Port Moresby
2. Rwanda                     Kigali
3. Togo                       Lomé
4. Democratic Republic of Congo Kinshasa
5. Somalia                    Mogadishu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are:

* **Rwanda:** Kigali (This is explicitly stated in the provided text).
* **Togo:** Lomé (This is explicitly stated in the provided text).
* **Democratic Republic of Congo:** Kinshasa (This is explicitly stated in the provided text).
* **Somalia:** Mogadishu (This is explicitly stated in the provided text).

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somalia. Option (b) is partially correct but misses Somalia. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pairing: Mauritius's capital is Port Louis, not Port Moresby (Port Moresby is the capital of Papua New Guinea). Option (d) is the only option that accurately reflects the capital cities of Rwanda, Togo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Somalia.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify correct capital city pairings, a fundamental geographical skill essential for UPSC aspirants.  The inclusion of a plausible distractor (Port Moresby) and the careful arrangement of options necessitate careful consideration rather than simple elimination.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Feature        Location
1. Lake Turkana                 Tanzania
2. Mount Kilimanjaro            Kenya
3. Lipulekh Pass               Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal                   Panama

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only Lipulekh Pass is correctly matched with its location.

* **Lake Turkana:** This lake is situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, not Tanzania (Option 1 is incorrect).
* **Mount Kilimanjaro:**  This mountain is located in Tanzania, not Kenya (Option 2 is incorrect).
* **Lipulekh Pass:** This pass is correctly located close to the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, within Uttarakhand, India (Option 3 is correct).
* **Suez Canal:** This canal is located in Egypt, not Panama (the Panama Canal is a different waterway); (Option 4 is incorrect).

The question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical locations. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (e.g., placing Lake Turkana in Tanzania, a nearby African country) makes the question challenging and assesses the candidate's ability to accurately recall geographical information.  The distractors are designed to test the depth of geographical knowledge, a crucial component in the UPSC examination. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of geographical locations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Island Group             Ocean/Sea
1. Chagos Islands                  Atlantic Ocean
2. Abu Musa Island                 Red Sea
3. Senkaku Islands                 East China Sea
4. Saint Martin's Island           Pacific Ocean
5. Guam Island                     Arctic Ocean


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 3 and 5 only
(d) 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3 only

**Explanation:**

Only the location of Senkaku Islands is correctly matched.

* **Chagos Islands:** These islands are located in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean (Option 1 is incorrect).
* **Abu Musa Island:** This island is located in the Persian Gulf, not the Red Sea (Option 2 is incorrect).
* **Senkaku Islands:**  These islands are correctly located in the East China Sea (Option 3 is correct).
* **Saint Martin's Island:** This island is located in the Bay of Bengal, not the Pacific Ocean (Option 4 is incorrect).
* **Guam Island:** This island is located in the North Pacific Ocean, not the Arctic Ocean (Option 5 is incorrect).

This question tests knowledge of geographical locations of islands and island groups. It includes several plausible distractors, requiring candidates to have precise knowledge to answer correctly.  The options are designed to test the candidate's understanding of global geography and their ability to differentiate between various oceans and seas. The question primarily assesses factual recall and geographical knowledge.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Neighboring Country
1. Thailand                     Vietnam
2. Lao PDR                      Myanmar
3. Philippines                  Indonesia
4. Uzbekistan                    Kazakhstan
5. Australia                    New Zealand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The following pairs are correctly matched:

* **Lao PDR:** Shares a border with Myanmar (This is explicitly stated in the text).
* **Philippines:** Shares maritime borders and proximity with Indonesia. Although not explicitly stated as a direct land border, their close geographical proximity and shared maritime boundaries makes this a valid pairing.
* **Uzbekistan:** Shares a border with Kazakhstan (This is explicitly stated in the text).

Thailand does not directly border Vietnam. The provided text mentions Thailand's borders, but Vietnam is not listed among them.  Australia and New Zealand are not direct land neighbors; they are separated by a significant body of water.  This question assesses the candidate's ability to discern correct neighboring countries from a list of plausible distractors.  This tests factual recall and understanding of geopolitical relationships.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Agreement/Initiative  Participating Countries
1. Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA): India and China
2. Asia-Africa Growth Corridor (AAGC): India and Japan
3.  India-Japan Clean Energy Partnership (CEP): India and South Korea
4.  Mutual Logistics Support Arrangement (MLSA): India and Australia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) Only 4
(d) Only 2 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Only the Asia-Africa Growth Corridor and the Mutual Logistics Support Arrangement are correctly matched with their participating countries.

* **CEPA:** This agreement is between India and Japan, not India and China (Option 1 is incorrect).
* **AAGC:**  This corridor involves India and Japan (Option 2 is correct).
* **India-Japan CEP:** This partnership is between India and Japan (Option 3 is incorrect).
* **MLSA:** This arrangement is correctly between India and Australia (Option 4 is correct).

This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international economic agreements and partnerships.  The incorrect options involve plausible but inaccurate pairings, making it a challenging question that demands precise knowledge.  It tests factual recall and understanding of international economic relations. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of bilateral economic agreements and initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                 Key Initiative/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Atoms4NetZero (promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions)
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) : Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3. Universal Postal Union (UPU)             :  Commemorative postage stamps for its 150th anniversary
4. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       : Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on India's anti-money laundering measures

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program explicitly aims to leverage nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions targets. The ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index 2024 is a well-documented event. The UPU's issuance of commemorative stamps for its 150th anniversary is also a confirmed fact.  Finally, the FATF's adoption of India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assessing its anti-money laundering and terrorist financing measures is a publicly available piece of information.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention            Key Provision/Focus
1. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)     : Bans the development and use of chemical weapons
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)     : Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons
3. Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (1998) :  Focuses on prosecuting individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) indeed establishes the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  The first two pairs are reversed. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons, not chemical weapons, and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, not biological weapons. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, failing to accurately reflect the specific mandates of each international treaty.


**3.  Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                    Key Feature/Activity
1. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)          : Operation Crimson Barracuda (drug seizure in Arabian Sea)
2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources
3.  Group of Seven (G7)                     :  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect the activities and features of the named entities. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) involvement in Operation Crimson Barracuda, a drug seizure operation in the Arabian Sea by the Indian Navy is a documented event. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) actively supports low-income countries' access to financial resources for infrastructure development.  The Group of Seven (G7) launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries.  Therefore, all pairings are factually accurate, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Event                        Key Aspect/Outcome
1.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : World Drug Day Report (highlights on most abused drugs)
2.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ): Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
3.  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): World Military Expenditure 2023 Report (India's ranking)
4.  United Nations Peacekeeping Operations (UNPK) : Nobel Peace Prize (awarded in 1988)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links an organization or event to a key aspect or outcome. The UNODC publishes the annual World Drug Day report detailing global drug trends. The CCPCJ launched the Generation Justice initiative for youth engagement in crime prevention. SIPRI's reports on global military expenditure are well-known, including India's ranking.  Finally, UNPK's receipt of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988 is a historical fact.  All pairings are accurate, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                            Significant Development/Event
1.  Bangladesh                              : Joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative
2.  Bolivia                                  : Became a full member of MERCOSUR
3.  Belarus                                 : Became the 10th member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
4.  Cuba                                    :  NAM calls for its removal from the US unilateral terrorism list


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect recent significant developments related to the named countries/regions. Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, Bolivia's full membership in MERCOSUR, Belarus's accession to the SCO, and the Non-Aligned Movement's call for Cuba's removal from the US terrorism list are all verifiable facts.  Therefore, option (d), which includes all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and, consequently, incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Key Initiative/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Atoms4NetZero (promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions)
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) : Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)         : Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assessing money laundering and terrorist financing measures
4. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Annual Report on World Drug Day

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program explicitly aims to leverage nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions goals. The ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 is a well-documented initiative. The FATF's core function is assessing countries' compliance with anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) standards through Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs).  Finally, the UNODC routinely publishes an annual report in conjunction with World Drug Day, analyzing global drug trends and challenges.  Therefore, option (c) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall of international organizations and their key programs.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention              Key Feature/Objective
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)       : Prohibits the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
2. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention     :  Bans the development and use of biological weapons.
3. Geneva Protocol 1925                    : Prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in conflict.
4. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :  Focuses primarily on combating drug trafficking.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, and the Geneva Protocol of 1925 are all correctly paired with their respective key features and objectives. The CWC comprehensively bans chemical weapons, the 1972 convention addresses biological weapons, and the Geneva Protocol restricts the use of both chemical and biological weapons in armed conflicts.  However, the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), while addressing various aspects of organized crime, does not primarily focus solely on drug trafficking. It has a broader scope, encompassing various transnational crimes.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair 4. This question assesses factual knowledge of international treaties and conventions related to weapons and organized crime.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Recent Significant Action/Event
1. New Zealand                             : Scrapped the "burp tax" on livestock emissions
2. Denmark                                  : Implemented a carbon tax on agriculture
3. India                                     : Contributed to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund
4. Russia                                    : Vetoed a UN Security Council resolution on weapon-free outer space

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect recent significant actions or events associated with the respective countries. New Zealand's decision to scrap its proposed "burp tax" is well-documented. Denmark's introduction of a carbon tax on agriculture is also a confirmed policy change. India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund is a verifiable event.  Russia's veto of the UN Security Council resolution on weapon-free outer space is a matter of public record. Therefore, option (d) is correct, as all four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.  This question tests factual recall of recent international events related to environmental policy, international relations, and counter-terrorism.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Key Report/Publication
1. UNESCAP                                    : Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2024
2. UNCTAD                                     : World Investment Report
3. Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) : World Military Expenditure, 2023 Report
4. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Annual Report on Global Drug Production


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Three of the pairs are correctly matched.  UNESCAP regularly publishes the "Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific," UNCTAD is known for its World Investment Report, and SIPRI publishes the annual World Military Expenditure report. However, the INCB’s reports do not typically focus on the overall global production of drugs; rather they focus on control and monitoring of the international drug trade.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct option. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair (4). This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key publications, requiring recall of specific reports and their issuing bodies.  It assesses factual recall and analytical skills in differentiating between similar organizations and their publications.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Act/Law                                    Key Provision/Feature
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :  Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 : Primarily deals with terrorism financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000          :  Mandates the destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles within a specific timeframe.
4. India Post Office Act of 1854                  : Created the office of the Director General of Post


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

While PMLA is a crucial anti-money laundering law, the FIU-IND's establishment predates it. The UAPA is indeed related to terrorism financing. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 reflects India's commitment to the CWC's mandates, including stockpile destruction. The India Post Office Act of 1854 did centralize postal services. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched, making (c) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of the PMLA and FIU-IND. This question tests knowledge of Indian legislation and its key features, demanding precise understanding of the laws and their implementation.  It assesses factual recall and analytical skills in distinguishing between closely related legal frameworks.


**1. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                     Specific Agreement/Initiative
    1. China                     :   Johnson Line as the border demarcation
    2. Bangladesh               :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
    3. Maldives                  :   Operation Neer (water crisis assistance)
    4. Singapore                 :   Project Nexus (cross-border payments)

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the pairs 2, 3, and 4 accurately reflect specific agreements and initiatives within the context of India's bilateral relations.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative project between India and Bangladesh.  Operation Neer was a significant humanitarian initiative by India to address a water crisis in the Maldives.  Project Nexus represents a key fintech collaboration between India and Singapore to facilitate cross-border payments.

Option (a) is incorrect because while India considers the Johnson Line as its boundary with China, the statement is an oversimplification of a complex and disputed border issue.  China does not accept this line. The question asks for correctly matched pairs. This pair is not fully correct.

Option (b) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair involving Singapore and Project Nexus.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate pairing of India and China regarding the Johnson Line.


**2. With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative        Key Feature/Member
    1. UNTOC (Palermo Convention) :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
    2. BIMSTEC                    :   Legal personality acquired in 2024
    3. SAARC                      :   Largely dysfunctional since 2016
    4. GlobE Network              :   India elected to steering committee


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is indeed supplemented by initiatives like the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) under the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC).  BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) officially acquired legal personality after the ratification of its charter in 2024. SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) has been largely inactive and ineffective since 2016 due to various political and diplomatic tensions. Finally, India's election to the steering committee of the GlobE Network is a recent development.

Therefore, all options except (d) are incomplete and incorrect.


**3. With reference to energy cooperation in South Asia, consider the following pairs:**

    Country Pair                  Energy Project/Initiative
    1. India-Bangladesh           :   Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct because the pairs 1 and 2 accurately reflect energy projects and initiatives between the respective countries. The Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor is indeed a planned initiative between India and Bangladesh.  The Arun III hydropower project is a significant collaboration between India and Nepal.

Pair 3 is incorrect because the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a petroleum pipeline between India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the TAPI (Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India) pipeline does not involve the Maldives.  The TAPI pipeline is a natural gas pipeline.


**4. With reference to India's military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

    Exercise Name                 Participating Countries
    1. Exercise Al Najah V          :   India-Oman
    2. Exercise Eastern Bridge VII   :   India-Thailand

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 3 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 1, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Exercise Al Najah V is a joint military exercise between India and Oman. Exercise Zayed Talwar is a naval exercise between India and the UAE.

Pair 2 is incorrect; Exercise Eastern Bridge VII is between India and Oman, not Thailand.  Pair 4 is incorrect; Exercise MAITREE is between India and Thailand, not Malaysia.


**5. With reference to  India's foreign policy initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                     Key Characteristic/Partner
    1. International North-South Transport Corridor :   Connects India to Russia via Iran
    2. Voice of Global South Summit   :   India's "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" philosophy
    3.  Global Development Compact    :   Focuses on reducing debt burden of developing nations
    4.  Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative :   Bangladesh is a participating nation


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 and 2 only
    (b) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (c) 2, 3, and 4 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The International North-South Transport Corridor indeed aims to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran and Central Asia. The Voice of Global South Summit is a direct reflection of India's "Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam" philosophy, emphasizing a global community. India's proposed Global Development Compact focuses heavily on addressing the debt burdens of developing nations.  Bangladesh is a participant in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.  Therefore, option (d) is the only correct answer.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

3. SIMBEX 2024                       : Singapore and India
4. Exercise MAITREE                   : India and Thailand
5. Exercise Udara Shakti               : India and Malaysia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5
(d) 2, 3 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched.  Exercise Al Najah V is a joint military exercise between India and Oman. Exercise Zayed Talwar is a naval exercise between the UAE and India. SIMBEX 2024 is a maritime bilateral exercise between Singapore and India. Exercise MAITREE is a joint military exercise conducted between India and Thailand.  Finally, Exercise Udara Shakti is a joint air exercise between India and Malaysia.  Therefore, all five pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) represent accurate pairings of military exercises with their respective participating countries.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The comprehensive nature of the correct answer (c) demonstrates a thorough understanding of India's bilateral military collaborations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

JIMEX 2024, a bilateral Japan-India Maritime Exercise, commenced at Yokosuka, Japan, making pair 1 correct. Exercise Dharma Guardian, a joint military exercise between the Indian Army and Japan, is conducted annually and alternates between India and Japan, hence pair 2 is correct. Exercise Mitra Shakti is an annual military exercise between India and Sri Lanka, making pair 3 correct.  However, Exercise Malabar is a multinational maritime exercise involving Australia, Japan, the United States, and India, and its location rotates.  The description in pair 4 is therefore inaccurate because it doesn't specify a single location.  Finally, IMT TRILAT-2024 involves India, Mozambique, and Tanzania; thus, pair 5 is partially correct in stating the participation of Mozambique and Tanzania. Option (a), (b) and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly include pair 4 which is not a fully accurate match. The correct option (c) demonstrates a precise understanding of the locations and participants involved in the exercises.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Exercise Tarang Shakti is a multinational air exercise hosted by India. Khaan Quest is a multinational military exercise conducted in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise among the Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies. RIMPAC Exercise is the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India participates. Exercise Cutlass Express is a multinational maritime exercise led by U.S. Naval Forces, in which the Indian navy participated in Seychelles.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair. Option (c) demonstrates complete knowledge of the participating countries in each multinational exercise listed.  This highlights a comprehensive understanding of India's participation in global military collaborations.

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are correctly matched. India and China agreed to disengagement and resume patrolling in the Depsang Plains and Demchok areas. India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Nepal.  India is involved in the Kurichu Hydroelectric Project in Bhutan.  Finally, there is a Joint Committee Meeting regarding the Malaysia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA). Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly exclude one or more correctly matched pairs. The selection of option (c) demonstrates a comprehensive grasp of India's specific initiatives and agreements with its neighboring countries, showcasing a strong understanding of its foreign policy engagements.

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command are both tri-services commands.  The National Security Council (NSC) is indeed headed by the Prime Minister. The National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) is responsible for appointing the Additional National Security Advisor. Finally, the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, grants specific powers to Commanders-in-Chief of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs). Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  The selection of (c) shows a complete understanding of the structure and functions of India's key national security organizations and related legislation.  This demonstrates a strong understanding of India's security architecture.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The provided text explicitly states that China was India's largest trading partner in goods in 2023.  This directly confirms the accuracy of pair 1.  Furthermore, the text mentions that Bangladesh considers India its second-largest trading partner in Asia, making pair 2 correct. Finally, the passage details that India is Bhutan's top trading partner, validating pair 3. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. This question tests factual recall of economic relations between nations.  The inclusion of Bhutan, a smaller trading partner, adds a layer of difficulty, requiring a more thorough reading of the source material.  The distractors are plausible because they involve countries with significant trade relationships in the region, testing the candidate's ability to discern precise details from general knowledge.

(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, Vientiane is the capital of Lao PDR, Manila is the capital of the Philippines, and Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates.  Option (a) is incorrect as Dushanbe is the capital of Tajikistan, not Uzbekistan. Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan. Options (a) and (b) are therefore incorrect due to this single mismatch. Option (d) incorrectly includes Uzbekistan, which is wrongly paired with Dushanbe.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities, a common element in UPSC examinations.  Understanding the geographical locations of these countries and their capitals is crucial for comprehending international relations and geopolitical dynamics.  The inclusion of plausible distractors such as Dushanbe (Tajikistan's capital) makes this question challenging.  The carefully chosen distractors test the candidate's ability to accurately recall specific details, highlighting the importance of precise factual knowledge in the UPSC exam context.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  China was India's largest trading partner in goods in 2023.  India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh. The other options are incorrect because Singapore's largest trading partner is not specifically stated as India in the provided text, and while Malaysia and Vietnam have trade relationships with many countries, their largest trading partners are not specified as China and Singapore respectively in the given text.  This question tests the understanding of international trade relationships and necessitates the precise recall of trading partnerships. The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the candidate’s ability to distinguish between strong trade relationships and the designation of a "largest" trading partner, a critical skill for analysis of economic relations in the UPSC context.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct.  India's relationship with Singapore and Australia were elevated to Comprehensive Strategic Partnerships in 2024 and 2020 respectively.  Option (b) is incorrect because Malaysia's partnership with India is described as "Enhanced Strategic Partnership," not a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. Option (c) is incorrect because  Vietnam's partnership with India is described as a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership", not simply a "Strategic Partnership". Option (d) is incorrect due to the inaccuracies in the descriptions of the partnerships with Malaysia and Vietnam. This question tests understanding of the nuances in India's foreign policy and requires accurate recall of the type and year of establishment of various partnerships. The carefully constructed distractors highlight the importance of precise detail and understanding of the evolving nature of international relations, a key aspect of the UPSC syllabus.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies China as India's largest trading partner in goods for the year 2023.  This reflects the significant volume of trade between the two nations, although it also highlights a substantial trade deficit for India.  The second pair is also correct; India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, reflecting India's significant economic influence and investment in Bhutan's development.  Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because while India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, it is not its largest.  Bangladesh's largest trading partner varies depending on the year and the type of goods considered. This highlights the complexities of international trade and the importance of understanding the nuances of bilateral economic relationships.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading options.

3. Bangladesh                   :   Chittagong Port

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Vadhvan Port project, mentioned in the text, is indeed being developed in Maharashtra, making the first pair correct.  Chittagong is a major port in Bangladesh, making the third pair correct.  The inclusion of Male Port for the Maldives is a distractor; while Male is the capital and has port facilities, the passage does not explicitly state it as a 'major' port in the same context as the others.  The question tests the candidate's ability to identify correct pairings based on the specific information provided, distinguishing between major ports and general port facilities.  Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings based on the information in the provided text.  Other options incorporate distractors to test the candidate’s understanding of the subject matter.

**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

   River (Bhutan)                Flows Into
1. Amo Chu                        :   Assam

(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Manas River flows into Assam, and the Amo Chu (referred to as Torsa in West Bengal) flows into West Bengal.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of Bhutanese geography and river systems.  The correct answer is (d) because both the Manas River flowing into Assam and the Amo Chu (Torsa) flowing into West Bengal are accurately depicted.  Option (a) is incorrect as Amo Chu flows into West Bengal, not Assam.  Option (b) is incorrect as both Manas and Torsa are correctly matched with their respective destinations. Option (c) is incorrect because Amo Chu flows into West Bengal, not Assam.  The inclusion of seemingly similar river names and destinations acts as a distractor, making careful analysis crucial for correct identification.

   International Treaty/Convention                        Key Provision/Focus
1. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention                 :   Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.
2. 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention                 :   Prohibits the development and use of chemical weapons
3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court :   Established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
4. Geneva Conventions of 1949                         :  Focuses primarily on the protection of victims of international armed conflicts.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention explicitly prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, aiming to prevent their use in warfare.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention similarly bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the mandate to prosecute individuals for the gravest international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  While the Geneva Conventions of 1949 address various aspects of international humanitarian law, including the protection of victims of international armed conflicts, Protocol I of 1977 specifically focuses on this aspect.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.  Option (d) accurately reflects the primary focus of the three conventions and the statute.  Pair 4 is partially correct as the Geneva Conventions cover much more than just Protocol I, making it a less precise match than the others. However, given the options, (d) is the best answer.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                     Key Activity/Focus
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                   :  Combats money laundering and terrorist financing through Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs).
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)   : Primarily focuses on illicit nuclear trafficking monitoring.
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)            :   Releases annual reports on global drug abuse and illicit trafficking.
4. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)                      : Conducts operations like Operation Crimson Barracuda to combat drug trafficking.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's core function is assessing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing globally, using MERs as a key tool. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) engages in multinational naval operations, including counter-narcotics efforts such as Operation Crimson Barracuda.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute the key activities of the UNODC and IAEA. The UNODC's mandate is broader than just illicit nuclear trafficking, encompassing drug control and crime prevention. While the IAEA does have an Incident and Trafficking Database, its work extends far beyond just illicit nuclear material, covering nuclear safety, security, and the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.  The IAEA does not release reports on global drug abuse; that is the UNODC's responsibility.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                         Core Purpose/Provision
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002   :  Grants special powers to armed forces in disturbed areas.
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967   : Primarily addresses money laundering and terrorist financing.
3. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958    :  Deals with unlawful activities threatening national security.
4. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000              :  Regulates the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA) grants special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas" to maintain public order. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is the Indian legislation implementing the international Chemical Weapons Convention, aiming to prevent the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  The PMLA, 2002, is not directly related to granting special powers to the armed forces; instead, it focuses on preventing money laundering. The UAPA, 1967, is concerned with unlawful activities that threaten the country's security, not primarily money laundering and terrorist financing (although these are aspects it covers). Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Body                                      Key Characteristic/Function
1.  Commonwealth of Nations                              :  Decisions are made by consensus among equal members.
2.  UN Security Council (UNSC)                           :  Has the power to make binding decisions for member states.
3.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)          :  Primarily focuses on supporting low-income countries in infrastructure development.
4.  Group of Friends (GOF) on Peacekeepers              :  Aims to combat transnational organized crime (TOC).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth of Nations operates on the principle of consensus-based decision-making, where all member states are considered equal.  The UN Security Council possesses the power to issue binding resolutions that member states must adhere to under the UN Charter. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is a multilateral development bank that focuses on financing infrastructure projects, particularly in developing countries, including low-income ones.  The Group of Friends on Peacekeepers aims to enhance accountability for crimes committed against UN peacekeepers.  The statement about the GOF combating TOC is incorrect; its focus is on protecting peacekeepers. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched, making (b) the correct answer.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Program                  Core Objective/Focus

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Atoms4Food uses nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural productivity and improve global food security. Atoms4NetZero focuses on applying nuclear technologies to help countries achieve net-zero emissions goals. The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles is dedicated to advancing nuclear reactor technologies.  The description of Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action as focusing on sustainable port infrastructure is incorrect; it integrates nuclear science into managing zoonotic diseases. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Convention         Feature
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)       :   India is not a signatory
2. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)        :   Conducts peer reviews of member countries' anti-money laundering measures
3. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024
4. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Operates the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
5. Universal Postal Union (UPU)             :   Is not a specialized agency of the United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed a global body that assesses countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through mutual evaluations.  The UNODC, as its name suggests, focuses on drug control and crime prevention, and regularly publishes reports, including the World Wildlife Crime Report.  The IAEA maintains the ITDB to monitor and report on illicit nuclear trafficking.  Pair 1 is incorrect; India *is* a signatory to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000. Pair 5 is also incorrect; the UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations.  The other options are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair. Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the incorrectly matched pair 1. Option (c) omits the correctly matched pair 3. Option (d) includes the incorrectly matched pairs 1 and 5.  This question tests factual recall and analytical skills, requiring the candidate to identify the accurate pairings among several plausible but ultimately incorrect options.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Key Provision/Focus
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Primarily deals with unlawful activities related to terrorism
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Focuses on preventing money laundering
3. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 :   Grants special powers to armed forces in designated areas
4.  Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994:  Governs organ donation from only brain-dead patients


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, grants special powers to the armed forces in areas declared as "disturbed areas."  Pair 1 is incorrect; while the PMLA addresses money laundering, its primary focus is not on terrorism-related activities.  The UAPA, mentioned in pair 2, is the act primarily concerned with unlawful activities, including terrorism. Pair 4 is incorrect because the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues Act, 1994 allows harvesting from both living donors and brain-dead patients.  The other options are incorrect as they include at least one mismatched pair. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of specific legislation, demanding precise knowledge of the focus of each law.

2.  Group of Seven (G7) Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) :   Aims to improve food security
3.  "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative        :   A G7-led effort to facilitate clean energy investment in Africa
4.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council :  Focuses solely on crisis response to supply chain disruptions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is indeed a G7-led effort aimed at facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa. Pair 1 is incorrect; the PGII has a broader scope than just African clean energy projects; it aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations globally. Pair 2 is incorrect; the G7 FSOI focuses on ocean health and sustainability, not food security.  Pair 4 is incorrect because the IPEF Supply Chain Council has a broader mandate than just crisis response; it also aims to strengthen critical supply chains.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs. This question tests the candidate's ability to recall and differentiate between various international initiatives, demanding precise knowledge of their objectives and scopes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :  Known for high levels of cannabis production
2. Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)       :  Renamed as "Death Triangle" due to drug trafficking
3. Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)     :  A region of significant opium production
4.  India                                            :  Has a comprehensive refugee policy


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent are indeed known for their significant roles in drug trafficking and opium production, respectively, and have been renamed "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent" due to the severity of the situation.  Pair 1 is partially correct in that the Triple Frontier Area is associated with drug trafficking, but its primary association isn't specifically with cannabis production.  Pair 4 is incorrect; India does not have a formal, codified refugee policy.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes one correctly matched pair. Option (c) includes only one correctly matched pair. Option (d) includes an incorrectly matched pair. This question assesses knowledge of geographical regions and their association with specific issues, testing both factual recall and the ability to interpret information accurately.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, Abu Dhabi is the capital of the United Arab Emirates, Vientiane is the capital of Laos, and Manila is the capital of the Philippines.  Option (a) is incorrect because Nairobi is the capital of Kenya, not Somalia; Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia. Options (a) and (b) are partially incorrect due to the mismatching of Somalia's capital. Option (d) includes the incorrect pairing of Somalia and Nairobi, making it entirely false.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities, a common element in UPSC examinations.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like Nairobi (a major African capital) increases the difficulty level and assesses the candidate's precise knowledge.


**2. With reference to geographically significant locations, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                               Description
1. Gulf of Aden                           :   Connects the Red Sea to the Mediterranean Sea
2. Lake Turkana                           :   Africa's largest permanent desert lake
3. Mount Kilimanjaro                       :   Highest peak in South America
4. Lipulekh Pass                          :   Tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan
5. Suez Canal                             :   Connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct because Lake Turkana is indeed Africa's largest permanent desert lake, and the Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas. Option (1) is incorrect; the Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea to the Arabian Sea, not the Mediterranean. Option (3) is incorrect; Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa, not South America. Option (4) is incorrect; Lipulekh Pass is a tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal, not Bhutan. Option (c) includes the incorrect pairing of Lipulekh Pass, while (d) includes multiple incorrect pairings. This question tests knowledge of geography and requires careful evaluation of each pair to eliminate incorrect matches, highlighting the importance of precise geographical knowledge in the UPSC exam.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Region                         Disputed Claimants
1. Abu Musa Island                       :   Iran and Saudi Arabia
2. Senkaku Islands                       :   China and Japan
3. Saint Martin's Island                 :   Bangladesh and India
4. Nagorno-Karabakh Region             :   Armenia and Azerbaijan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are disputed between China and Japan, and Nagorno-Karabakh is a region disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Option (1) is incorrect; Abu Musa Island is disputed between Iran and the UAE, not Saudi Arabia. Option (3) is incorrect; Saint Martin's Island is disputed between Bangladesh and Myanmar, not India.  Option (c) and (d) include these incorrect pairings. This question assesses knowledge of geopolitical disputes and requires careful analysis of each pair, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of international relations in the UPSC context. The inclusion of plausible distractors tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar geopolitical situations.


**4. With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative               Description/Focus
1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank :   Primarily focuses on assisting high-income countries
2. Arab League                          :   Held its 2024 summit in Jordan
3. Colombo Process                       :   India chaired its first meeting in 2024
4. Colombo Security Conclave (CSC)      :   Recently included Sri Lanka as its fifth member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only option 3 is correctly matched. The Colombo Process did indeed have its first meeting chaired by India in 2024.  Option 1 is incorrect; the AIIB aims to assist low-income countries, not high-income ones. Option 2 is incorrect; the 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Jordan. Option 4 is incorrect; Bangladesh, not Sri Lanka, recently joined the CSC as its fifth member.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their activities. The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring the candidate to possess specific knowledge about each organization to arrive at the correct answer.  The question highlights the importance of staying updated on current affairs related to international relations for UPSC preparation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                 Bordering Water Body
1. Turkiye                               :   Black Sea
2. Ukraine                               :   Caspian Sea
3. Thailand                              :   Andaman Sea
4. Vietnam                               :   South China Sea
5. Japan                                 :   Sea of Japan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. Turkiye borders the Black Sea, Thailand borders the Andaman Sea, Vietnam borders the South China Sea, and Japan borders the Sea of Japan. Option (2) is incorrect; Ukraine borders the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov, but not the Caspian Sea.  Options (b) and (c) are therefore incorrect because they include the incorrect pairing of Ukraine with the Caspian Sea.  This question tests knowledge of geography and requires the candidate to accurately identify the bordering water bodies of several countries.  The question’s difficulty arises from the need for precise geographical knowledge and the inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors.  This type of question is common in UPSC examinations, assessing the candidate's ability to recall and apply geographical information.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative           Key Feature/Initiative
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)          :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on money laundering
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)   :   Atoms4Food program
4. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)   :   Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) which assess countries' measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation.  Option 1 is correctly matched.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) focuses on drug control, crime prevention, and criminal justice. While it produces numerous reports, the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is associated with the International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Therefore, option 2 is incorrectly matched.

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does have an Atoms4Food program that uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security. Option 3 is correctly matched.

The Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), which monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking, is a key program of the IAEA, not the ITU.  Therefore, option 4 is incorrectly matched.  The ITU's focus is on information and communication technologies.


**2. With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                       Specific Focus/Activity
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)       :   Critical Mineral Dialogue
2. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)     :   Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024-2029
3. Group of Seven (G7)                         :   "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative
4. ASEAN + 3                                   :   ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) indeed includes a Critical Mineral Dialogue to address supply chain resilience and collaboration on critical minerals.  Option 1 is correctly matched.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has adopted an Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024-2029 as part of its efforts to combat drug trafficking and related crimes within the member states.  Option 2 is correctly matched.

The Group of Seven (G7) has launched the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative to support clean energy development and investment in the African continent.  Option 3 is correctly matched.

The ASEAN + 3 mechanism, which includes ASEAN countries plus China, Japan, and South Korea, does not directly manage the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA). AITIGA is a bilateral agreement between ASEAN and India. Option 4 is incorrectly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Area of Focus
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Combating terrorism
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Combating money laundering
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000           :   Prohibition of chemical weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is primarily designed to combat money laundering, not terrorism directly, although terrorist financing often involves money laundering.  Option 1 is incorrectly matched.

The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, focuses on preventing unlawful activities, including terrorism, but not specifically money laundering. Option 2 is incorrectly matched.

The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, implements India's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. Option 3 is correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's international collaborations, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Initiative                             Participating Countries/Organizations
1.  Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement (ENNPIA) :   India, US, UK
2.  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal   :    India and all SAARC nations
3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)                 :    India, US, UK, and several other nations
4.  Project Nexus                                   :   India and Singapore

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ENNPIA is a trilateral agreement between India, the US, and the UK concerning the sharing of sensitive technology related to naval nuclear propulsion.  Option 1 is correctly matched.

The MLAT portal facilitates international cooperation in criminal justice matters, but it's not limited to SAARC nations. India has MLATs with numerous countries beyond SAARC. Option 2 is incorrectly matched.

India's participation in the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) involves collaboration with several nations, including the US and UK, to enhance maritime security. Option 3 is correctly matched.

Project Nexus is a collaborative initiative between India and Singapore focused on cross-border payments. Option 4 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region/Area                                      Significance Related to Drug Abuse
1. Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle)          :   Cocaine production
2. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :   Cannabis cultivation
3. Golden Crescent (now Death Crescent)           :   Opium production

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Golden Triangle, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is historically significant for opium production, although other drugs are also produced there. Option 1 is incorrectly matched.  Cocaine is more strongly associated with South America.

The Triple Frontier Area, located where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is known for drug trafficking and money laundering involving various drugs but particularly cocaine and cannabis. Option 2 is incorrectly matched; although cannabis is involved it is not the primary focus.

The Golden Crescent, encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, is a major region for opium production. Option 3 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement             Key Feature/Related Entity
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on India's anti-money laundering measures
2.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :   Jagjit Pavadia's re-election for a third term
4.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) :   Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) does indeed conduct Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) to assess countries' efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  India's MER was a key news item.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) is a separate treaty, and while the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) – its secretariat –  has many initiatives, the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is not directly linked to the UNTOC itself.  The UNODC has its own separate initiatives.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is accurately stated. The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) did launch the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region Associated with Drug Abuse               Specific Drug of Concern
1.  Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :   Cocaine
2.  Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)     :   Amphetamines
3.  Death Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)     :   Cannabis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

While all three regions are indeed associated with significant drug trafficking and abuse, the provided text highlights Cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy. The text does not specifically link each region to a single predominant drug.  The Triple Frontier Area is known for its cocaine trafficking, making statement 1 correct. The other statements lack definitive support from the provided information.  The Golden Triangle and Death Crescent are associated with multiple illicit substances, not solely amphetamines and cannabis respectively. Therefore, only pair 1 is definitively correct based on the text.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                      Key Focus Area
1.  Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)           :   Regional Anti-Terrorist Structure
2.  United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) :   Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT)
3.  India-UN Development Fund (Commonwealth Sub Window):   Achieving gender equality (SDG 5)
4.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)      :   Women's political representation in local governance

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) does indeed have a regional anti-terrorist structure as a key component. The United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT) explicitly focuses on countering the financing of terrorism. The India-UN Development Fund, with its Commonwealth Sub-Window, is correctly linked to supporting initiatives related to achieving gender equality, aligning with SDG 5. The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) explicitly works to support women's full and active participation in public life, especially in local governance, directly relating to SDG 5. All four pairs accurately reflect the organizations' key focus areas.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention                 Subject Matter
1.  Biological Weapons Convention (1972)            :   Prohibition of chemical weapons
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)            :   Prohibition of biological weapons
3.  Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (1998) :   War crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (1972) prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, not chemical weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Rome Statute (1998) established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Pairs 1 and 2 have the subject matter incorrectly assigned to the conventions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                     Specific Bilateral Agreement/Initiative with India
1.  Bangladesh                                      :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
2.  China                                          :   Disengagement in Depsang Plains and Demchok areas
3.  United States                                  :   Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA)
4.  Nepal                                           :   Arun III Hydropower Project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India and Bangladesh have jointly undertaken projects like the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant.  India and China have recently agreed on disengagement in the Depsang Plains and Demchok areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  India and the United States have a Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) in place.  India and Nepal have cooperative projects such as the Arun III Hydropower Project.  All four pairs represent accurate pairings of countries/regions with specific bilateral agreements or initiatives involving India.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Trade Agreement             Key Feature
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   Signed in 2009, aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2. South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement :  Focuses on enhancing economic ties between South Asian nations.
3. Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore :   India is a net importer under this agreement.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  AITIGA, signed in 2009, explicitly aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and India.  SAFTA, the South Asian Free Trade Area Agreement, similarly focuses on reducing trade barriers and fostering economic cooperation within South Asia. The CECA between India and Singapore, while a broader agreement covering various aspects of economic cooperation, does indeed show India as a net importer under its framework. Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the key features of the respective regional trade agreements.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Key Initiative
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)       :   Includes a Supply Chain Council focused on strengthening critical supply chains.
2.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)        :   Adopted the ‘On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development’ initiative.
3.  Group of Seven (G7)                           :   Launched the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative to facilitate clean energy investments.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The IPEF, as mentioned, features a Supply Chain Council dedicated to enhancing the resilience of critical supply chains. The SCO, at its 24th summit, endorsed the “On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development” initiative.  Finally, the G7 has indeed spearheaded the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative to attract external investment for clean energy projects on the continent.  Therefore, the correct option is (d), as all three pairs accurately link the organization to its stated initiative. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement            Key Feature/Outcome
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)            :   Adopts Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assessing countries' measures to combat money laundering.
2.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)           :   India is a signatory and enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The FATF's core function involves evaluating member countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures through MERs. The UNODC, as stated, published the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.  India's ratification of the CWC and subsequent enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, are also accurately reflected.  Therefore, option (d) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and inaccurate, failing to encompass all the correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Bilateral Agreement/Initiative               Key Aspect
1.  India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement  : Amounts to $75 billion.
2.  India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) : Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN.
3.  India-China Relations                          :  China is India's largest trading partner in goods.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The India-Japan bilateral Currency Swap Agreement is indeed valued at $75 billion.  Furthermore, the statement that China is India's largest trading partner in goods is also accurate. However, pair 2 is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trading partner for India, it's not necessarily India's *largest* trade partner within ASEAN.  The largest trade partner within ASEAN for India may vary from year to year depending on trade volumes. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are definitively correct, making (c) the appropriate answer. Options (a), (b), and (d) are either incomplete or include an incorrect pairing.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                 Significant Feature/Event
1.  Japan                                        :  Composed of four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu.
2.  Cuba                                         :  Featured in the Non-Aligned Movement's call for its removal from a US list.
3.  Singapore                                     :  Largest source of FDI into India in 2023-2024.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The geographical composition of Japan with its four main islands is a well-established fact. Cuba's inclusion in the Non-Aligned Movement's statement regarding its removal from a US list is also accurate. Finally, Singapore's position as the largest source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) into India during 2023-2024 is also supported by data. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing all three correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and fail to reflect the accuracy of all three pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                     Participating Countries
1. IBSAMAR VIII                       :   India, Brazil, and Argentina
2. RIMPAC Exercise                    :   India, USA, UK, Australia, Canada
3. Exercise Cutlass Express            :   India, Seychelles, and France
4. Exercise Orion                      :   India, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, UK, Spain, and USA
5. Desert Flag                         :   UAE, France, Kuwait, Australia, UK, Bahrain, Morocco, Spain, South Korea, and USA

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise among India, Brazil, and South Africa, not Argentina.  RIMPAC, while involving India, is far more extensive than the listed countries; many more nations participate. Exercise Cutlass Express includes the Indian Navy but prominently features U.S. Naval Forces and other nations in the East African region, not just India, Seychelles, and France. Exercise Orion correctly lists the participating countries.  Desert Flag also accurately reflects the participating air forces. Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to inaccuracies in the pairings of military exercises with their respective participating countries.  Understanding the scope and participants of these multinational exercises is crucial for comprehending India's strategic partnerships and defense collaborations.


**2. With reference to multinational military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

   Exercise Name                       Type of Exercise
1. Operation Southern Readiness     :   Bilateral Air Exercise
2. Operation Sadbhav                  :   Unilateral Humanitarian Aid
3. Tiger Triumph 2024                :   Bilateral Tri-Service HADR Exercise
4. Exercise Malabar                   :   Annual Quadrilateral Maritime Exercise
5. Exercise Freedom Edge              :   Trilateral Multi-domain Exercise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Operation Southern Readiness is an annual multinational maritime exercise, not a bilateral air exercise. Operation Sadbhav is a humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operation launched by India, but it is multilateral, not unilateral. Tiger Triumph 2024 is indeed a bilateral tri-service HADR amphibious exercise between India and the US. Exercise Malabar is an annual maritime exercise between Australia, Japan, the United States, and India (Quadrilateral). Exercise Freedom Edge is correctly identified as a trilateral multi-domain exercise between South Korea, the US, and Japan. Therefore, options 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect because they misclassify the type or participants of the exercises.  Understanding the nature and objectives of these exercises is key to analyzing India's strategic partnerships and defense postures.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Bilateral Exercise                   Participating Countries
1. Exercise Al Najah V                :   India and Pakistan
2. Naseem-Al-Bahr                   :   India and Oman
3. Exercise Eastern Bridge VII        :   India and Sri Lanka
4. Exercise Zayed Talwar              :   India and UAE
5. SIMBEX 2024                       :   India and Singapore

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Al Najah V is a joint military exercise between India and Oman, not Pakistan. Naseem-Al-Bahr is correctly matched as a naval exercise between India and Oman. Exercise Eastern Bridge VII is between the Indian Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Oman, not Sri Lanka. Exercise Zayed Talwar is accurately described as a naval exercise between India and the UAE. SIMBEX 2024 is correctly paired with India and Singapore. Thus, only pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The other options are incorrect due to the misidentification of participating countries in some of the exercises. The knowledge of these bilateral exercises is crucial in understanding India's defense relationships with various nations in its strategic neighborhood.


**4. With reference to India's military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

   Exercise Name                       Nature of Exercise
1. Exercise Maitree                    :   Bilateral Air Exercise
2. Exercise Udara Shakti               :   Bilateral Air Exercise
3. Exercise Samudra Laksamana         :   Bilateral Naval Exercise
4. JIMEX 2024                         :   Trilateral Naval Exercise
5. Dharma Guardian                     :   Bilateral Army Exercise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) Only 3 and 5
(d) All of the above

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Maitree is a joint military exercise, not solely an air exercise, between India and Thailand. Exercise Udara Shakti is correctly identified as a joint air exercise between India and Malaysia. Exercise Samudra Laksamana is accurately described as a bilateral naval exercise between India and Malaysia. JIMEX 2024 is a bilateral maritime exercise between India and Japan, not a trilateral one. Dharma Guardian is correctly matched as a joint military exercise between the Indian Army and Japan.  Therefore, only options 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched. The other options incorrectly classify the nature or participants of the exercises.  Understanding the type and participants of these exercises is important for analyzing India's defense cooperation with various countries.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Multilateral Exercise                Participating Countries (Partial List)
1. Exercise Tarang Shakti             :   Australia, Bangladesh, France, Germany
2. Khaan Quest                         :   India, Mongolia, and China
3. IBSAMAR VIII                       :   India, Brazil, South Africa, and Russia
4. Exercise Malabar                    :   India, USA, Japan, Australia, and UK
5. IMT TRILAT-2024                    :   India, Mozambique, Tanzania, and South Korea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Tarang Shakti correctly includes Australia, Bangladesh, France, and Germany among its participants. Khaan Quest involves India and Mongolia, but China's participation is not confirmed. IBSAMAR VIII does not involve Russia; it is limited to India, Brazil, and South Africa. Exercise Malabar is accurately represented by the listed countries, though it often involves other partners. IMT TRILAT-2024 correctly lists India, Mozambique, and Tanzania. South Korea is not a participant. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are partially correct in terms of the listed participants.  The other options incorrectly include exercises where the listed participants are not fully accurate.  Awareness of these multilateral exercises is essential for understanding the scope of India's defense collaborations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization          Specific Initiative/Program
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) :   Critical Mineral Dialogue
2. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Atoms4NetZero
3. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)      :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
4.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) indeed includes a Critical Mineral Dialogue as one of its initiatives, focusing on mapping mineral resources and fostering collaboration.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a program called Atoms4NetZero, aiming to promote nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Finally, while UNODC has many programs, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) is a regional initiative under its umbrella, indicating a correct match.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of international organizations and their specific programs, requiring knowledge beyond just the names of the organizations themselves.  Understanding the mandates and activities of these bodies is crucial for a deeper grasp of global governance and international cooperation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative          Key Feature/Member
1.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)  :   Belarus joined as the 10th member
2.  Group of Seven (G7)                     :   Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
3.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) :   India has a trade deficit with ASEAN.
4.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)         : Operation Crimson Barracuda


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO is a significant development expanding its membership. The G7's PGII is a key initiative aimed at funding infrastructure projects globally.  ASEAN's trade relationship with India shows a consistent trade deficit for India, a relevant economic fact. Finally, Operation Crimson Barracuda was conducted under the CMF, demonstrating India's active participation in this multinational initiative.  The other options are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations, their activities, and significant events related to them.  The diverse range of organizations included – from regional security groups to economic alliances – assesses a broad understanding of global affairs.  The inclusion of specific initiatives like PGII and Operation Crimson Barracuda requires more than surface-level knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention    Specific Provision/Outcome
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)   :   India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.
2.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  5th Joint Committee Meeting held in Jakarta.
3.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) :   India elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council.
4.  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)      :    BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs represent accurate linkages. India's ratification and implementation of the CWC are reflected in the domestic legislation. The AITIGA review meeting in Jakarta is a verifiable fact. India's role as Vice-Chair in the IPEF's Supply Chain Council is also accurate. However, the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement is a separate agreement under the BRICS framework, not a direct feature of general CSAs.  Therefore, only the first three pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair. This question evaluates knowledge about international treaties and agreements and their practical implications.  It requires a nuanced understanding of the specific details of these agreements and their operational aspects, moving beyond simply knowing their names.  The inclusion of both economic and security-related agreements assesses a comprehensive understanding of international relations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                 Location/Year of Establishment/Event
1.  World Gold Council (WGC)              :   Established in 1987
2.  International Seabed Authority (ISA)    :   Headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica
3.  BIMSTEC                               :   Permanent Secretariat in Dhaka, Bangladesh
4.  Colombo Security Conclave             :   Founded by India, Sri Lanka, and Maldives


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The World Gold Council was indeed established in 1987. The International Seabed Authority has its headquarters in Kingston, Jamaica. BIMSTEC's permanent secretariat is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  And finally, the Colombo Security Conclave was initially founded by the three countries mentioned.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched.  The other options are incorrect as they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. This question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of international organizations and their geographical and historical context.  The focus on establishment years and locations tests detailed recall beyond simple identification.  The mix of economic (WGC) and geopolitical (Colombo Conclave, ISA) organizations demands a broad understanding of global institutions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Key Programme/Initiative
1. IAEA                                         :   Atoms4NetZero (promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions)
2. ITU                                          :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3. UNODC                                       :   SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network)
4. FATF                                         :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on money laundering and terrorist financing
5.  OPEC+                                      :  Extension of deep oil output cuts into 2025


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) indeed has a key program called Atoms4NetZero, focused on promoting the role of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions targets.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024,  a significant initiative to assess global cybersecurity preparedness. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing. OPEC+, a group comprising OPEC members and other oil-producing nations,  agreed to extend its deep oil output cuts, impacting global energy markets. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  However, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) is not directly associated with the UNODC; while UNODC supports wildlife crime efforts, SAWEN is a regional initiative with its own independent structure and governance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                    Key Provision/Focus
1. Geneva Conventions of 1949                     :   Protection of cultural property during armed conflict
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)            :    Prohibition of the use of chemical and biological weapons
3. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)          :   Elimination of chemical weapons and prevention of their future use
4.  Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Prosecution of individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the mandate to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. This is a core function accurately reflecting the treaty's purpose.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) focuses on the elimination of chemical weapons and preventing their future use, not chemical and biological weapons, which is a combined concern of the CWC and the Biological Weapons Convention. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, not the elimination of chemical weapons.  The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are concerned with the protection of victims of war (civilians, wounded soldiers, prisoners of war), not cultural property, which is protected under a separate convention. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                  Key Feature/Objective
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Combats money laundering and terrorist financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000         :   Implementation of the CWC's provisions in India
4. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 :   Empowers Commanders-in-Chief of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA of 2002 is crucial legislation for combating money laundering in India, though FIU-IND was established earlier. The UAPA of 1967 deals with unlawful activities and terrorism, not specifically money laundering.  The Chemical Weapons Convention Act of 2000 is the Indian domestic law implementing the obligations under the international Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The Inter-services Organizations Act of 2023 grants significant powers to the Commanders-in-Chief of Inter-Services Organizations. Thus, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                   Significant Conflict/Issue
1. Israel                                          :   Reopening of the Erez crossing for humanitarian aid to Gaza
2. Yemen                                           :    Conflict between Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government (Saudi-backed)
3.  Georgia                                        :   Conflict involving Chechen separatists
4. Turkey                                          :    Conflict related to control over the Red Sea
5.  India                                          :    Operation Sankalp to ensure safety of Indian vessels


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Israel's recent actions involve the reopening of the Erez crossing to facilitate humanitarian aid to Gaza. Yemen is embroiled in a protracted civil war between Houthi rebels and the internationally recognized government, with significant backing from Saudi Arabia. India launched Operation Sankalp to safeguard its vessels in the region.  However, Georgia's conflicts primarily involve separatist movements in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, with Russian involvement, not Chechen separatists. The Red Sea conflict is primarily associated with Yemen and the Houthi rebels, not Turkey directly. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Armed Conflict/Region                        Key Operational Name/Initiative
1. Kargil War                                     :   Operation Talwar (Indian Navy)
2.  India's response to the conflict in the Red Sea : Operation Safed Sagar (Indian Air Force)
3.  India's efforts against transnational organized crime: Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
4.  Counter-terrorism operations                : Operation Crimson Barracuda (Indian Navy)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Operation Talwar was indeed a key naval operation during the Kargil War. Operation Crimson Barracuda, conducted by the Indian Navy, signifies India's participation in combating drug trafficking. However, Operation Safed Sagar was an Air Force operation during the Kargil War, not a response to the Red Sea conflict. The Generation Justice initiative is part of the UN's efforts against transnational organized crime, not a specific Indian military operation.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                Key Feature/Provision
1. Geneva Protocol 1925                       :   Prohibits the use of biological weapons
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)          :   Adopted in 1993, entered into force in 1997
3.  Outer Space Treaty 1967                    :   Bans weapons of mass destruction in orbit
4.  Biological Weapons Convention 1972        :   Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices.  While it doesn't explicitly mention biological weapons in its original text, its broad interpretation often includes them under the umbrella of prohibited weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), adopted in 1992 and entering into force in 1997, comprehensively bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction in orbit, on celestial bodies, or in outer space. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention explicitly prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. Thus, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the Geneva Protocol which has a broader interpretation regarding biological weapons. Option (b) is incorrect because the CWC's adoption and enforcement dates are misrepresented. Option (c) is incorrect as it omits the Geneva Protocol's relevance to biological weapons.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                  Key Programme/Initiative
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU):   Atoms4Food
3. UNODC                                     :   Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's key programmes focus on nuclear safety, security, and peaceful uses of nuclear energy, including Atoms for Peace and Atoms4Food. The ITU focuses on telecommunications and information and communication technologies, and its key initiative is the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI).  The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) works on combating transnational organized crime, including initiatives such as the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA). Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly associate programs with organizations.  The distractors are designed to test knowledge of the mandates and activities of these different international organizations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention/Treaty                     Subject Matter
1. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:   Combating Money Laundering
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002:   Disciplinary powers over inter-services personnel
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000   :   Regulation of chemical weapons
4.  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA):   Internal Security in Specified Areas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, grants disciplinary and administrative powers to commanders of inter-services organizations. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, deals with money laundering, not disciplinary matters. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, implements India's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 (AFSPA), grants special powers to armed forces in specified areas for maintaining public order. Hence, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly link Acts to different subject matters, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific mandates of each legislation.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation/Programme               Description/Objective
1. Operation Vijay                           :   Blockade of Pakistan's navy
2. Operation Safed Sagar                     :   Targeting Pakistani troops in Kargil
3. Operation Talwar                          :   Eviction of Pakistani soldiers and militants from Kargil
4. Operation Crimson Barracuda               :   Seizure of drugs in the Arabian Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Operation Vijay was the overall Indian military operation to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Kargil sector. Operation Safed Sagar was the Indian Air Force's operation to target Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions during the Kargil War. Operation Talwar was the Indian Navy's operation to blockade Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea during the Kargil War. Operation Crimson Barracuda was a multi-national operation conducted by the Indian Navy resulting in a drug seizure. Therefore, pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly associate operations with their objectives or descriptions, testing the candidate's knowledge of specific military operations and their contexts.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative        Focus Area
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       :   Combating Wildlife Crime
2.  World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS):   Digital Infrastructure Development
3.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC): Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing
4.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)         : Counter-terrorism and maritime security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  While UNODC touches upon this area, its broader mandate encompasses drug control and crime prevention. The World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) focuses on the information society and digital development, including digital infrastructure. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational naval coalition focused on counter-terrorism and maritime security operations.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.

(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The capital of Mauritius is correctly identified as Port Louis.  Kigali is the accurate capital city of Rwanda. Option (a) is incorrect because Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka, not the Maldives (Malé). Option (c) is incomplete, omitting the correct pairing for Mauritius. Option (d) is incorrect because Accra is the capital of Ghana, not Togo (Lomé). This question assesses factual recall of capital cities, a fundamental aspect of general knowledge frequently tested in the UPSC exam.  The inclusion of plausible distractors like Colombo and Accra tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar-sounding or geographically proximate locations.

India's Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, implements the Chemical Weapons Convention, aiming to prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002, primarily focuses on preventing money laundering, not illicit drug trafficking.  Combating drug trafficking is the domain of other legislation and agencies. Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.

The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, grants special powers to the armed forces in designated areas to maintain public order and security. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. Only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Program                           Primary Goal

3.  INDUS-X                                  Facilitate partnerships among US and Indian defense companies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques and isotopes to enhance agricultural productivity, improve food safety, and strengthen food security globally.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) is a non-treaty based arrangement focused on promoting cooperation among Indo-Pacific nations for a free, open, and rules-based regional order. Therefore, pair 2 is correctly matched.

INDUS-X, launched under the Critical and Emerging Technologies (iCET) initiative, aims to foster collaboration between US and Indian defense companies, research institutions, and investors to boost the defense industrial base. Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched.  All three pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                    Capital City
1. Uzbekistan                 :   Dushanbe
2. Thailand                   :   Bangkok
3. Lao PDR                    :   Vientiane
4. Philippines                :   Manila
5. Democratic Republic of Congo :   Kinshasa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, Vientiane is the capital of Lao PDR, Manila is the capital of the Philippines, and Kinshasa is the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo.  Option (a) is incorrect as Dushanbe is the capital of Tajikistan, not Uzbekistan (Tashkent). Option (b) is partially correct but omits the correct pairing for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrect pairing of Uzbekistan and Dushanbe.  The question tests factual recall of capital cities, a common element in UPSC geography and general knowledge sections. The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge to eliminate them.  The inclusion of multiple correct pairs increases the difficulty level and necessitates careful consideration of each option.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographical Feature          Location
1. Lake Turkana                  :   Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro             :   Tanzania
3. Lipulekh Pass                 :   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal                    :   Panama
5. Gulf of Aden                  :   Between Red Sea and Arabian Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania. Lipulekh Pass is in Uttarakhand, India. The Gulf of Aden correctly connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. Option (a) is incorrect because it excludes the correct pairing of the Gulf of Aden.  Option (c) is wrong because it incorrectly places the Suez Canal in Panama; the Suez Canal is in Egypt. Option (d) is incorrect due to the misplacement of the Suez Canal. The question assesses knowledge of geographical locations, a crucial element in UPSC geography examinations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options, such as the Suez Canal's location, enhances the difficulty and tests the candidate's precise geographical awareness.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Gas Field                     Location
1. Galkynysh Gas Field         :   Southeastern Turkmenistan

3. Shah Deniz Gas Field          :   Azerbaijan
4. Groningen Gas Field          :   Netherlands
5.  Urengoy Gas Field           :    Russia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Galkynysh gas field is located in southeastern Turkmenistan. The South Pars gas field is in Iran. The Shah Deniz gas field is in Azerbaijan. The Groningen gas field is in the Netherlands. The Urengoy gas field is in Russia.  This question tests the knowledge of major gas fields and their locations, demonstrating an understanding of global energy resources and geopolitics, relevant to UPSC examinations. All options except (d) act as distractors, testing the candidate's comprehensive knowledge of gas field locations. The inclusion of several well-known gas fields increases the question's difficulty and prevents simple guessing.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                   Activity/Report
1. Reporters Without Borders      :   World Press Freedom Index
2. World Bank                     :   Global Employment Trends for Youth Report
3. International Labour Organisation :   Global Economic Prospects Report
4. UNESCO                        :   Kalinga Prize for Popularisation of Science
5.  International Monetary Fund   :  World Development Indicators

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4 and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Reporters Without Borders (RSF) publishes the World Press Freedom Index. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) releases the Global Employment Trends for Youth Report. UNESCO awards the Kalinga Prize for the Popularization of Science. The World Bank publishes the World Development Indicators. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) publishes the World Economic Outlook.  Option (a) is incorrect because it incorrectly attributes the Global Employment Trends for Youth Report to the World Bank.  Option (c) is incorrect due to the misattribution of the Global Economic Prospects Report to the ILO. Option (d) is incorrect as it wrongly attributes the Global Economic Prospects Report to the ILO and the World Economic Outlook to the IMF. The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their respective publications, relevant for UPSC current affairs and general awareness sections. The distractors are carefully chosen to highlight potential misconceptions and require a strong understanding of the different organizations’ roles.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Island/Island Group         Disputed Claimants
1. Abu Musa Island              :   Iran and UAE
2. Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu)     :   Japan and China
3. Chagos Islands               :   UK and Mauritius
4. Spratly Islands              :   China and Vietnam
5.  Kuril Islands               :   Russia and Japan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (c)


**Explanation:**

All five pairs correctly identify the disputing nations over each island or island group. Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the UAE. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu) are disputed between Japan and China. The Chagos Islands are a subject of contention between the UK and Mauritius. The Spratly Islands are claimed by several nations, including China and Vietnam. The Kuril Islands are disputed between Russia and Japan. This question tests knowledge of territorial disputes, a critical aspect of international relations and geopolitics frequently examined in the UPSC. The inclusion of multiple island groups with similar characteristics increases the difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge. All options except (c) act as distractors, demanding precise knowledge to eliminate them.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization             Specific Programme/Initiative
1. IAEA                                   :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
2. ITU                                    :   Atoms4Food
3. UNODC                                 :   Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
4. FATF                                   :   World Drug Day Report
5.  BRICS                               :   Contingent Reserve Arrangement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct matches are 3 and 5.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking,  and the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payment issues. These are accurately paired with their respective organizations.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) is published by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not the IAEA.  Option 2 is incorrect as Atoms4Food is an IAEA program, not an ITU initiative. Option 4 is incorrect; while FATF does produce reports, the World Drug Day Report is published by the UNODC. The question uses plausible distractors by mixing programs and initiatives from different organizations, demanding accurate knowledge of each organization's specific activities to arrive at the correct answer.  This makes the question challenging and tests the examinee's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding international initiatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional/International Grouping        Specific Initiative/Outcome
1.  G7                                    :   SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking
2.  BIMSTEC                               :   Wilmington Declaration
3.  SCO                                   :   Belarus joining as a member
4.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)   :   Operation Crimson Barracuda
5.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)     :   Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Wilmington Declaration was adopted at a Quad Leaders' Summit (Quad is a grouping of which India is part), and Belarus's accession to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a recent development.

Option 1 is incorrect; the SAARC Convention is not a G7 initiative. Option 4 is incorrect: Operation Crimson Barracuda is an Indian Navy operation under the Combined Maritime Forces, not related to the IMEC. Option 5 is incorrect because Bangladesh, not the CMF, joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of regional and international groupings and their key initiatives, requiring precise recall of facts to avoid being misled by plausible distractors. The inclusion of seemingly related but incorrect pairings necessitates careful analysis and evaluation of each option.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention/Agreement              Relevant Organization/Body
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000:   International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
2.  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)        :   Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
3.  Palermo Convention                    :   Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)
4.  Atoms4NetZero                        :   International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
5.  Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 :  UNODC


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) Only one
(d) Only two


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) adopts Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), the Palermo Convention falls under the purview of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), and Atoms4NetZero is an initiative of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

Option 1 is incorrect; the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is related to the implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, not the INCB. Option 5 is incorrect because the Inter-services Organisations Act is an internal Indian act unrelated to the UNODC. The question challenges the candidate's understanding of international conventions, agreements, and their associated bodies, requiring both factual recall and the ability to correctly link specific instruments to their respective organizations.  The inclusion of plausible distractors necessitates a detailed knowledge of the subject matter.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                       Specific Development/Event
1.  Bangladesh                          :   Kargil War Victory
2.  India                                :   First Grain ATM 'Annapurti' inaugurated in Bhubaneswar
3.  Kazakhstan                           :   24th SCO Summit
4.  Italy                                 :   India elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council
5.  Singapore                            :   FATF plenary meeting adopting India's MER


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) Only one


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The 24th SCO summit was held in Kazakhstan, and the FATF plenary meeting where India’s MER was adopted took place in Singapore.

Option 1 is incorrect: The Kargil War is an Indian event. Option 2 is incorrect; the inauguration of Annapurti was in Odisha, India. Option 4 is incorrect; India's election as Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council was not directly linked to Italy (although the IPEF itself has multiple member states, including Italy). The question assesses the candidate's understanding of recent events in various countries and regions, demanding precise recall of locations and events to avoid being misled by plausible distractors. The inclusion of seemingly relevant but incorrect pairings makes the question difficult and tests detailed knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organisation/Treaty          Focus Area
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       : Combating human trafficking
2.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Monitoring illicit nuclear trafficking
3.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Combating money laundering and terrorist financing
4.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)      :  Prohibition of chemical weapons development and use
5.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Drug abuse and illicit trafficking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, not human trafficking.  The UNODC's mandate is broad, encompassing drug control, crime prevention, and criminal justice, but it does not directly monitor illicit nuclear trafficking; that falls under the IAEA's purview.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) specifically tracks nuclear material theft and trafficking. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) explicitly prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties, directly relating to drug abuse and illicit trafficking.  Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) incorrectly associate organizations with areas outside their primary mandates, highlighting common misconceptions about international bodies and their functions.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                   Key Provision/Feature
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :  Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :  Combats money laundering and terrorist financing
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000           :  Focuses on illicit wildlife trade
4.  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, 2022: Facilitates international cooperation in criminal investigations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA, while aimed at preventing money laundering, does not establish the FIU-IND; the FIU-IND was established separately in 2004. The UAPA is primarily concerned with unlawful activities, including terrorism, but is not directly involved in combating money laundering and terrorist financing in the way the PMLA is. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 implements the international CWC, focusing on chemical weapons, not wildlife trade. The MLAT portal enhances international cooperation in criminal matters, including investigations, which aligns with its purpose. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 correctly connect the act/legislation with its core function. Options (a), (b), and (c) include incorrect pairings based on either conflating the roles of different bodies or misrepresenting the legislative focus.


**3.  With reference to international organizations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                                  Description/Focus
1.  BIMSTEC Charter                                    :  Facilitates cross-border electricity trade between Nepal, India, and Bangladesh.
2.  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) :  Focuses on combating Transnational Organized Crimes (TOC).
3.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002:  Outlines goals and structure for BIMSTEC.
4.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ):  A network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities.
5.  SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network):  Works towards regional cooperation on wildlife crime.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The BIMSTEC Charter is a foundational document defining the organization's structure and goals, not directly related to cross-border electricity trade. The GlobE network aims to strengthen international cooperation in combating corruption, not TOC specifically. The SAARC convention addresses trafficking in women and children, not the framework for BIMSTEC. The CCPCJ focuses on crime prevention and criminal justice, including TOC. SAWEN is a regional initiative focused on wildlife crime enforcement. Therefore, only pairs 4 and 5 accurately reflect the organization's or initiative's mandate. Options (a), (b), and (c) contain mismatched pairs due to a misunderstanding of the organizations' or initiatives' functions and scope.  The distractors are carefully designed to exploit potential confusion between related but distinct international efforts.


**4. With reference to India's international engagements, consider the following pairs:**

    International Agreement/Initiative                      Key Feature/Participation
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council: India is a Vice-Chair.
2.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)   :  Aims to improve food security and sustainable agriculture.
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)            :  India is the largest member in terms of population
4.  Group of Seven (G7) Summit                           :  Belarus recently joined as a member.
5.  The Commonwealth                                   : India hosted the CHOGM in 1983


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IPEF Supply Chain Council accurately reflects India's Vice-Chair position.  The IMEC focuses on enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, not food security.  The SCO does not include India as its largest member by population; that statement is incorrect.  Belarus's recent entry into the SCO is accurate.  India's hosting of CHOGM in 1983 is also correct.  Hence, only pairs 1 and 5 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, playing on the potential for candidates to confuse India's involvement in various international bodies and their specific functions. The distractors are crafted to test detailed knowledge of specific facts about India's engagement in these different forums.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country          Largest Trading Partner (Goods, 2023)
1. India             China
2. Bangladesh       India
3. Bhutan            India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because all three pairs accurately reflect the largest trading partner in goods for the respective countries in 2023.  China was India's largest trading partner in goods during 2023, indicating a significant trade relationship despite existing border tensions.  Similarly, India was Bangladesh's second largest trading partner in Asia, highlighting the strong economic ties between the two nations.  For Bhutan, India remains the dominant trading partner, reflecting the close economic and developmental cooperation between the two countries.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these correctly matched pairs, failing to capture the complete picture of the largest trading partners for these South Asian nations.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country          Significant Bilateral Initiative
1. Maldives         Operation Neer
2. Bangladesh       Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
3. Bhutan            Gelephu Mindfulness City

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Operation Neer, a humanitarian initiative by India, provided crucial water assistance to the Maldives during a water crisis, reflecting India's commitment to its neighbor. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant signifies India-Bangladesh energy cooperation and enhanced connectivity.  The planned Gelephu Mindfulness City highlights the expanding infrastructural and economic cooperation between India and Bhutan.  Therefore, option (d) accurately reflects the significant bilateral initiatives mentioned in the context of each country's relationship with India.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Project     Participating Countries
1. Arun III            India & Nepal
2. Upper Karnali      India & Bhutan
3. Kurichu             India & Bhutan
4. TAPI Pipeline       India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the participating countries in the mentioned energy projects. Arun III and Kurichu are hydropower projects involving India and Bhutan. The TAPI pipeline is a multinational gas pipeline project involving India, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Turkmenistan.  Option (a) incorrectly excludes the TAPI pipeline. Option (c) incorrectly excludes Arun III and Kurichu. Option (d) is incorrect because Upper Karnali is a project involving India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan.  Understanding the geographical location and participating nations is crucial for comprehending the regional energy dynamics and India's role in South Asian energy security.


**4. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following pairs:**

    Country Pair     Electricity Corridor/Project
1. India-Bangladesh   Katihar-Bornagar corridor
2. India-Nepal        Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline
3. India-Bhutan        Chukha Hydropower Project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct as it accurately links the India-Bangladesh electricity corridor to the Katihar-Bornagar project and the India-Bhutan cooperation to the Chukha Hydropower Project. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline, while relevant to India-Nepal energy cooperation, is a natural gas pipeline, not an electricity corridor.  Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly pair the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline with electricity trade.  This question tests the knowledge of specific energy projects and their locations, highlighting the intricacies of regional energy cooperation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   River              Country/Region
1. Jamuna            Bangladesh
2. Amo Chu           Bhutan
3. Omo River          Kenya

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Jamuna River is a major river in Bangladesh, forming part of the Brahmaputra River system. The Amo Chu River flows through Bhutan.  The Omo River is located in Ethiopia, not Kenya. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either incorrectly include or exclude the correct pairings. This question assesses knowledge of geographical features and their locations, important for understanding regional contexts and geopolitical dynamics.


**6. With reference to India's participation in international forums, consider the following pairs:**

   Forum Name              India's Role/Action
1. Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative    Bangladesh joined the initiative
2. BBIN                      Nepal's non-participation
3. Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)  Participation in Sri Lanka meeting

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched.  Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative reflects India's expanding diplomatic reach. Nepal's decision not to endorse the BBIN initiative highlights the complexities of regional cooperation. India's active participation in the CLGF meeting demonstrates its commitment to local governance and gender equality within the Commonwealth framework. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they fail to capture the full extent of India's involvement in these forums. This question tests the knowledge of India's engagement in various multilateral platforms and its approach to regional cooperation.

(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because Thimphu (Bhutan), Dhaka (Bangladesh), Kathmandu (Nepal), and Beijing (China) are correctly paired with their respective countries.  Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka, not Maldives. The inclusion of Colombo as a distractor in the pairs tests the examinee's knowledge of capital cities in South Asia, a common area of focus in UPSC examinations. The other options incorrectly include the Maldives-Colombo pairing, demonstrating a lack of accurate geographical knowledge.  A strong understanding of South Asian geography is essential for UPSC aspirants, and this question effectively assesses that understanding by presenting plausible but incorrect alternatives.  The question also tests the candidate's ability to identify and eliminate incorrect pairings, a crucial skill in data interpretation and analysis.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. The Yangtze River is in China, the Manas River flows through Bhutan, and the Jamuna River (a part of the Brahmaputra) flows through Bangladesh. The Omo River is located in Ethiopia, not Kenya; and the Koshi River flows through Nepal and India.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of major rivers in Asia, specifically focusing on the geographical location of rivers within specific countries.  The inclusion of the Omo and Koshi rivers as distractors serves to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related geographical entities.  Incorrect options highlight potential misconceptions regarding river systems in South Asia, effectively evaluating the depth of the candidate's geographical understanding.  This question emphasizes the importance of detailed knowledge of geographical features for success in the UPSC examination.


**3. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Location
1. Reporters Without Borders (RSF)             Paris
2. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)   Vienna
3. UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)       New York
4.  Mercosur                                    Buenos Aires
5. Colombo Process                             Colombo

(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is the correct answer. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is based in Paris, Mercosur's headquarters are in Montevideo, Uruguay (though various meetings may take place in Buenos Aires). The UNODC is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.  The Colombo Process is indeed based in Colombo. The question tests knowledge of the location of important international organizations and regional blocs. The inclusion of incorrect locations and organizations serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to accurately recall the headquarters of these bodies.  The question evaluates the candidate’s understanding of international organizations and their geographical locations, a crucial aspect of international relations for the UPSC.  The placement of UNODC in New York is a deliberate distractor, playing on the potential confusion with other UN bodies.


**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                 Country
1.  Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation   Nepal
2. Currency Swap Agreement                Bhutan
3.  Operation Neer                        Maldives
4.  Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade     Bangladesh
5.  "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" award     Bhutan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Operation Neer provided water assistance to the Maldives during a crisis. The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade facilitates trade between India and Bangladesh.  The "Order of the Druk Gyalpo" is Bhutan's highest civilian award.  The Treaty of Peace and Friendship is between India and Nepal, not just India and Bhutan. The Currency Swap Agreement was signed with the Maldives, not Bhutan. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific agreements and initiatives within India's bilateral relations. The inclusion of incorrect pairings and the strategic placement of plausible distractors test the candidate's ability to discriminate between similar initiatives and their respective countries. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's foreign policy and its engagements with neighboring countries, an important area of focus for the UPSC.


**5. With reference to geographical locations, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                            Description
1. Lake Turkana                        Largest permanent desert lake in the world
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                   Highest peak in Africa
3. Suez Canal                           Connects Mediterranean and Red Sea
4. Lipulekh Pass                        Tri-junction of India, China, and Bhutan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas. The Depsang Plains are situated southeast of Daulat Beg Oldie. However, Lake Turkana, while a large desert lake, is not the largest *permanent* desert lake globally; and Lipulekh Pass is a tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal, not Bhutan. This question tests the candidate's geographical knowledge, specifically focusing on the accurate identification and description of various locations. The inclusion of slightly incorrect descriptions and the careful selection of distractors test the candidate's ability to recall precise details and differentiate between closely related geographical features.  The question highlights the importance of precision in geographical knowledge for the UPSC.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct. The South Pars Gas Field is located in Iran, the Shah Deniz Gas Field is in Azerbaijan, and the Urengoy Gas Field is in Russia. The Gorgon Gas Field is located in Australia, and the Dauletabad Gas Field is in Turkmenistan.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of major global gas fields and their locations. The inclusion of less well-known gas fields as distractors tests the candidate's depth of knowledge and ability to recall specific geographical locations. Incorrect pairings highlight potential misconceptions regarding the geographical distribution of energy resources, a topic of increasing relevance in international relations and economics. This question demonstrates the importance of detailed knowledge of global energy resources and their locations for the UPSC.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Largest Trading Partner (Goods, 2023)
1. India                       :   China
2. Nepal                      :   India
3. Bhutan                     :   India
4. Bangladesh                 :   India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies China as India's largest trading partner in goods for the year 2023, reflecting the significant trade volume between the two nations.  This is a well-established fact in international trade statistics.  Similarly, the pairing of Nepal and India accurately reflects India's dominant position in Nepal's trade relations, a consequence of geographical proximity and historical ties.  The statement also correctly matches Bhutan with India as its largest trading partner.  Bhutan's economy is significantly integrated with India's, leading to a substantial trade relationship.  However, Bangladesh's largest trading partner is not India. While India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh, other countries such as China and other Asian nations contribute significantly to its trade volume, making India not its largest trading partner. This makes option (d) incorrect. Options (a) and (b) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                      Highest Source of FDI
1. Nepal                      :   India
2. Bhutan                     :   India
3. Maldives                   :   India

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Explanation:**

India is a major source of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) for Nepal, Bhutan, and the Maldives.  This is due to several factors, including historical ties, development assistance programs, and economic collaborations.  India's significant investment in infrastructure projects, hydropower development, and other sectors within these countries makes India the leading source of FDI.  The options (a) and (b) are incomplete, failing to capture the full extent of India's influence as a major FDI source for these nations. Option (d) is not provided in this format.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                      Capital City
1. Nepal                      :   Kathmandu
2. Bhutan                     :   Thimphu
3. Maldives                   :   Malé
4. Bangladesh                 :   Dhaka

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal, Thimphu is the capital of Bhutan, Malé is the capital of the Maldives, and Dhaka is the capital city of Bangladesh.  These are well-known and easily verifiable facts about the respective countries.  All options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.



**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

Country                      Treaty/Agreement
1. Nepal                      :   Treaty of Peace and Friendship, 1950
2. Bhutan                     :   Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, 1949 (renewed 2007)
3. Bangladesh                 :   Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT)
4. Maldives                   :   Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a country with a significant treaty or agreement governing aspects of their relationship with India.  The Treaty of Peace and Friendship (1950) forms the basis of India-Nepal relations, while the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (1949, renewed 2007) underpins the close ties between India and Bhutan.  The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) facilitates trade and transit between India and Bangladesh, and the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) contributes to economic stability and cooperation between India and the Maldives. Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**5. With reference to South Asian energy cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

Country Pair                 Energy Project/Pipeline
1. India-Nepal                :   Arun-3 Hydro Electric Project
2. India-Bhutan               :   Kurichu Hydroelectric Project
3. India-Bangladesh           :   India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline
4. India-Turkmenistan        :   TAPI Gas Pipeline

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect energy projects and pipelines connecting India with its South Asian neighbors. The Arun-3 Hydroelectric Project is a joint initiative between India and Nepal, Kurichu is a hydroelectric project in Bhutan built with Indian collaboration, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports petroleum products, and the TAPI pipeline (although involving Turkmenistan) directly benefits India through its South Asian connectivity.  Therefore, all options other than (d) are incorrect.


**6. With reference to India's border disputes, consider the following pairs:**

Region                        Disputed Line/Agreement
1. Ladakh (Western Sector)  :   Johnson Line
2. Arunachal Pradesh (Eastern Sector) :   McMahon Line
3. Middle Sector (Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand) :  Undisputed

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

The Johnson Line represents India's claim to the border in the Ladakh region of the Western Sector, while the McMahon Line is the basis of India's claim in the Eastern Sector, encompassing Arunachal Pradesh.  The Middle Sector, encompassing parts of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, is largely undisputed between India and China.  All three pairs accurately reflect the status of the border in these regions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore partially correct, but not fully comprehensive.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

River                           Basin
1. River Kali                   :   Kali Valley

3. Manas River                  :   Assam
4. Jamuna (Brahmaputra)      :   Bangladesh

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

The River Kali flows through the Kali Valley, a key area in the India-Nepal border dispute. The Amo Chu river, also known as Torsa, flows into West Bengal, India. The Manas River flows into Assam, India.  The Jamuna, a major distributary of the Brahmaputra, flows through Bangladesh. All these river-basin pairings are factually accurate. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

Lake/Mountain               Location
1. Lake Turkana               :   Kenya and Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro          :   Tanzania

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is situated in both Kenya and Ethiopia, Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, and Pangong Tso is a trans-border lake situated in Ladakh (India) and Tibet (China).  All three pairs accurately represent the geographical location of these features.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**9. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization/Initiative     Relevant Area
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Combating Transnational Organized Crime
2. South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN):   Wildlife Crime
3. Colombo Process          :   Refugee and Migration Issues
4. Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network :  Anti-Corruption

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly link the organization or initiative with its primary area of focus.  UNTOC is a crucial international treaty aimed at combating transnational organized crime, SAWEN specifically focuses on wildlife crime in South Asia, the Colombo Process addresses refugee and migration issues in the region, and the GLOBE Network works to enhance anti-corruption efforts globally.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**1. With reference to international organizations combating transnational crime, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Initiative/Feature
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
3. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) :   Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
4. Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) :   Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only.  The Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) did indeed launch the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice. This is a well-documented initiative of the CCPCJ.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is a key initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), not the FATF.  The FATF focuses primarily on combating money laundering and terrorist financing through mutual evaluations and setting international standards.

Option 2 is incorrect because while the UNODC is involved in combating drug trafficking and related crimes, the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) is a process specifically used by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to assess countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Option 4 is incorrect because the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) is an initiative undertaken by the UNODC, not GlobE. GlobE, a network of anti-corruption law enforcement authorities, focuses on enhancing international cooperation in fighting corruption.  The UNODC, with its broader mandate, undertakes assessments of transnational organized crime threats.


**2. With reference to India's international collaborations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Specific Agreement/Initiative
1. Bangladesh                               :   Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative
2. Singapore                                 :   Project Nexus (linking UPI with other FPSs)
3. Vietnam                                   :   Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)
4. ASEAN                                     :   India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only.  Singapore and India's collaboration on Project Nexus, aimed at connecting their domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) for faster cross-border payments, is accurately matched. This initiative is a significant aspect of their fintech cooperation.

Option 1 is incorrect. While India and Bangladesh share strong bilateral relations encompassing various areas of cooperation, Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is not a direct bilateral agreement between the two countries.  The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a broader multilateral framework involving several nations.

Option 3 is incorrect.  India has a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) with Singapore, not Vietnam. India's economic relations with Vietnam are important but do not involve a CECA.

Option 4 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a bilateral initiative solely between India and Bangladesh, not a collaboration involving ASEAN as a whole.  ASEAN is a regional grouping of Southeast Asian nations.


**3. With reference to international organizations and their roles, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Key Function/Focus
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)      :   Combating Transnational Organized Crime
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)   :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)              :   Atoms4Food initiative
4. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)        :   Promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is indeed responsible for releasing the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), a key part of its efforts to promote cybersecurity globally.

Option 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's focus is on nuclear energy, safety, and non-proliferation, not on combating transnational organized crime. That falls under the purview of organizations like the UNODC and Interpol.

Option 3 is incorrect. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a naval coalition focused on maritime security, not the Atoms4Food initiative.  The Atoms4Food initiative is an IAEA program.

Option 4 is incorrect.  While the SCO addresses various security concerns, its primary focus isn't on promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions. The IAEA plays a more prominent role in that area.  The SCO's focus is broader, encompassing political, economic, and security cooperation among its member states.


**4.  With reference to regional economic cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                                 Key Feature/Participant
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)   :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
2. Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) :   Decisions are made by consensus
3. South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) :   BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity
4.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):   Includes only nations from the Middle East


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only.  The statement that decisions in BIMSTEC are made by consensus is accurate.  This reflects the principle of equal participation among member states.

Option 1 is incorrect because India has a trade deficit, not a surplus, with ASEAN under AITIGA.

Option 3 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is associated with BIMSTEC, not SAARC.  SAARC has its own initiatives related to regional connectivity.

Option 4 is incorrect. The IMEC, as its name suggests, aims for broader connectivity, encompassing India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It's not limited to only Middle Eastern nations.


**5. With reference to India's domestic legislation and international conventions, consider the following pairs:**

   Legislation/Convention                                      Key Purpose/Provision
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)                      :   Combating money laundering
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002         :   Regulating Nidhi Companies
3. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967       :   Prohibition of chemical weapons
4.  Companies Act, 2013 (Section 406)                    :   Preventing terrorist financing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 2 and 4 only. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, aims to combat money laundering, and Section 406 of the Companies Act, 2013, governs Nidhi companies.

Option 1 is incorrect. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) focuses on the prohibition of chemical weapons, not money laundering.

Option 3 is incorrect. While the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) addresses unlawful activities, including terrorism, it doesn't directly prohibit chemical weapons.  The prohibition of chemical weapons is covered by international conventions like the CWC.  The UAPA primarily deals with domestic threats.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative             Key Feature/Member
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process for assessing money laundering measures
2.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Ratified by India
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)       :   Belarus recently joined as the 10th member
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                         :   Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The FATF utilizes a peer-reviewed Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process to assess countries' efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  India is a signatory and ratifying state to the UNTOC, demonstrating its commitment to tackling transnational organized crime.  The SCO recently welcomed Belarus as its tenth member, expanding its regional influence. Finally, the G7 launched the PGII initiative to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations, reflecting its global development goals.  Each pair accurately reflects a key characteristic or membership detail of the respective international organization or initiative. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present in any of the provided pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Bloc/Agreement                      Characteristic/Initiative
1.  ASEAN                                     :   ASEAN Future Forum – India is a founding member
2.  SAARC                                     :   Decisions based on unanimity; largely dysfunctional since 2016
3.  BIMSTEC                                  :   Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024
4.  India-GCC Relations                       :   India has a trade deficit with GCC countries

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key aspects of the respective regional blocs or agreements. The ASEAN Future Forum, indeed, includes India as a founding member, highlighting its engagement in the region. SAARC's decision-making process relies on unanimity, and its functionality has been significantly impaired since 2016 due to various geopolitical tensions. The BIMSTEC Charter's coming into force in 2024 granted the organization legal personality.  Finally, India's trade relationship with the GCC countries shows a consistent trade deficit.  Each pairing is factually accurate and presents a clear and concise representation of the relevant information.  There are no alternative interpretations or conflicting data to consider.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Significant Geographic Feature
1.  United States (US)                           :   Mississippi River (longest)
2.  Japan                                       :   Honshu (largest island)
3.  United Kingdom (UK)                         :   Pennines mountain range
4.  Singapore                                  :  Largest trade partner for India in ASEAN in 2023-24

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The first three pairs are correctly matched.  The Mississippi River is indeed the longest river in the United States. Honshu is the largest of Japan's four main islands. The Pennines mountain range is a significant geographic feature of the United Kingdom.  However, the fourth pair is incorrect. While Singapore is a significant trade partner for India,  its ranking as the largest in ASEAN in 2023-24 needs clarification or further verification.  The other three pairs present clear and undisputed geographical facts.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law                                      Purpose/Provision
1.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Combats money laundering
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000       :  India is a signatory and party
3.  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) :  Imposes sanctions on countries engaging with Russia, North Korea, and Iran
4.  Geneva Conventions of 1949                   :   Cornerstone of International Humanitarian Law (IHL)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The PMLA is explicitly designed to combat money laundering in India. India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act demonstrates its adherence to the international treaty. CAATSA is a US law that imposes sanctions on those engaging with specific adversaries. The Geneva Conventions form the foundation of international humanitarian law. Each pair clearly and accurately links the act or law with its primary purpose or a key provision.  No inaccuracies or ambiguities exist within the provided information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Initiative/Organisation         Focus Area/Outcome
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)    :   Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and Labor Rights Advisory Board
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):   Jagjit Pavadia re-elected for a third term (2025-2030)
3.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ):   Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative to engage youth
4.  BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI): Blockchain-based payment service


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The IPEF established the three bodies mentioned for supply chain resilience. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is a documented fact.  The CCPCJ's launch of the GenJust initiative is a confirmed event.  The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative uses blockchain technology. Each pair directly and accurately reflects the initiative's focus or a significant outcome.  No conflicting information or alternative interpretations are present.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Largest Trading Partner (Goods, 2023)
1. India                       :   China
2. Bangladesh                 :   India
3. Bhutan                      :   India
4. Singapore                   :   India
5. Vietnam                     :   China


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that China was India's largest trading partner in goods in 2023 is correct, reflecting a significant trade imbalance.  Similarly, India being Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia is also accurate, highlighting the strong economic ties between the two nations.  However, while India is a major trading partner for Bhutan, it is not necessarily Bhutan's *largest* trading partner;  this position may fluctuate.  The assertion regarding Singapore and Vietnam's largest trading partners is incorrect. While India is a major trading partner for Singapore, it's not the largest globally;  similarly, while China is a significant trading partner for Vietnam, it's not necessarily the largest. These inaccuracies demonstrate the complexity of international trade relationships and the dynamic nature of trade partnerships, which can shift based on various economic and geopolitical factors.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are definitively correct based on the provided information.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                Major Hydroelectric Project(s) Built with Indian Assistance
1. Bhutan               :   Arun III, Upper Karnali
2. Nepal                 :   Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, Mangdechhu
3. Bangladesh            :   Arun III, Upper Karnali
4. India                  :   Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, Mangdechhu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bhutan has several major hydroelectric projects built with Indian assistance, including Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu.  These projects are crucial for Bhutan's energy security and contribute significantly to its economy.  The projects mentioned in relation to Nepal (Arun III and Upper Karnali) are indeed significant hydropower projects in Nepal, but they are not built with Indian assistance.  The projects listed for Bangladesh are also inaccurate.  The projects listed in relation to India are the Bhutanese projects, indicating a mismatching of countries and projects. Therefore, only the pair associating Bhutan with the correctly listed hydroelectric projects is accurate.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization              Key Initiative/Program
1. IAEA                    :   Atoms4NetZero
2. UNODC                  :   SAWEN
3. FATF                     :   GLOBE Network
4. ITU                      :   Atoms4Food


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative focuses on promoting nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions, accurately reflecting its role in advancing nuclear technology for sustainable development.  However, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) is associated with regional cooperation on wildlife crime, not UNODC.  The GLOBE Network is related to anti-corruption efforts, not FATF.  Atoms4Food is an initiative under the IAEA, not ITU.  Therefore, only pair 1 accurately connects the organization with its key initiative.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Country             Military Exercise with India
1. Singapore          :   AUSINDEX
2. Vietnam             :   SIMBEX
3. Australia           :   Agni Warrior
4. USA                 :   Malabar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Malabar exercise is a significant multinational naval exercise involving the navies of India, the USA, Japan, and Australia.  AUSINDEX is a bilateral naval exercise between Australia and India. SIMBEX is a bilateral naval exercise between Singapore and India. Agni Warrior is a bilateral army exercise between India and Singapore. Therefore only the pair linking USA with Malabar is correct. The other pairings incorrectly link countries with exercises conducted with other nations.



**5. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Type of Agreement/Partnership
1. China                     :   Comprehensive Strategic Partnership
2. Bhutan                     :   Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation
3. Australia                  :   Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement
4. USA                        :   Major Defence Partner


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India and Bhutan share a unique relationship based on the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, which reflects their close ties.  The designation of the USA as a Major Defence Partner by India is also accurate, signifying a significant step in their defence cooperation.  However, India and China do not have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and India and Australia have a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement (CETA), not a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, and neither do they have a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The other pairs incorrectly identify the nature of the agreements or partnerships between the countries.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region                                     Country
1. Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent) :   Myanmar
2. Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle) :   Pakistan
3. Triple Frontier Area                       :   Brazil


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Triple Frontier Area is correctly matched with Brazil as one of its constituent countries.  This region, located at the confluence of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, is known for its illicit activities, including drug trafficking.  The other options are incorrect. The Golden Crescent, now often referred to as the Death Crescent, comprises Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran – not Myanmar.  Similarly, the Golden Triangle, also known as the Death Triangle, includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand – not Pakistan.  The incorrect pairings are deliberately designed as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of geographical locations associated with drug production and trafficking.  Understanding the geographical context of these regions is crucial for comprehending global drug trade dynamics and the challenges faced in combating transnational organized crime. The question assesses factual recall and analytical skills in identifying correct geographical pairings related to international drug trafficking hotspots.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                   Activity/Initiative
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)           :   SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network)
3. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                         :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct pairings are 1 and 3.  The UNTOC, while broader in scope, is indeed supplemented by initiatives aimed at tackling specific aspects of transnational organized crime, including the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) under the UNODC.  The FATF's core function involves conducting Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) to assess countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures.  Option 2 is incorrect because, while the UNODC is involved in various anti-crime initiatives, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) is a regional initiative, not directly under the UNODC's umbrella.  The incorrect pairings serve as plausible distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the roles and functions of these various international organizations in global crime prevention and security cooperation.  This question tests factual recall and conceptual understanding of international organizations involved in combating transnational crime.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Country of Origin/Headquarters
1. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :   Canada
2. Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) :   United Kingdom
3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)   :   Russia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the second pair is correctly matched. The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) has its headquarters in the United Kingdom.  The other options contain incorrect information. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is not based in Canada; it's a UN body with headquarters in Vienna, Austria.  The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is headquartered in Beijing, China, not Russia.  The inclusion of these incorrect pairings as distractors tests the candidate's knowledge of the location and organizational structure of key international bodies. The question evaluates factual recall and understanding of the geographical context of international organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention/Agreement                   Focus Area
1. Chemical Weapons Convention                :   Combating money laundering
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) :   Prohibition of biological weapons
3.  BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement       :   Short-term liquidity support


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only the third pair is correctly matched. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement is designed to provide short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payments challenges.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Chemical Weapons Convention focuses on the prohibition of chemical weapons, not money laundering.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) addresses money laundering, not biological weapons. These incorrect pairings serve as strong distractors, testing the candidate’s in-depth understanding of the specific aims and objectives of various international agreements and national legislation. This question tests factual recall and analysis skills related to international cooperation and domestic legal frameworks.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Meeting                                   Participating Entity
1. 16th BRICS Summit                              :   Kazan, Russia
2. India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue :   New Delhi, India
3. Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) Annual Board meeting :   Sri Lanka


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The 16th BRICS Summit was held in Kazan, Russia, and the Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) Annual Board meeting took place in Sri Lanka.  These are correctly matched. Option 2 is incorrect because the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting for Strategic Dialogue, while involving India and GCC countries, was not held in New Delhi.  The inclusion of this geographically plausible, yet factually incorrect pairing as a distractor highlights the need for precise recall of details regarding international events and meetings. The question tests factual recall and analytical skills related to international relations and diplomacy.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Capital City
1.  Bolivia                   :   La Paz
2.  Panama                   :   Panama City
3.  Trinidad & Tobago        :   Port-au-Prince
4.  New Zealand              :   Wellington
5.  Somalia                   :   Mogadishu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bolivia's administrative capital is La Paz, and its constitutional capital is Sucre.  Panama City is the capital of Panama. Port-au-Prince is the capital of Haiti, not Trinidad and Tobago; the latter's capital is Port of Spain. Wellington is indeed the capital of New Zealand. Mogadishu is correctly paired with Somalia. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect capital city pairings, demonstrating a lack of precise knowledge about the capital cities of these nations, a crucial aspect of geographical awareness essential for UPSC preparation.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to identify accurate information amidst plausible distractors.


**2. With reference to geographical locations, consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature          Location
1. Gulf of Aden                :   Between the Red Sea and Arabian Sea
2. Isthmus of Panama           :   Connects North and South America
3. Senkaku Islands             :   Located in the South China Sea
4. Abu Musa Island             :   Disputed between Iran and Oman
5. Lake Turkana                :   Located in South Africa

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf of Aden correctly connects the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. The Isthmus of Panama accurately links North and South America. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are situated in the East China Sea, not the South China Sea. Abu Musa Island is indeed a point of contention between Iran and the UAE (United Arab Emirates), not Oman. Lake Turkana is located in Kenya and Ethiopia, not South Africa. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) contain at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of precise geographical knowledge for UPSC aspirants.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar geographical locations.


**3. With reference to countries and their borders, consider the following pairs:**

Country                      Bordering Country
1. Mexico                     :   Canada
2. Bolivia                     :   Brazil
3. Panama                     :   Costa Rica
4.  Uzbekistan                 :   Kazakhstan
5.  Thailand                   :   Myanmar

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(b) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Mexico shares a border with the USA, not Canada.  Bolivia correctly borders Brazil. Panama shares a border with Costa Rica. Uzbekistan correctly borders Kazakhstan. Thailand correctly borders Myanmar.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) all contain the incorrect pairing of Mexico and Canada, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of international boundaries. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish correct information from plausible distractors.  It tests knowledge of geopolitical relationships.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Island Country              Ocean
1. Tuvalu                     :   Indian Ocean
2. Mauritius                  :   Atlantic Ocean
3. New Zealand               :   Pacific Ocean
4. Trinidad & Tobago         :   Caribbean Sea
5. Chagos Islands             :   Arctic Ocean

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Tuvalu is located in the Pacific Ocean, not the Indian Ocean. Mauritius is situated in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. New Zealand is correctly placed in the Pacific Ocean. Trinidad and Tobago are correctly located in the Caribbean Sea. The Chagos Islands are part of the Indian Ocean, not the Arctic Ocean.  Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Other options incorrectly include at least one island nation's ocean location, highlighting the need for precise geographical knowledge. This question tests factual recall of island locations and their respective oceans.


**5. With reference to bodies of water, consider the following pairs:**

Water Body                Location/Description
1. Red Sea                  :   Connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean
2. Gulf of Oman              :   Bordered by Iran and Pakistan
3. Celebes Sea               :   Located near the Philippines

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) focuses on sustainable, inclusive, and quality infrastructure in developing nations, not sustainable agriculture (option 1 is incorrect). The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is explicitly aimed at facilitating investment in clean energy projects in Africa (option 2 is correct). The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) concerns marine conservation and sustainable ocean management, not infrastructure development (option 3 is incorrect). The Apulia Food Systems initiative, as its name suggests, works to enhance food security and sustainable agriculture (option 4 is correct).  Options (a), (c), and (d) incorrectly include pairings that misrepresent the focus areas of the initiatives listed.  Understanding the specific goals and objectives of each initiative is crucial for correctly matching them to their respective focus areas, showcasing an understanding of international development initiatives and global cooperation.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

International Organization                     Key Report/Initiative
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       : World Drug Day Report
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the second pair is correctly matched. The FATF (Financial Action Task Force) is responsible for issuing Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assessing countries' anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures, not the World Drug Day Report (option 1 is incorrect). The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) publishes the World Drug Day Report and the World Wildlife Crime Report, among others (option 2 is correct). The ITU (International Telecommunication Union), not the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), releases the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) (option 3 is incorrect). Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the roles and responsibilities of these international organizations in the global governance landscape.  A correct answer requires detailed knowledge of the specific activities and publications of each organization.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). Only the third pair is correctly matched. The Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) focuses on banning the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, not combating transnational organized crime (option 1 is incorrect). The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000, directly addresses transnational organized crime, not chemical weapons (option 2 is incorrect). The Biological Weapons Convention (1972) prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons (option 3 is correct). Options (a), (b), and (d) reflect a confusion between the specific aims of these international agreements, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of international law and treaties in the context of global security and cooperation.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following pairs:**

Year                                       Significant Event

3. 2018                                    : India-UN Development Fund established


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Only the first pair is correctly matched.  Belarus joined the SCO in 2024 (option 1 is correct). The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024, not 2022 (option 2 is incorrect). The India-UN Development Fund was established in 2018, unrelated to SCO events (option 3 is irrelevant to the question and therefore incorrect).  Options (b), (c), and (d) contain incorrect pairings, demonstrating the need for precise knowledge of timelines related to international organizations and their activities.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific years associated with significant events in the context of international relations.


**5. With reference to India's international partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative/Agreement                                 Participating Countries/Bodies
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement : Includes India, Australia, and the United States
2.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) : Primarily involves India, Middle Eastern nations, and European Union countries.
3.  Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) : Includes India, Japan, Australia, and the United States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b).  Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement includes more than just India, Australia, and the US; it involves a broader group of Indo-Pacific nations (option 1 is incorrect). The IMEC (India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor) aims to connect India, Middle Eastern countries, and European nations for enhanced economic cooperation (option 2 is correct). The Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) comprises India, Japan, Australia, and the United States (option 3 is correct). Option (a), (c), and (d) contain incorrect information regarding the participating countries/bodies involved in the respective initiatives.  The question assesses the understanding of the geographical and political scope of various international economic and strategic partnerships involving India.


**1. With reference to international organizations combating money laundering and terrorist financing, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Key Feature/Initiative
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)         :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
2. Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) :   Established in 1956
3. Directorate of Enforcement (ED)           :   Launched Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal in 2022

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  This is a core function of the FATF.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) was established in 2004, not 1956.  1956 is the year the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) was established. This is a common distractor, playing on the similar roles and acronyms of the two organizations.

Pair 3 is also incorrect. While the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a crucial role in combating money laundering, the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal was launched in 2022 as a broader government initiative to facilitate international cooperation, not solely under the ED's purview.

Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched, making option (a) the correct answer.  The question tests factual recall about key international organizations and their specific functions, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in international relations and financial crime prevention.


**2. With reference to international initiatives related to infrastructure and investment, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Characteristic
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :  Launched in 2023
2. "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative      :   Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Led by the G20

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) was launched in 2022, not 2023. This slight alteration in the date serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual details.

Pair 2 is correct. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, a G7-led effort, indeed aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 to support clean energy projects in Africa.  This highlights the global effort towards sustainable development and energy access in developing nations.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is a G7 initiative, not a G20 initiative. This error plays on the similar nature of G7 and G20 as international forums, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific organizations involved.

Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various international collaborations and their specific goals, demonstrating an understanding of global development initiatives.


**3. With reference to the UNODC reports and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

1. Annual Report on World Drug Day                   :   Cannabis is the least abused drug globally.
2. World Wildlife Crime Report 2024                 :   Focuses solely on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.
3. Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA):   Developed by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's Annual Report on World Drug Day actually highlights cannabis as the *most* abused drug globally, not the least.  This reversal of information is a significant distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall precise details from reports.

Pair 2 is incorrect. While the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 addresses illegal wildlife trade, it's not limited to Africa; it covers global trends and challenges.  The geographic limitation is a misleading detail designed to test careful reading comprehension.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) is an initiative of the UNODC, not the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).  This substitution of organizations creates a plausible distractor, requiring knowledge of the specific roles of different UN bodies.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question tests knowledge of UNODC reports and initiatives, emphasizing the importance of accurate information recall and understanding of the UN system's structure.

3. Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) :   Sri Lanka


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a bilateral initiative between India and Bangladesh, not Nepal.  The inclusion of Nepal as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of South Asian regional cooperation initiatives.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, not Bhutan.  This substitution of countries tests the candidate's knowledge of specific energy projects in the region.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) is an agreement between India and Bangladesh, not Sri Lanka. This again tests the candidate's understanding of specific bilateral agreements in the region.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of India's bilateral relations, focusing on specific projects and agreements with neighboring countries.  The question demands precise knowledge of India's foreign policy engagements.


**5. With reference to the Commonwealth and India's role, consider the following pairs:**

   Fact                                          Detail

2. India's contribution to the Commonwealth budget :   Second largest
3. India-UN Development Fund's Commonwealth Sub Window :  Funding of $25 million

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The modern Commonwealth's commencement is marked by the London Declaration of 1949, not 1959. This slight variation in the year tests the candidate's ability to recall precise historical details.

Pair 2 is incorrect. India is the fourth largest contributor to the Commonwealth budget, not the second largest. This change in ranking serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of India's financial commitment to the organization.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window established under the India-UN Development Fund received $50 million, not $25 million, over five years. This numerical difference is a key distractor, testing accurate factual recall.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the Commonwealth's history and India's involvement in the organization, requiring precise recall of facts and figures.  It highlights the importance of detail in understanding international organizations and their funding mechanisms.


**6.  With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following pairs:**

3. Economic Development                               :  Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024−2029

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism is a separate document from the SCO Development Strategy until 2035.  The question tests the ability to differentiate between related but distinct initiatives within the SCO framework.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024-2029 addresses drug control, not the Cooperation Program for 2025-2027, which focuses on counter-terrorism.  This deliberate mismatching of initiatives tests the candidate's understanding of the SCO's multifaceted approach to security.

Pair 3 is incorrect. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 covers economic development, but it's not solely dedicated to this area. The Anti-Drug Strategy is a specific initiative, not a comprehensive plan for economic development.  This highlights the need for nuanced understanding of the organization's strategic goals.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's detailed knowledge of the SCO's various initiatives, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between different areas of cooperation within the organization.  It demands precise recall of specific documents and their focus areas.


**7. With reference to the  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its programs, consider the following pairs:**

    Program                                         Key Focus

Pair 2 is incorrect. While the IAEA is involved in managing zoonotic diseases, this is through its Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program, not Atoms4Food.  The substitution of programs tests the candidate's understanding of the IAEA's diverse portfolio.

Pair 3 is incorrect. Atoms4Food, not the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles, uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security.  This mismatching of programs highlights the need for a clear understanding of the IAEA's various initiatives.

Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of the IAEA's programs, demanding precise knowledge of each program's specific focus area.  It underscores the importance of detailed knowledge about international organizations and their activities.


**8. With reference to India's engagement with the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following pairs:**

    Council/Network                                 Key Function
1. Supply Chain Council                             :   Emergency response to supply chain disruptions.
2. Crisis Response Network                          :   Strengthening critical supply chains.
3. Labor Rights Advisory Board                     :   Enhancing labor rights and workforce development.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. The Supply Chain Council under IPEF focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, not on emergency responses.  The swapping of functions between the Supply Chain Council and the Crisis Response Network serves as a key distractor.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The Crisis Response Network under IPEF provides a platform for collective emergency responses to disruptions in supply chains, not on strengthening the chains themselves.  This mismatching of functions tests the candidate's comprehension of the IPEF's structure.

Pair 3 is correct. The Labor Rights Advisory Board under IPEF indeed brings together workers, employers, and governments to enhance labor rights and workforce development in regional supply chains.  This correct matching stands out against the incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to identify the accurate function.

Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the IPEF's structure and the functions of its various councils and networks, emphasizing the importance of understanding the organization's mechanisms for promoting regional economic cooperation.

3. IMEC is a solely Indian-led initiative.                : Incorrect

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC's primary focus is on enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, not India and Africa.  The inclusion of Africa as a distractor tests the candidate's understanding of the corridor's geographic scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  A key goal of IMEC is to provide an alternative route, reducing dependence on traditional maritime routes like the Suez Canal.  This highlights the strategic importance of IMEC in diversifying trade routes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. IMEC is a multi-lateral initiative involving India, Middle Eastern countries, and European nations.  The assertion of sole Indian leadership is a misleading statement designed to test the candidate's awareness of the initiative's collaborative nature.

Therefore, only statement 2 is correct, making option (b) the correct answer. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the IMEC's goals and participants, emphasizing the importance of understanding the initiative's strategic significance and collaborative nature.  It tests accurate recall of the IMEC's geographic scope.


**10. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect. BIMSTEC's focus on trade involves various initiatives beyond the Disaster Management Exercise (DMEX), which is related to disaster preparedness.  The substitution of an initiative tests the candidate's understanding of BIMSTEC's trade-related activities.

Pair 2 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is primarily related to connectivity, although it has environmental implications.  However, it is not the primary initiative under the Environment and Climate Change focus area.  This mismatching of focus and initiative tests the candidate's understanding of BIMSTEC's approach to environmental issues.

Pair 3 is correct. The principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, political independence, and non-interference are indeed central to BIMSTEC's approach to security cooperation.  This highlights BIMSTEC's emphasis on peaceful coexistence and mutual respect among member states.

Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched, making option (c) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of BIMSTEC's focus areas and its initiatives, emphasizing the importance of understanding the organization's approach to different areas of cooperation.  It requires distinguishing between primary and secondary initiatives under each focus area.

**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization          Headquarters City
1. International Criminal Court (ICC)     :    The Hague
2. New Development Bank (NDB)          :    Shanghai
3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Beijing
4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)        :    Bern

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Criminal Court (ICC) is indeed headquartered in The Hague, Netherlands.  The New Development Bank (NDB), established by the BRICS nations, has its headquarters in Shanghai, China. This is a crucial fact reflecting the growing economic influence of China and the BRICS group in global finance. However, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is headquartered in Beijing, not Shanghai, and the Universal Postal Union (UPU) is located in Bern, Switzerland.  Option (a) is incorrect because it only includes the ICC. Option (c) is wrong due to the incorrect headquarters location of AIIB. Option (d) is incorrect because while the ICC and NDB are correctly matched, the UPU headquarters is incorrectly stated. Therefore, only the ICC and NDB headquarters are correctly matched, making option (b) the correct answer.  The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise knowledge of international organizations' locations, often overlooked but crucial for understanding their geopolitical context and influence.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative      Key Feature
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) :    Focuses primarily on climate change mitigation
2.  International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) :   Connects India to Europe via Iran
3.  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)          :    Exclusively for ASEAN member states
4.  Geneva Conventions of 1949           :   Relates to maritime law

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) is correctly paired with its key feature of connecting India to Europe via Iran. This is a significant geopolitical and economic initiative aimed at diversifying trade routes and reducing reliance on traditional sea lanes. However, the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is far broader than just climate change mitigation; it encompasses supply chains, clean energy, and other economic issues. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) includes ASEAN member states and dialogue partners, making the statement about exclusivity incorrect.  Finally, the Geneva Conventions are primarily focused on international humanitarian law during armed conflict, not maritime law.  The incorrect pairings highlight the need for precise understanding of international agreements and their scope, a necessary skill for analyzing geopolitical strategies and economic interactions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Group                   Member Country
1.  Group of Seven (G7)                   :   Brazil
2.  Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) :    India
3.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO):    Sweden
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Belarus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Sweden's recent accession to NATO is a significant geopolitical development, reflecting shifts in European security dynamics. Belarus's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) represents the growing influence of this Eurasian security and economic bloc.  However, Brazil is not a member of the G7, and India is not a member of OPEC.  These incorrect pairings underscore the importance of accurate knowledge of international organizations' memberships, which are often dynamic and subject to change, reflecting shifting geopolitical alliances.  Understanding these memberships is crucial for analyzing global power dynamics and regional security arrangements.  The question tests the candidate's ability to identify accurate memberships within various international organizations, a key skill for understanding international relations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Agreement              Primary Goal
1.  BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement :    Promoting agricultural trade within BRICS
2.  BRICS Grain Exchange               :    Providing short-term liquidity support to member nations
3.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   Deepening economic ties between ASEAN and India
4.  India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA):   Establishing a customs union


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) accurately reflects its primary goal of reducing trade barriers and strengthening economic ties between ASEAN and India.  This is a crucial aspect of India's engagement with Southeast Asia and its broader economic strategy in the Indo-Pacific region.  However, the BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement is primarily focused on providing short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payment challenges, not promoting agricultural trade.  The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to facilitate agricultural trade, not provide liquidity.  Furthermore, the India-EFTA TEPA does not establish a customs union; EFTA members retain their own external tariffs.  The incorrect pairings highlight the need for precise understanding of the objectives of various international agreements and initiatives, a key element in analyzing international economic cooperation.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                          Significant Recent Development
1.  Iran                              :   Signed a 10-year agreement for Chabahar Port development with India
2.  Malaysia                           :   Hosted the 21st ASEAN-India Summit
3.  Kazakhstan                         :   Hosted the 24th SCO summit
4.  Italy                              :   Hosted the 50th G7 summit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Iran's agreement with India for the development of Chabahar Port is a significant development in regional connectivity and trade. Kazakhstan hosting the 24th SCO summit highlights its role in Eurasian affairs, and Italy hosting the 50th G7 summit underscores its position in global politics. However, Malaysia did *not* host the 21st ASEAN-India Summit; that was held in Laos.  The incorrect pairing of Malaysia highlights the importance of precise recall of recent events and locations in international affairs.  The question demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of recent geopolitical developments and the ability to accurately associate countries with specific events. This is crucial for understanding current global dynamics and their implications.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters
1. New Development Bank                       :   Brasília, Brazil
2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank       :   Beijing, China
3. International Criminal Court                 :   The Hague, Netherlands

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The New Development Bank (NDB), also known as the BRICS Development Bank, has its headquarters in Shanghai, China, not Brasília, Brazil.  Therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is indeed headquartered in Beijing, China, making statement 2 correct. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is correctly located in The Hague, Netherlands, making statement 3 correct. Thus, only options 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of the headquarters of significant international financial and judicial institutions.  Understanding the locations of these organizations is crucial for comprehending their global influence and operations within the international economic and legal frameworks.  Distractor 1 uses a plausible but incorrect location, highlighting the need for precise knowledge rather than relying on assumptions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization              Key Initiative/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency     :   Atoms4NetZero
2. International Telecommunication Union :   Global Cybersecurity Index
3.  BRICS                                  :   Contingent Reserve Arrangement

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has a key initiative called Atoms4NetZero, aimed at promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) publishes the Global Cybersecurity Index annually to assess cybersecurity commitments of nations.  The BRICS group has a Contingent Reserve Arrangement to provide short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payment issues.  All three pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the activities and roles of these international organizations.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to link organizations with their specific programs, showcasing knowledge of international cooperation in diverse fields like nuclear energy, cybersecurity, and economic stability.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Group/Organization                      Member Country
1. G4 Nations                             :   Canada
2. Uniting for Consensus (UfC)           :   Pakistan
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Belarus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) are a group advocating for UN Security Council reform. Canada is not a member of this group, making statement 1 incorrect.  Pakistan is a member of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, which opposes the G4's bid for permanent UNSC seats, making statement 2 correct.  Belarus recently joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), making statement 3 correct. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of international groupings and their memberships, requiring precise understanding of the composition of various diplomatic alliances.  The inclusion of Canada as a potential G4 member is a plausible but incorrect distractor.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Agreement/Initiative              Participating Country
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)    :   Fiji
2.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   Thailand
3. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   United States


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Fiji is a member of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF).  Thailand is a member of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a key participant in the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA). The United States is a participant in the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC).  All three pairs are correctly matched, demonstrating knowledge of significant economic agreements and initiatives involving India and its regional and global partners. The question tests the ability to recall countries involved in these initiatives, highlighting the significance of understanding international economic cooperation.  The breadth of the question requires a wide range of knowledge about different trade partnerships.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                    Description/Feature
1.  Quad Cancer Moonshot                     :   Focuses on sustainable port infrastructure
2.  BRICS Grain Exchange                     :   Aims to create a fair trading system for agricultural products
3.  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :   Targets clean energy projects in Africa


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Quad Cancer Moonshot is a health initiative, not related to port infrastructure; therefore, statement 1 is incorrect. The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to create a fair trading system for agricultural products within the BRICS community, making statement 2 correct. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a broader initiative, but it does include a focus on clean energy projects in Africa among other areas, making statement 3 incorrect in its specificity.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched. This question tests the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives and accurately associate them with their specific goals and areas of focus.  The distractors play on the interconnectedness of global initiatives to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative          Key Feature/Characteristic
1. IPEF’s Supply Chain Council                 :   Focuses on strengthening critical supply chains in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Aims to enhance global connectivity.
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)      :   Belarus recently joined as its tenth member.
4. G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :   Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects in developing nations.
5.  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)                :   Established in 1994, India joined in 1996.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Council explicitly focuses on strengthening critical supply chains within the Indo-Pacific region. The IMEC's stated goal is to improve global connectivity. The SCO's recent addition of Belarus as its tenth member is a significant development. The G7's PGII initiative clearly aims to mobilize substantial funds for infrastructure projects in developing countries by 2027. Finally, the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was indeed established in 1994, with India joining in 1996.  These facts are all verifiable through official sources and reports related to each respective organization or initiative.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    Economic Initiative/Organization              Specific Characteristic/Outcome
1.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN.
2.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework               :   Operates on a principle of majority voting.
3. BRICS New Development Bank (NDB)            :   Headquarters in Beijing, China.
4.  India-GCC Relations                          :   India has a trade surplus with GCC countries.
5.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)             :   India joined in 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) is indeed headquartered in Shanghai, China.  Let's examine why the other pairs are incorrect: Pair 1 is false; India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus. Pair 2 is incorrect; SAARC operates on the principle of unanimity, not majority voting. Pair 4 is also false; India has a trade deficit with GCC countries, not a surplus. Pair 5 is false; India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2023.  Therefore, only option (c) accurately reflects the correct matching. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the presence of at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement         Specific Action/Policy
1.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  :   Launched the Atoms4Climate initiative.
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) :   Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
3.  Geneva Conventions of 1949                :   Established the International Criminal Court (ICC).
4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)               :   Celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2024.
5.  OPEC+                                     :   Agreed to extend deep oil output cuts into 2025.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 4, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 4, and 5 are correctly matched. The ITU did release the GCI 2024. The UPU celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2024. OPEC+ did agree to extend oil output cuts.  However, the other pairs are incorrect. The IAEA has an Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero initiative, not Atoms4Climate. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are foundational to international humanitarian law but did not establish the ICC (that was the Rome Statute). Therefore, only option (a) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                          Characteristic/Action

4.  NATO                                          :   Sweden is its 31st member.
5.  UfC (Uniting for Consensus)                     :   Opposes G4 nations' bid for permanent UNSC seats.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 5 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to create a fair trading system for agricultural products. The UfC indeed opposes the G4's bid for permanent UNSC seats. The other pairings are incorrect: The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund was established in 2009, not 2017. SIPRI's 2023 report ranked India fourth, not third, in military spending.  NATO's membership count includes Sweden as its 32nd member, not 31st. Therefore, only option (a) accurately identifies the correctly matched pairs. Options (b), (c), and (d) include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization              Key Programme/Initiative

3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)      : Operation Crimson Barracuda (drug seizure operation)
4.  BIMSTEC                               : BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program explicitly focuses on using nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions goals.

2. Bhutan                                    : Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Project
3. Singapore                                : Project Nexus (cross-border payments)
4. Vietnam                                  : Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (established in 2024)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate and verifiable information about India's bilateral relations. The Maldives saw the launch of the RuPay card as part of enhanced economic cooperation.  Bhutan's collaboration with India includes the Mangdechhu Hydroelectric Project, a significant joint venture. Singapore and India's partnership is strengthened through Project Nexus, focusing on improving cross-border payment systems.  Finally, India and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024.  The options are constructed to ensure that a thorough understanding of the specific initiatives is required to answer correctly, avoiding easy guessing.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention             Key Provision/Objective
1. Geneva Conventions of 1949              : Protection of cultural property during armed conflict
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)      : Elimination of chemical weapons and prevention of future use
3. Geneva Protocol 1925                    : Prohibits use of chemical and biological weapons in conflict
4.  Outer Space Treaty (1967)               : Banning weapons of mass destruction in orbit or on celestial bodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) aims to eliminate chemical weapons. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty seeks to prevent the placement of weapons of mass destruction in space. However, the Geneva Conventions of 1949 do *not* primarily focus on the protection of cultural property; that is covered by separate treaties like the 1954 Hague Convention.  The options are designed to test precise knowledge of international law and treaties, making superficial understanding insufficient for a correct answer.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Conflict Area/Region                     Key Characteristic/Issue
1. Gulf of Aden                            :  Suicide bombing and gun attack
2. Somalia                                 :  Pirate attacks
3. Southern Thailand (Patani Conflict)    :  Ethnic and religious tensions, autonomy demands
4. West Papua (Indonesia)                  : Independence movement, resource exploitation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Southern Thailand's Patani conflict is indeed characterized by ethnic and religious tensions and demands for greater autonomy.  West Papua's conflict involves an independence movement, resource exploitation, and cultural suppression.  However, the Gulf of Aden is known for pirate attacks, not suicide bombings (which are more associated with Somalia). Similarly, while Somalia has experienced many internal conflicts, the description of a suicide bombing and gun attack is a specific event not representative of the entire region's ongoing issues. The complexity of the options requires specific knowledge of each conflict area to answer accurately.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation/Exercise              Description/Objective
1. Operation Vijay                         : Blockade of Pakistan’s navy in the Arabian Sea
2. Operation Safed Sagar                   : Targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions
3. Operation Talwar                        : Eviction of Pakistani soldiers and militants from Kargil
4. Exercise Agni Warrior                    : Joint military training between India and Singapore

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Operations Safed Sagar (Indian Air Force targeting Pakistani troops) and Talwar (Indian Army's Kargil operation) are accurately described. However, Operation Vijay was the overall Indian Army operation to evict Pakistani forces from Kargil, not a naval blockade (that was Operation Talwar). Exercise Agni Warrior is a bilateral exercise between India and Singapore, not part of Operation Vijay. The options are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of specific military operations and their objectives, requiring in-depth factual recall.





**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation             Region/Objective
1. Operation Safed Sagar         :   Blockade of Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea
2. Operation Talwar             :   Targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions in Kargil
3. Operation Southern Readiness :   Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) to Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Operation Safed Sagar was an Indian Air Force operation targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions during the Kargil War. Operation Talwar was an Indian Navy operation to blockade Pakistan's navy in the Arabian Sea. Operation Southern Readiness is a multinational maritime exercise focused on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, not a specific operation limited to Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched.  The other options incorrectly link operations to their incorrect objectives or regions. Option (a) incorrectly assigns Operation Safed Sagar to a naval blockade. Option (c) incorrectly links Operation Southern Readiness to humanitarian efforts in a specific geographical location. Option (d) combines an incorrect pairing (Operation Safed Sagar) with a partially correct one (Operation Southern Readiness, which is a recurring exercise, not a one-time operation focused solely on Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam).


**2. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following pairs:**

   Concept                        Description
1. Weaponization of space        :   Use of space to support ground, sea, and air-based military operations
2. Militarization of space       :   Deployment of weapons in space, enabling conflict by targeting objects in orbit or on Earth
3. 1967 Outer Space Treaty      :   Permits the deployment of WMDs in orbit or on celestial bodies

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Weaponization of space refers to the deployment of weapons in space, enabling conflict by targeting objects in orbit or on Earth. Militarization of space involves using space to support ground, sea, and air-based military operations without necessarily deploying weapons in space itself. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on the Moon, or on other celestial bodies. Therefore, only the second pair is correctly matched. Option (a) incorrectly defines weaponization of space. Option (c) incorrectly combines a correct definition (militarization) with an incorrect one (weaponization). Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched.

3. BRICS                             :   BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) focuses on nuclear energy, safety, and non-proliferation, not cybersecurity. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) deals with telecommunications standardization and development, not food security initiatives. The BRICS group has launched the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay as a payment system alternative to SWIFT.  Therefore, only the third pair is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) incorrectly link organizations to programs or initiatives outside their mandates.


**4. With reference to the TAPI gas pipeline project, consider the following pairs:**

   Feature                          Detail
1.  Gas Field Origin               :   Galkynysh gas field (previously called Ýolöten Gas Field)
2.  Pipeline Length                :   Approximately 1,800 km
3.  Southernmost Pipeline Location :   Mary, Turkmenistan

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 2024 Arab League Summit was indeed held in Bahrain. The Summit on Peace in Ukraine took place in Switzerland.  However, the 19th East Asia Summit (EAS) was held in Jakarta, Indonesia, not Vientiane, Lao PDR.  Therefore, only the first two pairs are correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) incorrectly include the mismatched EAS location.


**6. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is correctly matched with its location in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  This is a well-established geographical fact. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not South Africa.  The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not India, Bhutan, and Nepal. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans like the Panama Canal. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. The other options include incorrect pairings, acting as effective distractors for a candidate who might have superficial knowledge of the locations.  The question tests factual recall and geographical knowledge, essential skills for UPSC aspirants.

1. Gulf of Aden                  : Connects the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea
2. Abu Musa Island                : Held by UAE since 1971
3. Senkaku Islands               : Located in the South China Sea, approximately 410 km west of Taiwan
4. Southern Thailand (Patani Conflict) : Conflict between Thai government and Malay-Buddhist separatists


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf of Aden connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, not the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.  Abu Musa Island is held by Iran, not the UAE, since 1971. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are located in the East China Sea, approximately 410 km west of Okinawa Island, not Taiwan, and the Patani conflict involves Malay-Muslim separatists, not Malay-Buddhist separatists. All the statements provided are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer. This question assesses factual recall regarding geopolitical locations and conflicts, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in international relations for UPSC preparation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                                 Capital City
1. Somalia                               : Addis Ababa
2.  Rwanda                               :  Nairobi
3.  Mauritius                             : Port Louis
4. Togo                                  : Accra


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The capital of Somalia is Mogadishu, not Addis Ababa (which is Ethiopia's capital).  Nairobi is the capital of Kenya, not Rwanda (Kigali is Rwanda's capital). Accra is the capital of Ghana, not Togo (Lomé is Togo's capital). Only Mauritius is correctly paired with its capital, Port Louis. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of capital cities in Africa, a commonly tested area in the UPSC exam.  The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of geographical details.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Energy Project/Initiative            Location/Countries Involved
1. TAPI Pipeline                      : Transports natural gas from Turkmenistan to India, bypassing Pakistan
2. India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline:  Connects India and Sri Lanka
3. Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline     : Connects India and Bhutan
4. Arun-3 Hydro Electric Project      : Located in Nepal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TAPI pipeline does transport natural gas, but its route includes Afghanistan and Pakistan. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline connects India and Bangladesh, not India and Sri Lanka.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline connects India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan. Only the Arun-3 Hydroelectric Project is correctly located in Nepal.  This question tests knowledge of energy projects and cross-border infrastructure initiatives, crucial for understanding India's regional relationships.  The incorrect options create plausible but ultimately wrong associations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                         Key Feature/Relationship with India
1. Bhutan                          :  Shares border with five Indian states
2. Maldives                        :  Largest infrastructure project is being developed by China
3. Australia                       :  Identified India as a ‘second-tier’ security partner in its 2024 National Defence Strategy
4. Japan                           :  Signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bhutan shares borders with four Indian states, not five.  The Greater Male Connectivity Project in the Maldives is being developed by India, not China. Australia identified India as a ‘top-tier’ security partner, not ‘second-tier’.  Only Japan's CEPA with India is correctly stated as signed before 2022. This question tests knowledge about India's relationships with other countries, focusing on specific details.  The incorrect options provide plausible but false information, demanding precise knowledge from the candidate.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of international relations.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Location/Feature           Description/Significance
1. Nagorno-Karabakh Region             : Officially recognized as part of Armenia
2. Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island)       : Located in the Baltic Sea
3. Nord Stream Pipelines                : Supply natural gas from Russia to southern Germany
4. Kursk Region                         : Borders Belarus


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) None
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized as part of Azerbaijan, not Armenia. Snake Island is located in the Black Sea, not the Baltic Sea.  The Nord Stream pipelines supply natural gas to northern Germany, not southern Germany. The Kursk region borders Ukraine, not Belarus.  Therefore, none of the pairs are correctly matched. This question tests knowledge of geopolitical locations and events, highlighting the importance of precision in understanding international conflicts and energy infrastructure.  The incorrect options offer plausible but false information, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between similar but distinct geographical entities.


**1. With reference to international initiatives for infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                       Key Feature
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure in developing nations.
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative       : Led by the G20, focuses on renewable energy projects in Africa.
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Primarily concerned with sustainable agriculture and food security.
4. G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition                  : Aims to cap the price of Russian oil exports.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022 by the G7, aims to mobilize private investment to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries.  Its target is to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, prioritizing sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development.  This makes pair 1 correct.

The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition is a mechanism designed to limit the price of Russian oil exports. This is intended to reduce Russia's revenue from oil sales, thereby impacting its ability to fund its military operations. This makes pair 4 correct.

The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is indeed a G7-led effort, but it focuses on facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa, not renewable energy broadly.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is not primarily concerned with sustainable agriculture; its focus is on ocean conservation and sustainable maritime practices.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are incorrect. The inclusion of these incorrect pairs serves as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise understanding of each initiative's focus.


**2. With reference to India's engagement with international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                  India's Role/Contribution
1. Commonwealth                               : Fourth largest financial contributor.
2. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)         :  First Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) adopted in 2020.
3. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) : Jagjit Pavadia served a two-term tenure (2015-2024).
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Requested assistance for low-income countries to access financial resources.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India is the largest member of the Commonwealth, representing nearly 60% of its total population and is the fourth-largest contributor financially.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

India's first Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF was adopted in 2010, not 2020, making pair 2 incorrect.  While Jagjit Pavadia was re-elected to the INCB for a third term starting in 2025, suggesting prior service, the statement in pair 3 about a completed two-term tenure from 2015-2024 is inaccurate.  The Union Finance Minister did request the AIIB to assist low-income countries in accessing financial resources, making pair 4 correct.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect information in pairs 2 and 3 makes this a challenging question, requiring precise knowledge.


**3. With reference to Combating Transnational Organized Crime, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative/Convention                                Key Feature
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) : Supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003.
2. South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN) : Established in 2001 and India is a member.
3. Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) : India is a member of its steering committee.
4. UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund             : Primarily supports programs on Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Countering Terrorist Travel Programme (CTTP)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, was indeed supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption in 2003.  This makes pair 1 correct.  SAWEN was established in 2011, not 2001, making pair 2 incorrect. India's membership in the steering committee of the GlobE network is accurate, making pair 3 correct.  The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund does indeed support the CFT and CTTP programs, making pair 4 correct.  The incorrect information in pair 2 serves as a strong distractor, requiring precise factual recall.


**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations and regional initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

Country/Initiative                             Key Feature
1. India-Bangladesh relations                 : Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2. BIMSTEC                                    : Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024.
3. India-Singapore relations                  :  Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN.
4. India-Vietnam relations                    :  Elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2023.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh is indeed India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, making pair 1 correct.  The BIMSTEC Charter did come into force in May 2024, giving BIMSTEC a legal personality, making pair 2 correct.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner within ASEAN, making pair 3 correct. However, the India-Vietnam Strategic Partnership was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024, not 2023, making pair 4 incorrect.  The inclusion of a nearly correct but ultimately false statement in pair 4 increases the question's difficulty.  The candidate needs to possess precise information to answer correctly.


**5. With reference to International Organizations and their activities, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                     Activity/Report
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  : Released a report on illicit nuclear trafficking incidents in 2023.
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) : Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2023.
3.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)               : Celebrated its 140th anniversary in 2024.
4. OPEC+                                         : Agreed to extend its deep oil output cuts into 2025.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) did report on nuclear material theft incidents in 2023, making pair 1 correct. The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) in 2024,  making pair 2 incorrect, because the year is wrong. The UPU celebrated its 150th anniversary, not its 140th, making pair 3 incorrect. OPEC+ did agree to extend its oil output cuts into 2025, making pair 4 correct. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect years in pairs 2 and 3, and a slight alteration in pair 3,  serves as strong distractors, demanding precise factual recall to answer correctly.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative        Key Feature/Activity
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       :   Combats money laundering and terrorist financing
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Monitors the implementation of drug control treaties
3.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  Produces the World Drug Day Report
4.  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE)  :  Focuses on cybercrime investigations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

The FATF's primary function is to develop and promote policies to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  Its Mutual Evaluation Reports assess countries' adherence to these standards.  The INCB's core mandate is to monitor the implementation of international drug control treaties and conventions, ensuring states comply with their obligations. The UNODC, as a specialized agency of the UN, compiles and publishes various reports, including the annual World Drug Day Report, providing data and analysis on global drug trends.  GlobE's focus is on international cooperation in anti-corruption law enforcement, not specifically cybercrime investigations, although cybercrime is a facet of corruption. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairings of 2 and 3. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair 4. Option (d) is incomplete, omitting the correctly matched pair 2.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative                 Significant Activity/Characteristic
1.  SAARC                                         :   Currently largely dysfunctional
2.  BIMSTEC                                      :   Acquired legal personality with the entry into force of its charter
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)     :   Recently admitted Belarus as its 10th member
4.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) :  Includes the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. SAARC's effectiveness has been significantly hampered in recent years, leading to its largely dysfunctional state. BIMSTEC's legal personality solidified with the entry into force of its charter, marking a significant step in its institutional development. The SCO expanded its membership by admitting Belarus, increasing its geopolitical influence.  ASEAN's institutional framework includes the ARF, a key platform for regional security dialogue and cooperation. Therefore, all four pairs represent accurate pairings of regional organizations and their corresponding activities or characteristics.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are all incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                  Subject Matter
1.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Combats illicit trafficking of nuclear materials
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)             :   Prohibits the development and use of chemical weapons
3.  Biological Weapons Convention                  :   Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons
4.  Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC) :  Addresses crimes against humanity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) and the Biological Weapons Convention explicitly prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, and use of their respective weapons. The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC), with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  However, the UNTOC, while addressing transnational organized crime, does not specifically focus on illicit nuclear material trafficking; that falls under the purview of other international agreements and organizations like the IAEA.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                              Focus/Objective
1.  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :  Combats cervical cancer
2.  “Energy for Growth in Africa” initiative           :   Facilitates clean energy investment in Africa
3.  Quad Cancer Moonshot partnership                :   Combats cervical cancer
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)       :   Assists low-income countries in accessing financial resources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are accurately matched. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative aims to attract investment for clean energy projects on the continent. The Quad Cancer Moonshot is a collaborative effort focused on combating cervical cancer. The AIIB's mandate includes assisting developing nations, particularly low-income countries, in accessing financial resources for infrastructure and development projects.  However, the PGII's focus is on funding infrastructure projects globally, not on healthcare initiatives like combating cervical cancer.  Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 1 or omit correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Indian Act/Legislation                           Purpose/Feature
1.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Deals with terrorism and related offenses
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000          :   India's implementing legislation for the CWC
4.  Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 :  Empowers Commanders of Inter-Services Organizations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d) All four

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The PMLA, 2002, forms the legal framework for combating money laundering in India and established the FIU-IND.  The UAPA, 1967, deals with unlawful activities, including terrorism. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is India's domestic law implementing the international Chemical Weapons Convention. The Inter-services Organisations Act, 2023, grants specific command, control, and disciplinary powers to commanders of inter-services organizations.  Therefore, all four pairs correctly link Indian legislation with their respective purposes or features. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underestimate the number of correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative         Key Feature/Initiative
1.  INCB (International Narcotics Control Board) :  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election for a third term (2025-2030)
2.  UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime):  Secretariat for UNTOC (UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime)
3.  GLOBE Network (Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities): India's election to its steering committee
4.  FATF (Financial Action Task Force): Adoption of India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The INCB, indeed, re-elected Jagjit Pavadia for a third term. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for the UNTOC, a crucial international treaty against transnational organized crime. India's election to the steering committee of the GLOBE Network signifies its commitment to global anti-corruption efforts. Finally, the FATF's adoption of India's MER demonstrates the international assessment of India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings. Each pair accurately reflects a specific and verifiable fact related to the respective international organization or initiative.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                      Drug-Related Issue
1. Canada                               :  Legalization of Cannabis
2. Afghanistan                           :  Part of the "Death Crescent" region (high drug production)
3.  Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay): High prevalence of cocaine trafficking
4.  United States (27 Jurisdictions)   :  Legalization of Cannabis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Canada and 27 US jurisdictions have legalized cannabis, reflecting a shift in drug policy in some parts of the world. Afghanistan is a key part of the "Death Crescent," a region notorious for opium and heroin production. The Triple Frontier Area, due to its porous borders and weak governance, is a significant hub for cocaine trafficking. Therefore, option (d) encompasses all accurate pairings. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect, as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  The question assesses factual recall regarding global drug-related issues and their geographic distribution.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention       Key Aspect
1.  Palermo Convention (UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime): Ratified by India
2.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution: Focuses on human trafficking
3.  UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003: Supplements the Palermo Convention
4.  PIWTT (Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit):  Relates to India-Bangladesh trade and connectivity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of the respective international agreements and conventions. The Palermo Convention is indeed ratified by India. The SAARC Convention specifically targets the trafficking of women and children.  The UN Convention Against Corruption complements the Palermo Convention in addressing transnational organized crime.  Finally, the PIWTT is a crucial agreement facilitating trade and transit between India and Bangladesh. Option (d) correctly identifies all these accurate pairings. The other options are incomplete and therefore incorrect, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of these international instruments. This question tests factual knowledge and understanding of international legal frameworks related to crime and trade.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Location/Association
1.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF): Headquarters in London, UK
2.  India-UN Development Fund: Established a Commonwealth Sub-Window
3.  BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation):  Charter came into force in May 2024
4.  CHOGM (Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting):  Hosted in New Delhi in 1983


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate information. The CLGF's headquarters are in London. The India-UN Development Fund includes a Commonwealth Sub-Window. The BIMSTEC Charter did indeed come into force in May 2024. New Delhi hosted the CHOGM in 1983.  Therefore, option (c) accurately reflects all the correct pairings. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their activities, demanding specific factual recall.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                     Significant Bilateral Issue with India
1. Bangladesh:  Biggest trade partner of India in South Asia
2. China:  Largest trading partner of India in goods (2023)
3. Nepal:  Signing a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade with India and Bangladesh
4. Bhutan:  Hydropower projects like Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu in collaboration with India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (also known as the Palermo Convention), is a comprehensive treaty aimed at combating transnational organized crime, which includes money laundering.  Therefore, pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  However, the other pairs are mismatched. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993 focuses on the prohibition of chemical weapons, not biological weapons, as stated in pair 2. The Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, not chemical weapons (pair 3).

The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC), making pair 2 correct. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) aims to assist low-income countries in accessing financial resources, making pair 5 correct.  The other pairs are incorrect. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) focuses on supply chain resilience, not the establishment of the ICC (pair 1). The GLOBE Network combats corruption, not terrorism (pair 3). The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund supports counter-terrorism efforts, not clean energy projects in Africa (pair 4). This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international initiatives and their specific goals, requiring detailed understanding of their mandates and operations. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives and their objectives.  The question demands a high level of factual recall and analytical skill.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region/Area                                    Characteristic Feature
1. Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle)           :   Largest source of FDI into India in 2023-2024
2. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :  Most abused drugs: Cannabis, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
3. Singapore                                     :   Highest tea production in India
4. Assam                                          :   Largest trade partner of India in ASEAN
5. India                                          :   Fourth largest military spender in the world in 2023


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. The Triple Frontier Area is known for its high rates of drug abuse, and the World Military Expenditure report shows India as the fourth largest military spender in 2023. The other pairs are incorrect. The Golden Triangle is associated with drug production, not FDI (pair 1). Singapore is India's largest trade partner in ASEAN, not Assam (pair 3 and 4). Assam is a major tea-producing region in India, but it doesn’t represent the highest production in India (pair 3).  This question tests factual knowledge about geographical areas, economic indicators, and global rankings. The distractors are designed to mislead candidates who possess only superficial knowledge, requiring detailed understanding to differentiate between correct and incorrect pairings.  The question demands precise recall of facts and figures.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Capital City
1. Bhutan                      Paro
2. Bangladesh                 Dhaka
3. Maldives                    Malé
4. China                       Beijing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only Bangladesh's capital is Dhaka and Maldives' capital is Malé.  Option (a) is incorrect because Paro is not the capital of Bhutan; Thimphu is. Option (c) is incorrect because Beijing is indeed the capital of China, but the capital of Maldives is not mentioned correctly in option (a). Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched capital of Bhutan.  This question tests factual recall of capital cities, a common element in UPSC examinations. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect capital cities serves as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge for a correct answer.  The question also subtly tests the candidate's ability to identify and eliminate incorrect information efficiently.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                       Country
1. Amo Chu                     Nepal
2. Manas River                 India
3. Jamuna River                Bangladesh
4. Omo River                   Kenya


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a). The Manas River flows into Assam, India, and the Jamuna River (a part of the Brahmaputra) is in Bangladesh. Option (b) is incorrect because the Amo Chu flows into West Bengal, India, and the Omo River is in Ethiopia. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched Amo Chu and Omo River. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched Amo Chu and Omo River. This question assesses factual recall of rivers and their locations, a common theme in geography-related UPSC questions.  The inclusion of rivers from the same region but different countries acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Hydropower Project          Country
1. Kurichu                      Nepal
2. Tala                         Bhutan
3. Chukha                       Bhutan
4. Mangdechhu                  Bhutan


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu are hydropower projects located in Bhutan.  Option (b) is incorrect as Kurichu is a Bhutanese project, not a Nepali one. Option (c) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched Kurichu project. Option (d) is incorrect because it erroneously includes Kurichu as a Nepali project.  The question tests knowledge of specific hydropower projects and their locations, requiring detailed understanding of India's relations with its neighboring countries. The use of similar-sounding names and the inclusion of a plausible but incorrect pairing enhances the question's difficulty and assesses the candidate's ability to discriminate between correct and incorrect information.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                     Major Trading Partner (Goods)
1. India                        China
2. Bangladesh                 India
3. Maldives                    India
4. UK                           India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). China is India's largest trading partner in goods, and India is Bangladesh's second largest trading partner in Asia. Option (b) is incorrect because although India is a significant trading partner for Maldives, it isn't explicitly stated as the *major* trading partner. Option (c) is incorrect as it includes the questionable pairing of India and the UK; while they trade, the UK is not listed as a major trading partner for India in the given context.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccuracies discussed above. This question assesses the understanding of major trading relationships between countries.  The use of qualifiers like "major" and "largest" and the inclusion of plausible but slightly incorrect pairings make the question challenging, requiring a nuanced understanding of the data.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                 Focus Area
1. UNOCT                        Countering Financing of Terrorism
2. FATF                          Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction
3. SIPRI                         Multilateral Peace Operations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  UNOCT (United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism) focuses on Countering Financing of Terrorism. FATF (Financial Action Task Force) assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. SIPRI (Stockholm International Peace Research Institute) publishes reports on military expenditure and multilateral peace operations.  All three pairs are correctly matched.  Therefore, option (a), (c) and (d) are incorrect as they don't include all the correctly matched pairs. The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their areas of expertise. The inclusion of well-known international organizations with related but slightly different mandates makes the question challenging, requiring precise knowledge of each organization's specific focus.  This tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar concepts.


**1. With reference to International Organizations and Agreements, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agreement                     Specific Feature
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       :   Established the International Criminal Court
2. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing
3. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)  :   Aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Includes Australia as a member state.
5.  Group of Seven (G7)                    :   Launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because pairs 2, 3, and 5 accurately reflect the features of the respective organizations and agreements.  The FATF's primary focus is on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, not establishing the International Criminal Court (ICC), which is the function of the Rome Statute.  The UNTOC aims to combat transnational organized crime, which is correctly matched.  AITIGA's objective is to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India, accurately depicted.  The G7 launched the PGII initiative to fund infrastructure projects. The SCO does not include Australia as a member state; it's a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance.


**2. With reference to International Drug Control and Crime Prevention, consider the following pairs:**

   Entity/Initiative                                    Characteristic
1.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024
2.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)        :   Based in Singapore
3.  Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) :  India is a member of its steering committee
4.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ)  :  Launched the "Generation Justice" initiative
5.  Triple Frontier Area                              :   Includes countries of  Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. The UNODC released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, aligning with its mandate. India's membership in the GlobE steering committee is accurate. The CCPCJ did launch the Generation Justice initiative. The INCB is not based in Singapore and the Triple Frontier Area includes Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, not Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand (which is the Golden Triangle/Death Triangle).


**3. With reference to Regional Cooperation Mechanisms, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agreement                        Specific Detail
1. SAARC Currency Swap Framework               :   Operates on the principle of majority voting.
2. BIMSTEC Charter                             :   Came into force in May 2024 after ratification by all member states.
3.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)       :   India is the chair of its Supply Chain Council.
4.  ASEAN                                       :   Has 18 member countries including the US and Russia.
5.  Quad                                        :   Adopted the Wilmington Declaration at its summit in Wilmington, US.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 5 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 5 are correctly matched. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in May 2024, and the Quad did adopt the Wilmington Declaration.  SAARC decisions are made by unanimity, not majority voting. India is the *vice-chair*, not the chair, of IPEF's Supply Chain Council. ASEAN has 10 member states (the ASEAN countries), plus other partners in agreements like RCEP, but not a fixed 18 with US and Russia as members.


**4. With reference to India's Bilateral Relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                        Specific aspect of relationship
1. Bangladesh                                     :   India's smallest trade partner in South Asia.
2. Maldives                                      :   Signed a currency swap agreement with India.
3. Singapore                                     :   India's largest source of FDI in 2023-24.
4. Vietnam                                       :   Elevated its strategic partnership with India to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024.
5. Nepal                                          :   Signed a pact with India and Bangladesh to facilitate cross-border electricity trade.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Maldives and India have a currency swap agreement. Singapore was India's largest source of FDI. India and Vietnam elevated their partnership.  Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have a pact for cross-border electricity trade.  Bangladesh is India's *largest*, not smallest, trade partner in South Asia.


**5. With reference to India's participation in various international initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                       Specific Detail
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)            :   India is not a signatory to the convention.
2.  International Solar Alliance (ISA)            :   Singapore is not a member of the alliance.
3.  Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI)         :   Bangladesh has joined the initiative.
4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)                 :   Celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2024.
5.  "Project Nexus"                               :   Aims to connect India's UPI with FPSs of other countries including Singapore.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 3, 4, and 5 are correctly matched.  Bangladesh joined IPOI.  The UPU celebrated its 150th anniversary. Project Nexus links India's UPI with other countries' FPSs, including Singapore's.  India *is* a signatory to the CWC. Singapore *is* a member of the ISA.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region Associated with Drug Abuse           Primary Drug of Abuse
1. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) : Opioids
2. Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)     : Cocaine
3. Death Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)   : Cannabis

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the pairing of the Golden Triangle with Cocaine is accurate.  The Golden Triangle, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is historically and presently a major producer of opium, which is processed into heroin, a type of opioid.  While other drugs may be present, opioids, particularly heroin, are the dominant illicit drug associated with this region.

Option (a) is incorrect. The Triple Frontier Area, a region where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is known for drug trafficking involving various substances, but opioids are not the primary drug associated with this zone. Cocaine and marijuana are more commonly trafficked there.

Option (c) is incorrect. The Death Crescent, encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, is indeed a major producer and trafficking hub for opium and heroin (opioids).  Cannabis is also cultivated and trafficked in the region, but it is not the primary drug associated with the Death Crescent.  The region's primary notoriety stems from its opioid production.

Option (d) is incorrect because, as explained above, only the pairing in option (b) is correct.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical regions notorious for drug production and the primary drugs associated with each.  It highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of global drug trafficking networks.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                        Key Initiative/Focus
1. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) : Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)       :  Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
3. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) : Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a) because only the pairing of UNTOC with the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is accurate. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is a crucial international legal instrument aimed at combating various forms of organized crime. The Global Firearms Programme (GFP), run by the UNODC,  is a key initiative under UNTOC's umbrella focused on reducing the illicit flow of firearms.

Option (b) is incorrect. While the UNODC is deeply involved in crime prevention and justice, the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative is primarily associated with the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ).

Option (c) is incorrect. The Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) is a key UNODC initiative, not directly linked to the CCPCJ. Although the CCPCJ addresses TOC, TOCTA is a specific UNODC project for assessing threats.

Option (d) is incorrect because only option (a) is a correct pairing.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of international organizations' roles in combating transnational organized crime, emphasizing the specific initiatives and their association with the respective organizations. It tests knowledge of the UN system’s structure and operational mechanisms in global security.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement            Country/Region of Significance
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)              : Singapore
2.  Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP): India
3.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)                 :  Belarus

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the FATF plenary meeting mentioned in the text was held in Singapore and India was a founding member of RCEP before withdrawing.

Option (a) is partially correct but incomplete. While Singapore hosted the FATF plenary, the question asks about the significance of the country/region to the organization, which applies to both Singapore and India.

Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. While India was involved with RCEP, the question demands a complete answer.

Option (d) is incorrect. Belarus is not significantly associated with the GCC.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical and political significance of various international organizations and agreements.  It requires understanding of the different roles that countries play within these global frameworks.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Treaty/Convention                                   Specific Focus
1. Geneva Conventions of 1949                     : Protection of Cultural Property
2. Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property :  Protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts
3. Protocol II (1977)                               :   Humane treatment of prisoners of war

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because the Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property specifically addresses the protection of cultural heritage during armed conflicts.

Option (a) is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 primarily focus on the protection of victims of war (wounded soldiers, prisoners of war, and civilians).  Protection of cultural property is covered under a separate convention.

Option (c) is incorrect. Protocol II (1977) of the Geneva Conventions deals with the protection of victims of non-international armed conflicts (civil wars).  Humane treatment of prisoners of war is a key aspect of the original Geneva Conventions of 1949 (GC III).

Option (d) is incorrect because one pair is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international humanitarian law and the specific focus of various treaties and conventions.  It highlights the need for precise understanding of international legal instruments and their specific mandates.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative              Specific Objective/Action
1.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)     : Combatting Transnational Organized Crime
2.  India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting           :  Adopting a Joint Action Plan 2024-2028
3.  Strengthening the Quad Act                     : Combating Cervical Cancer

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting resulted in the adoption of a Joint Action Plan, and the Strengthening the Quad Act includes initiatives to combat cervical cancer.

Option (a) is incorrect.  The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) focuses on supporting women’s political representation and social resilience, not combating transnational organized crime.

Option (b) is partially correct, but incomplete. The GCC meeting is correctly paired with its outcome, but option (c) offers a more complete answer.

Option (d) is incorrect because only the pairs in option (c) are correctly matched. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their objectives, testing their ability to link specific actions to the relevant forums.  It demands understanding of multilateral diplomacy and international cooperation.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Convention                     Year of Adoption/Ratification
1. Biological Weapons Convention              :   1993
2. Chemical Weapons Convention                :   1972
3. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court :   1998
4. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime : 2000

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (1998) and the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (2000) are correctly matched with their respective years.  The Biological Weapons Convention was adopted in 1972, not 1993, and the Chemical Weapons Convention was adopted in 1993, not 1972.  These dates are crucial for understanding the historical evolution of international law concerning weapons of mass destruction and transnational organized crime. The other options incorrectly pair conventions with their years of adoption or ratification. Option (a) is incorrect as the Biological Weapons Convention was adopted in 1972. Option (b) is incorrect due to the incorrect year for the Biological Weapons Convention. Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched Rome Statute.  Understanding the timelines of these conventions is vital in comprehending the global efforts to regulate and control the proliferation of dangerous weapons and transnational criminal activities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Feature/Initiative
1. FATF                                          :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
2. UNODC                                        :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
3. GLOBE Network                               :   Combating Money Laundering
4.  INCB                                        :   Annual Report on World Drug Day

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a). The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' measures against money laundering and terrorist financing. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) does implement the Global Firearms Programme (GFP). Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute key features or initiatives to the organizations. The GLOBE network focuses on anti-corruption law enforcement, not money laundering, while the INCB (International Narcotics Control Board) does not release the Annual Report on World Drug Day; that report is published by the UNODC.  Understanding the roles and functions of these international organizations is crucial for analyzing global efforts in combating financial crime, drug trafficking, and corruption.  The accurate matching of organizations with their specific actions demonstrates a grasp of international cooperation in these areas.


**3. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following pairs:**

   Statement                                         Accuracy
1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East and Europe.      : Correct
2. IMEC's main objective is to facilitate infrastructure development projects in Africa.                : Incorrect
3. The IMEC initiative was primarily announced by the Ministry of Finance.                             : Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is designed to improve connectivity and trade among India, the Middle East, and Europe. Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect.  IMEC does not primarily focus on African infrastructure, and the initiative was announced by the Ministry of External Affairs, not the Ministry of Finance.  Understanding the geographical scope and the ministerial department responsible for the IMEC initiative is essential for comprehending India's foreign policy objectives and its economic engagement with the Eurasian region. The other options incorrectly link the IMEC initiative with inaccurate objectives or sponsoring ministries. This question tests the understanding of the specific aims and geographical focus of the IMEC, highlighting the importance of accurate information in analyzing international economic corridors.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                        Key Provision/Feature
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2.  Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967:   Primarily addresses terrorist financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000            :   India's adherence to the CWC
4. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023:  Grants disciplinary powers to ISO Commanders

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b). While the PMLA, 2002, does not directly establish the FIU-IND (it was established in 2004, though the PMLA laid the groundwork), the UAPA, 1967, is indeed concerned with unlawful activities, including aspects of terrorist financing. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, reflects India's commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The Inter-services Organisations Act, 2023, grants specified disciplinary and administrative powers to commanders of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs).  Option (a) is incorrect because of the inaccuracy regarding the PMLA and FIU-IND relationship. Options (c) and (d) include the false pairing of the PMLA and FIU-IND.  This question tests knowledge of Indian legal frameworks related to national security and international conventions, demonstrating an understanding of the legal instruments used to combat various forms of crime and threats.


**5. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following pairs:**

   Fact                                                     Accuracy
1. India is the largest member of the Commonwealth by population.     : Correct
2. The Commonwealth Games were last held in India in 2015.            : Incorrect
3. King Charles III is the Head of State of all Commonwealth countries.  : Incorrect

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). India is indeed the largest member state of the Commonwealth by population.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. The Commonwealth Games were last held in India in 2010, not 2015, and King Charles III is not the Head of State for all Commonwealth countries; many are republics.  This question assesses knowledge of the Commonwealth, testing awareness of its member states and the diversity of its political structures.  The other options incorrectly associate India with incorrect years for hosting Commonwealth Games and misrepresent the role of the British monarch within the Commonwealth.  This highlights the importance of precise factual knowledge in understanding international organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization              Key Feature/Recent Development
1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Primarily focuses on providing loans for infrastructure projects in African nations.
2. Arab League Summit 2024              :   Held in Morocco.
3. South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) :   Operates on a principle of majority voting for decision-making.
4. ASEAN + 3                              :   Includes Canada as a member.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **AIIB:** While AIIB does focus on infrastructure projects, its mandate extends beyond African nations to include a broader range of Asian countries.  The statement that it *primarily* focuses on African nations is incorrect.

2. **Arab League Summit 2024:** The 2024 Arab League Summit was held in Bahrain, not Morocco. This is a factual error in the pairing.

3. **SAARC:** SAARC operates on the principle of unanimity, not majority voting.  Decisions require consensus among all member states. This is a crucial difference that makes the pairing incorrect.

4. **ASEAN + 3:**  ASEAN + 3 comprises ASEAN member states plus China, Japan, and South Korea. Canada is not a member of this grouping.


**2. With reference to conflict-afflicted areas, consider the following pairs:**

   Conflict Zone                         Key Characteristic/Recent Event
1. Nagorno-Karabakh Region           :   Officially recognized as part of Armenia.
2. Ukraine                               :   Shares a land border with Belarus to the south.
3. Kursk Region                          :   Located in the western part of the Eastern European Plain.
4.  West Papua (Indonesia)               :   Conflict driven primarily by economic disparities.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  The provided information contains several inaccuracies:

1. **Nagorno-Karabakh:**  Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized as part of Azerbaijan, not Armenia, despite the long-standing conflict and Armenian claims.

2. **Ukraine:** Ukraine shares a land border with Belarus to the *north*, not the south.  Its southern border is primarily with the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.

3. **Kursk Region:** The Kursk Region is situated in the *central* part of the Eastern European Plain, bordering Ukraine.  The description in the pair is geographically incorrect.

4. **West Papua:** While resource exploitation is a factor in the West Papua conflict, the primary driver is an independence movement by the Free Papua Movement (OPM), reflecting ethnic and political grievances rather than solely economic disparities.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                 Geographical Feature/Neighbor
1. Mauritius                               :   Located west of Madagascar.
2. Rwanda                                  :   Borders Lake Victoria.
3. Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)     :   Borders the Mediterranean Sea.
4. Ghana                                   :   Shares a land border with Nigeria.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's examine each one:

1. **Mauritius:** Mauritius is located *east* of Madagascar, not west.

2. **Rwanda:** Rwanda borders Lake Kivu, not Lake Victoria. Lake Victoria is located further north in East Africa.

3. **DRC:** The DRC has access to the Atlantic Ocean, but it does not border the Mediterranean Sea.

4. **Ghana:** Ghana shares land borders with Burkina Faso, Togo, and Côte d'Ivoire, but not Nigeria. Nigeria is located further west on the Gulf of Guinea.


**4. With reference to international agreements and organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Organization                Key Characteristic/Recent Event
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN under this agreement.
2. SAARC Currency Swap Framework     :   Operates independently of the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement.
3. Colombo Process                       :   Currently chaired by Sri Lanka.
4.  Mercosur                             :    Recently admitted Argentina as a full member.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The statements are factually inaccurate:

1. **AITIGA:** India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with ASEAN under AITIGA.

2. **SAARC Currency Swap Framework:** While the SAARC framework operates separately, it's not entirely independent of other regional financial cooperation mechanisms like the BRICS Contingent Reserve Agreement.  There may be some interconnectedness in terms of broader financial policy considerations.  The statement of complete independence is an oversimplification.

3. **Colombo Process:**  The passage states that India chaired its first meeting *as Chair* of the Colombo Process.  This implies that India was the chair at that point in time;  the statement that Sri Lanka is currently the chair is not necessarily true.

4. **Mercosur:**  Bolivia recently became a full member of Mercosur, not Argentina, which was already a member.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Location                 Significant Feature/Recent Development
1. Gulf of Aden                         :   Known for its calm waters and minimal pirate activity.
2. Abu Musa Island                      :   Jointly administered by Iran and the UAE.
3. Senkaku Islands                      :   Located in the South China Sea.
4. Lake Turkana                         :   Located entirely within Kenya.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The information given in the pairs is incorrect:

1. **Gulf of Aden:** The Gulf of Aden is *not* known for calm waters and minimal pirate activity; it has historically been a region with significant pirate activity.

2. **Abu Musa Island:** Abu Musa Island is claimed by both Iran and the UAE, but it is *currently* held by Iran, not jointly administered.

3. **Senkaku Islands:** The Senkaku Islands are located in the East China Sea, not the South China Sea.

4. **Lake Turkana:** Lake Turkana is located in both northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia; it is not entirely within Kenya.


**6. With reference to places in news, consider the following pairs:**

   Place                                 Country/Region
1.  Lipulekh Pass                       :   Located at the tri-junction of India, Bhutan, and Nepal.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro                    :   Located in Kenya.
3.  Suez Canal                           :   Connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.
4.  Israel's Erez Crossing               :   Border crossing between Israel and Jordan.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The details provided are inaccurate:


1. **Lipulekh Pass:**  Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, *not* Bhutan.

2. **Mount Kilimanjaro:** Mount Kilimanjaro is located in *Tanzania*, not Kenya.

3. **Suez Canal:** The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, *not* the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

4. **Erez Crossing:** The Erez Crossing is a border crossing between Israel and the northern Gaza Strip, *not* Jordan.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                               Capital City
1. Somalia                                  Mogadishu
2. Uzbekistan                               Tashkent
3. Thailand                                 Bangkok
4. Lao PDR                                 Vientiane
5. Philippines                              Manila

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched. Mogadishu is the capital city of Somalia, Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, Vientiane is the capital of Lao PDR, and Manila is the capital of the Philippines.  These are well-established geographical facts and readily verifiable through standard reference sources. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair. A complete understanding of global geography is crucial for UPSC aspirants, and this question tests the recall of basic capital cities of significant countries. The inclusion of multiple countries from different regions (Africa, Central Asia, Southeast Asia) adds to the question's complexity and tests a broader range of geographical knowledge.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring the candidate to possess accurate knowledge rather than relying on guesswork.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Island Group                         Disputed Claimants
1. Abu Musa Island                             Iran and UAE
2. Senkaku Islands                             China and Japan
3. Snake Island                                Ukraine and Russia
4. Gotland Island                              Sweden and Russia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Abu Musa Island is indeed disputed between Iran and the UAE, and the Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are a point of contention between China and Japan.  These are long-standing territorial disputes with significant geopolitical implications.  However, Snake Island, while currently under Ukrainian control, is not a subject of a major ongoing territorial dispute with Russia in the same vein as the other two examples. The inclusion of Gotland, a Swedish island, as being disputed with Russia is entirely incorrect; there is no current territorial claim by Russia on Gotland.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of international relations and territorial disputes, requiring specific knowledge of the involved parties.  The inclusion of plausible but ultimately incorrect pairs acts as a strong distractor, highlighting the need for precise knowledge rather than general awareness of geopolitical tensions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Water Body                                  Connecting Seas/Oceans
1. Gulf of Aden                                Red Sea and Arabian Sea
2. Suez Canal                                 Mediterranean Sea and Red Sea
3. Strait of Hormuz                             Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman
4. Baltic Sea                                 North Atlantic Ocean and North Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf of Aden correctly connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. The Suez Canal links the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea. The Strait of Hormuz joins the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.  These are all established geographical facts. However, the Baltic Sea is connected to the North Atlantic Ocean, but the connection is via the Danish Straits and Kattegat, not directly to the North Sea.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of key waterways and their geographical significance. The inclusion of the Baltic Sea connection as a distractor highlights the importance of precise geographical knowledge, preventing candidates from relying on partial knowledge. The strategically important location of these waterways necessitates an in-depth understanding for UPSC aspirants.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lake                                       Location

2. Kariba Lake                               Zimbabwe and Zambia
3. Mansarovar Lake                            India and China (Tibet)
4. Sea of Galilee                             Israel and Syria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is indeed located in both Kenya and Ethiopia. Kariba Lake is situated on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia. Mansarovar Lake is found at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal.  The Sea of Galilee is located on the border between Israel and Syria.  All these geographical locations are well-documented.  This question tests the recall of specific geographical locations of significant lakes. The options are designed to challenge the candidate's precise knowledge, making it a difficult question that rewards accurate recall.  This type of question is frequently asked in the UPSC exam, testing the candidate's ability to recall specific details.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Mountain/Mountain Range                     Location
1. Mount Kilimanjaro                             Tanzania
2. Mount Aragats                               Armenia
3. Himalayas                                   India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, Pakistan
4.  Kailash Range                               Tibet (China)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania. Mount Aragats is in Armenia. The Himalayas span across India, Nepal, Bhutan, China, and Pakistan. The Kailash Range is in Tibet (China).  These are all accurate geographical locations.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of significant mountain ranges and peaks. The options are crafted to test precise knowledge, making it a challenging question.  The inclusion of geographically close but not identical locations serves as strong distractors.  The ability to accurately recall geographical locations is crucial for UPSC aspirants.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Location/Association
1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)   China
2. Arab League                                  Bahrain (Summit Location, 2024)
3. International Solar Alliance (ISA)             India (Headquarters)
4. Reporters Without Borders (RSF)             Paris


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The AIIB is headquartered in Beijing, China. The Arab League held its 2024 summit in Bahrain. The ISA has its headquarters in India. Reporters Without Borders (RSF) is based in Paris.  All four pairs are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their locations. The options are structured to test precise knowledge, requiring the candidate to correctly identify all four organizations and their affiliations.  The question emphasizes the importance of familiarity with global organizations for UPSC preparation.


**7. Consider the following pairs:**

   Conflict Zone                                    Primary Contending Parties
1. Nagorno-Karabakh Region                      Armenia and Azerbaijan
2. Southern Thailand (Patani Conflict)           Thai government and Malay-Muslim separatists
3. West Papua (Indonesia)                         Indonesian government and Free Papua Movement (OPM)
4. Kursk Region                                  Russia and Ukraine


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict is primarily between Armenia and Azerbaijan.  The Patani conflict in Southern Thailand involves the Thai government and Malay-Muslim separatists. The conflict in West Papua pits the Indonesian government against the Free Papua Movement (OPM).  However, the Kursk region is not primarily a conflict zone between Russia and Ukraine in the same way as the others listed; while there have been border skirmishes and tensions, it is not a major, sustained conflict area like the others. The question tests knowledge of ongoing conflicts and the primary actors involved. The careful selection of distractors ensures that only candidates with precise knowledge can answer correctly.  Understanding geopolitical conflicts is essential for UPSC aspirants.


**8. Consider the following pairs:**

   Pipeline/Project                          Route/Connection

2. Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline             India and Nepal
3. India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline      India and Bangladesh
4. Nord Stream Pipeline                      Russia and Germany


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The TAPI pipeline indeed connects Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline links India and Nepal. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline connects, as its name suggests, India and Bangladesh. The Nord Stream pipeline system also correctly connects Russia and Germany.  All four pairs represent correctly matched pipelines and their routes.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of major energy infrastructure projects and their geographical connections. The design ensures that only candidates with detailed knowledge of these projects can answer correctly.  Awareness of such projects is relevant to understanding international trade and energy security.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                                     Feature
1. Litani River                              :   Longest river in Lebanon
2. Pennaiyar River                         :   Largest east-flowing interstate river basin in India
3. Seine River                              :   Longest river in France
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Litani River is indeed the longest river in Lebanon, making pair 1 correct.  The Pennaiyar River is the *second* largest east-flowing interstate river basin in India, not the largest, thus making pair 2 incorrect. The Seine River is the second longest river in France; the Loire River holds the title of the longest, rendering pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  Understanding the superlative terms ("longest," "largest") is crucial for accurate matching. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar geographical features.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as the incorrect rankings of the Pennaiyar and Seine rivers, increases the question's difficulty and assesses the candidate's precise knowledge of geographical details.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Region                               Location
1. Saint Martin’s Island                     :   Bay of Bengal
2. Guam Island                             :   North Atlantic Ocean
3. Pamban Island                           :   Gulf of Mannar
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Saint Martin’s Island is correctly located in the Bay of Bengal (pair 1). Guam Island is situated in the North Pacific Ocean, not the North Atlantic Ocean (pair 2 is incorrect). Pamban Island is accurately placed in the Gulf of Mannar (pair 3). Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests factual knowledge of geographical locations and the ability to identify correct pairings from a list containing distractors. The incorrect placement of Guam Island serves as a strong distractor, highlighting the need for precise geographical knowledge. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar geographical areas.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Lake/Sea                                    Feature

2. Motihari-Amlekhgunj Pipeline            :   India-Nepal oil pipeline
3. TAPI Pipeline                            :   Transports natural gas
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, not the Mediterranean and Black Seas (pair 1 is incorrect). The Motihari-Amlekhgunj pipeline correctly connects India and Nepal for oil transportation (pair 2). The TAPI pipeline is accurately described as transporting natural gas (pair 3). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of infrastructure projects and their geographical locations and purposes. The incorrect description of the Suez Canal serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate’s ability to recall specific details. The question assesses factual recall and understanding of infrastructure projects.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is headquartered in Beijing, not Washington D.C. (pair 1 is incorrect). The Arab League's 2024 summit was indeed held in Bahrain (pair 2). The INSTC correctly connects India, Iran, and Russia (pair 3). Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their activities.  The incorrect location of the AIIB headquarters serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate’s ability to recall specific details.  The question assesses factual recall and understanding of international collaborations.



**1. With reference to International Organizations and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                          Key Feature/Initiative
1. BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :   Facilitates cross-border payments using SWIFT
2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)                   :   Focuses primarily on economic cooperation
3. BIMSTEC Charter                               :   Came into force before May 20, 2024
4.  Quad Cancer Moonshot                         :   Aims to eradicate all forms of cancer globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's analyze each pair:

1. **BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI):**  This initiative is designed as an alternative to SWIFT, not a system using SWIFT.  It uses blockchain technology to facilitate faster and more efficient cross-border transactions within the BRICS nations.  The statement incorrectly links it to SWIFT.

2. **ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF):** The ARF's primary focus is on political and security issues in the Southeast Asian region, not economic cooperation. While economic cooperation might be a tangential aspect, it's not the core mandate. ASEAN has other mechanisms dedicated to economic matters.

3. **BIMSTEC Charter:** The BIMSTEC Charter, a foundational document for the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation, came into force on May 20, 2024.  The statement incorrectly states it came into force before this date.

4. **Quad Cancer Moonshot:** This initiative focuses specifically on combating cervical cancer, not all forms of cancer.  The overly broad claim in the pair makes it incorrect.


The options are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of these organizations and their specific functions.  The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately inaccurate pairings, requiring careful consideration of the details of each initiative.


**2. With reference to International Organizations and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization/Initiative                          Key Feature/Initiative
1.  New Development Bank (NDB)                 :   Headquarters in Fortaleza, Brazil
2.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)       :   Exclusively focuses on climate change mitigation
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)      :   Belarus joined before 2024
4.  G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative :   Led by the United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The options are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of these organizations and their specific functions.  The incorrect options include plausible but ultimately inaccurate pairings, requiring careful consideration of the details of each initiative.

1. **New Development Bank (NDB):** The NDB's headquarters are located in Shanghai, China, not Fortaleza, Brazil. Fortaleza hosted a significant BRICS summit, but that's not where the bank is based.

2. **Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF):**  While IPEF has a significant focus on clean energy and sustainability, which contributes to climate change mitigation, it addresses a wider range of economic issues, including supply chain resilience, digital trade, and fair economy practices. The statement is too narrow.

3. **Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO):** Belarus officially joined the SCO in 2024, not before.  The statement is chronologically incorrect.

4. **G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative:** This initiative is led by the G7 group of nations, not the United Nations.  The UN may be involved in related efforts, but the G7 takes the lead.


The incorrect options serve as effective distractors, highlighting the need for precise knowledge and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts.


**3. With reference to  International Exercises, consider the following pairs:**

    Exercise Name                                  Participating Countries/Nature
1. IBSAMAR VIII                                   :   Bilateral exercise between India and Brazil
2. Exercise Pitch Black                           :   Annual multilateral air exercise
3. Exercise Orion                                 :   Exclusively involves European nations
4.  Exercise Malabar                             :   Involves only Asian nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Once again, none of the pairs are correctly matched.  The question tests knowledge of specific multinational military exercises.

1. **IBSAMAR VIII:** This is a joint multinational maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa, not a bilateral exercise between just India and Brazil.

2. **Exercise Pitch Black:**  This is a multinational air exercise held every two years, not annually.

3. **Exercise Orion:**  While many participants are European, Exercise Orion also involves non-European nations like the United States.  The statement is too restrictive.

4. **Exercise Malabar:**  This exercise involves both Asian and non-Asian nations (Australia, Japan, the United States, and India). The statement is inaccurate.


The distractors in the options are carefully chosen to be plausible but ultimately incorrect, requiring a precise understanding of the exercises' composition and frequency.


**4. With reference to Regional Organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Key Characteristic/Member
1. SAARC                                          :   Highly functional since 2016
2. ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation                 :   Does not include China
3.  BIMSTEC                                       :   Focuses solely on trade and security
4.  Quad                                           :   Includes only North American and Asian nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All pairs are incorrectly matched, necessitating precise knowledge of regional organizations.

1. **SAARC:** The South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) has been largely dysfunctional since 2016 due to various geopolitical tensions, not highly functional.

2. **ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation:** This grouping explicitly includes China, Japan, and South Korea in addition to ASEAN members.  The statement is false.

3. **BIMSTEC:** The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) has a broader focus than just trade and security, encompassing areas like environment, agriculture, and people-to-people contact.  The statement is too limited.

4. **Quad:** The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) includes Australia, India, Japan, and the United States.  While some are Asian, and one is North American, the statement incorrectly limits the regional representation.


The incorrect options are designed to be believable but ultimately wrong, making it essential for candidates to have a firm grasp of the facts about these organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Command                      Geographic Area of Primary Responsibility
1. Andaman and Nicobar Command         :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands
2. Strategic Forces Command             :   India's nuclear arsenal
3. Northern Command                     :   Western borders of India
4. Southern Naval Command               :   Eastern coast of India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Andaman and Nicobar Command is a tri-service command responsible for the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a strategically important archipelago in the Bay of Bengal. The Strategic Forces Command is responsible for the country's nuclear weapons and their deployment.  Option (a) correctly identifies these two commands and their areas of responsibility.

Option (c) is incorrect because the Southern Naval Command's area of responsibility is primarily the western coast of India, not the eastern coast. The Eastern Naval Command is responsible for the eastern coast.  Option (b) and (d) are incorrect as they include the Northern Command, which is an Army Command responsible for a specific geographical area along the northern border, and this is not accurately reflected in the pairing. The question deliberately uses plausible but incorrect geographic areas to test the candidate's precise knowledge of Indian military command structures.  The focus is on ensuring the candidate can accurately match the command to its core function and geographic area.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Organization                     Key Function/Objective
1. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 :   Empowers Commanders of Inter-Services Organizations with disciplinary powers over personnel
2. National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS)                               :   Provides long-term policy recommendations to the National Security Council
3.  Kargil Review Committee (KRC)                                            :   Reviewed the 1999 Kargil War and suggested defence improvements
4.  United Nations Security Council (UNSC)                                    :   Maintains international peace and security

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Inter-services Organisations Act, 2023, clearly aims to enhance the disciplinary and administrative powers of commanders within inter-service organizations. The NSCS plays a crucial role in advising the National Security Council on long-term strategies. The Kargil Review Committee was indeed tasked with reviewing the Kargil War and proposing improvements to India's defense structure. Finally, the UNSC is the primary body responsible for maintaining international peace and security, as per its charter. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of different organizations and their functions in the context of national and international security.  The inclusion of the UNSC, a well-known international body, serves as a potential distractor, ensuring the candidate accurately assesses each pair individually rather than relying on general knowledge.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                     Participating Nations (at least one)
1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas                 :   India and the United States
2. IBSAMAR VIII                          :   India, Brazil, and South Africa
3. Exercise Pitch Black                   :   Australia and the United States
4.  Exercise Malabar                      :   India, Japan, Australia, and the United States

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a regularly conducted joint military exercise between India and the United States. IBSAMAR VIII is a multinational maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa. Exercise Pitch Black is a large-scale multinational air exercise, with Australia and the United States being key participants.  Exercise Malabar is a significant annual maritime exercise involving India, the United States, Japan, and Australia.  The question assesses the candidate's awareness of key military exercises and their participating nations. The inclusion of both bilateral and multilateral exercises, along with a mix of land, sea, and air exercises, increases the difficulty level and tests the candidate's thorough understanding of the subject.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

  Organization/Agreement               Primary Focus/Objective
1.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)    :   Combating maritime terrorism and piracy
2.  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) :   Maintaining order in "disturbed areas"
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)  :   Monitoring and controlling the production and trafficking of narcotic drugs
4.  Global Energy Efficiency Alliance (GEEA)     :   Promoting renewable energy generation

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) are a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on counter-terrorism and counter-piracy operations. The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) grants special powers to the armed forces in areas deemed "disturbed," allowing them to maintain order and security. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) is a UN body that monitors and controls the production and trafficking of narcotic drugs.  However, Option 4 is incorrect; while the Global Energy Efficiency Alliance might indirectly contribute to renewable energy, its primary focus is not solely on renewable energy generation. This makes (b) the correct answer.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of various organizations and their specific mandates, requiring precise knowledge rather than general awareness. The inclusion of a plausible but slightly off-target option (GEEA) increases the difficulty.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative                     Participating Country/Entity
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council :    India
2. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)     :    Belarus
3. Group of Seven (G7) Summit                 :    Italy (Host Country)
4.  NATO                                      :    Sweden


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct because all four pairs are correctly matched.  India was elected Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council, confirming the first pair. Belarus joined the SCO as its tenth member, validating the second pair.  The 50th G7 Summit was held in Apulia, Italy, making the third pair accurate.  Finally, Sweden recently joined NATO as its 32nd member, thus making the fourth pair correct. The other options are incorrect because they exclude one or more of these correctly matched pairs.  The question tests factual recall of recent global events and the participation of various nations in different international organizations.  Understanding the roles and significance of these organizations within the global political and economic landscape is crucial for UPSC aspirants.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Agreement/Initiative             Key Feature/Outcome
1. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :  Global Connectivity Cornerstone
2. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  Review Meeting in Jakarta
3.  India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) :  Customs Union Formation
4.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework          :   Unanimity-Based Decision Making


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct. The IMEC is indeed presented as a cornerstone of global connectivity, making the first pair correct. The fifth joint committee meeting for AITIGA was held in Jakarta, validating the second pair. However, the third and fourth pairs are incorrect. The India-EFTA TEPA is not about forming a customs union; EFTA, unlike the EU, does not function as a customs union. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework is not directly related to unanimity-based decision-making within SAARC; that's a broader characteristic of the SAARC organization itself.  Thus, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include these mismatched pairs. This question assesses the candidate's understanding of specific economic agreements and their key features, requiring factual recall and the ability to differentiate between related but distinct concepts within international economic relations.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                   Characteristic/Action
1.  International Cooperative Alliance (ICA)  :   Global Regulatory Body for Cooperatives
2.  UN Security Council Resolution 1701     :    War between Russia and Ukraine
3.  OPEC+                                   :   Maximizes Oil Production as Primary Goal
4.  Geneva Conventions of 1949             :   Cornerstone of International Humanitarian Law


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 4 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the fourth pair is correctly matched. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 are indeed a cornerstone of International Humanitarian Law (IHL). The other options are incorrect. The ICA is a global organization uniting and representing cooperatives, not a regulatory body. UN Security Council Resolution 1701 aimed to end hostilities between Hezbollah and Israel, not the Russia-Ukraine war.  OPEC+ includes both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries and aims to manage oil supply and prices, not necessarily maximize production.  This question tests the candidate's ability to accurately recall the functions and objectives of various international organizations and agreements, highlighting the need for precise factual knowledge in international relations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                            Specific Economic Partnership/Initiative
1.  Singapore                               :   India's largest trade partner in ASEAN
2.  Vietnam                                 :   Comprehensive Strategic Partnership with India
3.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries:   India's largest trading partner bloc
4.  European Free Trade Association (EFTA) :   Customs Union with the European Union


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is correct as the first three pairs are correctly matched. Singapore is indeed India's largest trading partner within ASEAN.  India and Vietnam have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership. The GCC is currently India's largest trading partner bloc. However, the fourth pair is incorrect. EFTA is not a customs union with the European Union;  while some EFTA members participate in the European Economic Area (EEA), granting access to the EU's single market, EFTA itself maintains its own external tariffs. The other options are therefore incorrect because they include the incorrectly matched fourth pair. This question tests knowledge of India's bilateral and regional economic partnerships, requiring accurate factual recall and an understanding of the nuances of different trade agreements.



**5. Consider the following pairs:**

  International Organization/Fund             Specific Programme/Initiative
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):  Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
2. United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism (UNOCT):  Atoms4Food
3.  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI): World Military Expenditure Report
4. International Telecommunication Union (ITU):   Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the first and third pairs are correctly matched. The IAEA does maintain the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), and SIPRI publishes the World Military Expenditure Report. The other options are incorrect. UNOCT's focus is on counter-terrorism, not Atoms4Food, which is an IAEA initiative.  CFT is a UNOCT program, not an ITU program.  This question tests knowledge of various international organizations and their specific areas of work, demanding precise recall of programs and initiatives under each organization.  Understanding the mandates and activities of these bodies is key to analyzing global issues effectively.


**1. With reference to India's engagement with the Global South, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                    Specific Feature
    1. Social Impact Fund                       :   Contribution of $15 million for Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI)
    2. Global South Young Diplomat Forum       :   Focus on technological advancement and skill development
    3. Vision of Aarogya Maitri                 :   One World-One Health mission for health security
    4. Induction of African Union into G20      :   Permanent membership during India's G20 Presidency


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because statements 3 and 4 accurately reflect India's initiatives.  The Vision of Aarogya Maitri is indeed focused on a One World-One Health approach to global health security.  The African Union's induction as a permanent member of the G20 did occur during India's presidency.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the Social Impact Fund is a real initiative aimed at accelerating DPI in the Global South, the contribution amount is incorrectly stated as $15 million instead of the correct figure of $25 million. This inaccuracy renders the pairing incorrect.

Statement 2 is also incorrect.  Although the Global South Young Diplomat Forum does promote capacity building, the description of its focus as solely on "technological advancement and skill development" is an oversimplification. The forum's scope is broader, encompassing diplomatic skills and understanding of global issues.  The pairing is thus incorrectly matched.


**2. With reference to India's economic partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Initiative                       Key Characteristic
    1. India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) :   Established a customs union between India and EFTA members
    2. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)            :   India maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN nations
    3. India-GCC Relations                          :   GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, and India has a trade surplus
    4.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework          :    Agreement based on the principle of majority voting


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Statement 1 is incorrect because TEPA did not establish a customs union.  EFTA, unlike the EU, is not a customs union; its members retain individual external tariffs.

Statement 2 is incorrect because India has a trade deficit, not a surplus, with ASEAN nations under AITIGA.

Statement 3 is incorrect on two counts:  While the GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, India has a trade deficit, not a surplus, with GCC countries.

Statement 4 is incorrect as decisions in SAARC are taken by unanimity, not majority voting.


**3. With reference to India's international collaborations and initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative/Agreement                      Specific Detail
    1. Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI)    :   A treaty-based arrangement promoting cooperation in the Indo-Pacific
    2.  India-US relations                      :   India has a trade deficit with the United States
    3.  BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :   A payment system based on the SWIFT network
    4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Belarus is the 9th member to join SCO


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.

Statement 1 is incorrect because IPOI is a non-treaty based voluntary arrangement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India has a trade surplus, not a deficit, with the United States.

Statement 3 is incorrect as BCBPI is a blockchain-based system, offering an alternative to SWIFT.

Statement 4 is incorrect; Belarus is the 10th member to join the SCO, not the 9th.


**4. With reference to India's regional and global partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

    Partnership/Initiative                     Characteristic
    1.  Chabahar Port Agreement               :  Bypasses Pakistan for access to Central Asia
    2.  International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) :   Connects India to Europe via the Suez Canal
    3.  TAPI Gas Pipeline Project              :  Originates in the Galkynysh gas field in southern Turkmenistan
    4.  India-Singapore Relations              :  Singapore is India’s second largest trade partner globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correctly matched. The Chabahar Port agreement indeed provides India with a direct sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.

Statement 2 is incorrect; INSTC is an alternative to the Suez Canal route.

Statement 3 is incorrect as the Galkynysh gas field is located in *southeastern*, not southern, Turkmenistan.

Statement 4 is incorrect; Singapore is India's sixth largest trade partner globally, not the second largest.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise           Participating Countries
1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas       :   India-China
2. SALVEX                     :   India-Russia
3. Vajra Prahar                :   India-USA
4. Exercise Tarkash            :   India-UK
5. Exercise Shakti            :   India-France

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise between India and the USA, not India and China.  SALVEX is a naval exercise between India and the USA, not India and Russia.  Vajra Prahar is indeed a joint army exercise between India and the USA. Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the USA, not the UK.  Exercise Shakti is accurately paired with India and France. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) include incorrectly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of accurate knowledge about Indo-foreign military exercises.  Understanding these exercises is crucial for comprehending India's defense strategies and international relations. The incorrect pairings highlight the importance of precise knowledge in this area, as superficial knowledge can lead to inaccurate conclusions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization       Key Programme/Initiative
1. IAEA                            :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
2. ITU                             :   Atoms4Food
3. UNODC                           :   Incident and Trafficking Database
4. INCB                            :   Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does not manage the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI); that falls under the purview of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  The ITU's key initiative is not Atoms4Food; that is an IAEA program focused on enhancing food security using nuclear techniques.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is correctly linked to the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA), a crucial tool in combating organized crime.  The Incident and Trafficking Database is associated with the IAEA, not the UNODC. The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) does not handle the TOCTA; it is a UNODC program.  Thus, only pairs 3 and 4 represent accurate pairings.  The other options demonstrate a lack of understanding of the mandates and activities of these international organizations, highlighting the necessity of precise knowledge in international affairs.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Significant Recent Development
1.  Russia                      :   Legalization of same-sex marriage
2.  Thailand                   :   Withdrawal of peacekeepers from Nagorno-Karabakh
3.  Azerbaijan                 :   Successful completion of Arab world's first nuclear power plant
4.  UAE                         :   Emergency declared in Kursk Region
5.  India                       :   Election to steering committee of GlobE network


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Russia has not legalized same-sex marriage; this is inaccurate. Thailand recently approved a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, but this is not the correct pairing. Azerbaijan has not completed the Arab world's first nuclear power plant; that was the UAE.  The emergency in the Kursk Region was declared in Russia, not Azerbaijan.  India's election to the steering committee of the GlobE network is correctly matched. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  Incorrect pairings showcase the need for precise knowledge of current events and geopolitical developments.  The other options demonstrate a misunderstanding of recent events in these countries, emphasizing the importance of up-to-date information in international relations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographic Location        Description
1.  Lake Turkana              :   Located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, Africa’s 4th largest lake
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro          :   Highest peak in South America, a stratovolcano
3.  Lipulekh Pass              :   Situated in Sikkim, bordering Nepal and China
4.  Suez Canal                :   Connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea
5.  Chagos Islands             :   Island group in the Atlantic Ocean, south of Madagascar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The description of Lake Turkana is accurate. Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa, not South America. Lipulekh Pass is located in Uttarakhand, India, near the tri-junction with Nepal and China, not Sikkim. The description of the Suez Canal is correct. The Chagos Islands are in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  Incorrect pairings highlight the need for precise geographical knowledge. The other options demonstrate misconceptions about the location and characteristics of these geographical features, underscoring the importance of accurate geographical information.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                    Bilateral Relationship with India
1.  Maldives                  :   Launched RuPay card and signed Currency Swap Agreement
2.  Bhutan                    :   Construction of Kurichu, Tala, Chukha and Mangdechhu hydroelectric projects
3.  Mauritius                  :   First overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra inaugurated
4.  Rwanda                    :   Construction of the Greater Male Connectivity Project
5.  Democratic Republic of Congo:   Held the first secretary-level meeting between defence ministries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The description of the India-Maldives relationship is accurate.  India's involvement in Bhutan's hydroelectric projects is also correct. The inauguration of the first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Mauritius is accurate. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is in the Maldives, not Rwanda. The first secretary-level meeting between the defence ministries of India and the DRC is correctly paired. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  Incorrect pairings highlight the importance of accurate knowledge about India's bilateral relationships and development projects. The other options demonstrate a lack of precision regarding specific details in India's foreign policy and engagement with other nations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention         Key Feature/Provision
1. Geneva Protocol 1925                 :   Bans the use of chemical and biological weapons in conflict
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)  :   Established the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)
3. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Focuses on combating money laundering
4. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) :  A treaty for international cooperation in crime prevention


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 3 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices.  This directly aligns with pair 1.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) aims to eliminate chemical weapons and prevent their use.  It does *not* establish the INCB; that's a separate body under the UN. Thus, pair 2 is incorrect.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, is indeed focused on combating transnational organized crime, including money laundering. This makes pair 3 correct. Finally, a Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) facilitates international cooperation in criminal matters, including sharing information and evidence. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Body        Mandate/Activity
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)   :   Monitors illicit nuclear trafficking
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Assesses measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Releases reports on global drug trends
4. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) :  Promotes nuclear energy for net-zero emissions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d) 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The FATF's primary focus is on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, not illicit nuclear trafficking. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's mandate includes drug control and crime prevention, so it does release reports on global drug trends, making pair 3 incorrect. However, the UNODC's work extends beyond drug control and includes crime prevention and criminal justice. The IAEA's core function is to ensure the safe and peaceful use of nuclear energy, and one of its programs, Atoms4NetZero, directly aligns with promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions. Therefore, pair 4 is correct.  The ITU focuses on information and communication technologies, not nuclear energy.


**3. With reference to India's international engagements, consider the following pairs:**

   International Forum/Initiative        Key Feature/Participation
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) :   India is a Vice-Chair of its Supply Chain Council
2. India-GCC Relations                 :   India has a trade surplus with GCC countries
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) : Belarus recently joined as a member
4. Group of Seven (G7)                 : India is a permanent member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

India's participation in the IPEF and its role as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council are accurately reflected in pair 1.  Pair 2 is incorrect; India has a trade *deficit* with GCC countries, not a surplus. The SCO's expansion to include Belarus is correctly stated in pair 3.  Pair 4 is incorrect; India is not a permanent member of the G7; it participates as an outreach country.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                     Purpose/Feature
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :  Combats money laundering
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :  Deals with terrorist financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000           :  Regulates the use of cannabis
4. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 :  Grants special powers to armed forces in specific areas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1, 2 and 4 only

**Explanation:**

The PMLA directly addresses money laundering, making pair 1 correct. The UAPA is designed to combat unlawful activities, including those related to terrorism and terrorist financing, thus pair 2 is correct. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act implements the international treaty on chemical weapons, not cannabis regulation, making pair 3 incorrect.  The AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in designated areas, making pair 4 correct.


**5. With reference to India's defense and security partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                        Key Feature
1. Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) :  Imposes sanctions on countries engaging with Russia, North Korea, and Iran
2. Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) :  Facilitates cooperation in critical and emerging technologies
3. Technology Security Initiative (TSI)         :  Enables logistical support between the Indian and US militaries
4.  Major Defence Partner (MDP) designation by the US :  A legally binding agreement


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a) 1 only

**Explanation:**

CAATSA's purpose is accurately described in pair 1. LEMOA facilitates logistical support, not cooperation in critical technologies; that's the TSI's role, making pairs 2 and 3 incorrect.  The MDP designation is not a legally binding agreement; it's a policy designation, making pair 4 incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Specific Initiative/Action
1. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative
2. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :  Acts as the secretariat for UNTOC
3. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  Has a Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process
4. Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network :  Focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is indeed involved in a Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process, which assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. This is a core part of its mandate in tackling transnational organized crime.

Option 1 is incorrect because the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative is associated with the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), not the INCB.  The INCB focuses on drug control.

Option 2 is incorrect because while UNTOC is a significant treaty in combating transnational organized crime, the UNODC, not UNTOC itself, acts as its secretariat. UNTOC is a framework; UNODC is the implementing body.

Option 4 is incorrect. The Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) which focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking is a key program of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), not the GLOBE Network. The GLOBE network focuses on anti-corruption efforts.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Treaty                     Key Feature/Action
1.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)        :    Seized drugs in the Arabian Sea under Operation Crimson Barracuda
2.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)                 :    Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3.  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)      :    Uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security
4.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)               :   Adopted India’s Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) 4 only. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) did indeed adopt India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), which assesses the country's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Option 1 is incorrect. The IAEA focuses on nuclear issues; drug seizures are the domain of maritime forces or law enforcement agencies.

Option 2 is incorrect. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational naval coalition; the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 was released by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).

Option 3 is incorrect. The "Atoms4Food" program, which uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security, is an IAEA initiative, not an ITU one.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region/Area                                     Characteristic Description
1. Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent)     :    Includes Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay
2. Triple Frontier Area                           :    Includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand
3. Golden Triangle (renamed Death Triangle)     :    Includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran
4.  Canada                                        :   Has legalized cannabis in 27 jurisdictions


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only. The Golden Crescent, now often referred to as the Death Crescent, correctly includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran—regions known for significant opium production.

Option 1 is incorrect. The Triple Frontier Area, a region where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is known for its drug trafficking, not the Golden Crescent.

Option 2 is incorrect. The Golden Triangle (Death Triangle), comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is another significant drug-producing region, distinct from the Golden Crescent.

Option 4 is partially correct in that Canada has legalized cannabis, but the statement that it has done so in 27 jurisdictions is incorrect and misleading as it conflates the situation with that of the United States.  The question is testing for precise geographical regions associated with drug production.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                  Focus Area
1.  Geneva Conventions of 1949                   :   Combating money laundering and terrorist financing
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)            :   Protecting victims of armed conflict
3.  Biological Weapons Convention                  :   Prohibits development and use of biological weapons
4.  Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only. The Biological Weapons Convention accurately focuses on prohibiting the development and use of biological weapons.

Option 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions address international humanitarian law, protecting victims of armed conflict, not financial crimes.  That is the domain of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).

Option 2 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions, not the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), primarily protect victims of armed conflict. The CWC focuses specifically on chemical weapons.

Option 4 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court (ICC), but it deals with war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, not the banning of chemical weapons (that's the CWC).


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                         Primary Objective/Focus
1.  BRICS New Development Bank (NDB)           :   Combating cervical cancer
2.  Quad Cancer Moonshot partnership             :   Funding infrastructure in BRICS and emerging economies
3.  BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity :   Sustainable port infrastructure development
4.  Quad Ports of the Future Partnership           :   Enhancing regional trade and connectivity


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 and 4 only. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity aims to improve regional transport infrastructure, facilitating trade and connectivity.  Similarly, the Quad Ports of the Future Partnership focuses on sustainable port infrastructure development within the Indo-Pacific region.

Option 1 is incorrect. The BRICS New Development Bank (NDB) funds infrastructure projects in BRICS and other emerging economies, not cancer initiatives.

Option 2 is incorrect. The Quad Cancer Moonshot partnership is specifically aimed at combating cervical cancer, not infrastructure development.  The NDB's focus is infrastructure.

4. Senkaku Islands                     :   China
5. Chagos Islands                       :   Mauritius


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Abu Musa Island is a subject of a territorial dispute between Iran and the United Arab Emirates.  While Iran currently controls the island, the UAE maintains its claim to sovereignty.  Therefore, pairing Abu Musa Island with the UAE is incorrect.  Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb islands are undeniably under Iranian control, and Iran's claim to these islands is well-established. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands in China) are claimed by both China and Japan. Therefore, pairing them with China is not entirely accurate, as Japan also asserts its claim.  Finally, the Chagos Islands, following a decision by the International Court of Justice, are rightfully claimed by Mauritius, which had previously been under British control.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

(c) 1, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf of Aden correctly connects the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea. The Indian Ocean surrounds the Maldives on all sides. The Gulf of Guinea borders Togo. However, the 8 and 9 Degree Channels are incorrectly paired with their separating locations.  The 8 Degree Channel separates Minicoy Island from the Maldives, not the Lakshadweep archipelago.  The 9 Degree Channel separates Minicoy Island from the main Lakshadweep archipelago.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographic Feature                          Location

(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Philippines shares a maritime border with the South China Sea. Myanmar has the Rakhine State as one of its constituent regions.  Bangladesh has sovereignty over Saint Martin's Island.  However, Indonesia's relationship with West Papua is complex, involving an independence movement. While West Papua is geographically part of Indonesia, it is not a neighboring country in the traditional sense.  Mexico is definitively not located in the Asia-Pacific region.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) :   Established the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes.
    4.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 (India)   :   Enacted to comply with the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention accurately prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. Similarly, the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention correctly bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and the crime of aggression.  India's Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, was indeed enacted to fulfill the country's obligations under the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. Consider the following pairs related to India's bilateral relations:**

    Country                Specific Initiative/Agreement

    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India is actively involved in the Greater Male Connectivity Project in the Maldives, a significant infrastructure development initiative.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, symbolizing energy cooperation.  Bhutan's Chukha Hydropower Project is a long-standing example of India-Bhutan cooperation in the energy sector.  The recent disengagement agreement between India and China in the Depsang Plains area is a testament to ongoing efforts to de-escalate border tensions. All four pairs accurately reflect specific initiatives or agreements within the respective bilateral relationships.  Thus, option (d) encompassing all four pairs is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**4. With reference to India's participation in international forums, consider the following pairs:**

    Forum/Organization                         Specific Participation/Role
    1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)  :   Elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council
    2.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Belarus's accession as a member state
    3.  Group of Seven (G7)                     :   Invited as an Outreach Country
    4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)            :   Released commemorative postage stamps for UPU's 150th anniversary

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's active role in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) includes its election as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council.  India's participation in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is marked by the recent accession of Belarus as a member state. India's engagement with the Group of Seven (G7) includes its invitation as an Outreach Country to the summit. Finally, India's participation in the Universal Postal Union (UPU) involved the release of commemorative postage stamps to mark the 150th anniversary.  All four pairs accurately represent India's participation and role in these international forums. Option (d), which includes all four correctly matched pairs, is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.



**5. With reference to  International Organizations focused on Nuclear and Energy matters, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                         Key Program/Area of Focus
    1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Atoms4Food initiative
    2. International Solar Alliance (ISA)       :   Promoting solar energy cooperation among member countries
    3. OPEC+                                  :  Oil production cuts extension into 2025
    4. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 1, 2, and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative uses nuclear techniques to enhance global food security. The International Solar Alliance (ISA) focuses on promoting solar energy cooperation among its member nations. OPEC+, a group of oil-producing countries, recently agreed to extend oil production cuts. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is indeed focused on assisting low-income countries in securing financial resources for infrastructure projects.  All the pairs correctly link the organization with its area of focus or key program. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer as it includes all four correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Initiative/Program
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :  Atoms4NetZero
2. BRICS                                        :  Contingent Reserve Arrangement
3. Group of Seven (G7)                         :  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Strategy

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program is a key initiative aimed at promoting the use of nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions.  This aligns perfectly with global efforts to mitigate climate change and is a well-known IAEA program.  The BRICS group has established the Contingent Reserve Arrangement (CRA) as a mechanism to provide short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payments difficulties. This is a crucial aspect of BRICS's financial cooperation.  Option 3 is incorrect. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Development Strategy is not an initiative of the G7. The G7 focuses on issues of global economic governance and cooperation among its member states, while the SCO is a separate organization with its own strategic objectives and development plans.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                      Key Feature/Activity
1.  International Telecommunication Union (ITU) : Released Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
2.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)          :  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India
3.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) :  India-GCC Political Dialogue

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 is a well-documented event reflecting its role in assessing global cybersecurity commitments. The FATF's adoption of the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India is also a key activity of the organization, focusing on assessing India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.  However, Option 3 is incorrect. The India-GCC Political Dialogue is not a feature or activity of ASEAN.  ASEAN is a regional organization focused on Southeast Asia, while the India-GCC Political Dialogue involves India and the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**3. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Specific Function/Role
1.  New Development Bank (NDB)                :  Funds infrastructure in BRICS and emerging economies
2.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)               :  Facilitates defence cooperation and crisis management
3.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) : Assists low-income countries in accessing financial resources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The New Development Bank (NDB), established within the BRICS framework, focuses on funding infrastructure projects in BRICS and emerging economies. This is a core function of the NDB. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is designed to support infrastructure development and facilitate access to financial resources for its member countries, particularly low-income nations.  Option 2 is incorrect. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations primarily focused on postal services and international mail exchange. It does not have functions related to defense cooperation or crisis management. That is the role of organizations like NATO.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention         Focus Area
1.  1972 Biological Weapons Convention      :  Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons
2.  1993 Chemical Weapons Convention       :  Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
3.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  Reduces trade barriers between ASEAN and India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention accurately reflect their respective focuses on prohibiting the development and use of biological and chemical weapons.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers and enhance economic ties between ASEAN member states and India. All three pairs accurately link the agreement/convention with its core objective. Therefore, all three pairs (1, 2, and 3) are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to international relations, consider the following pairs:**

   International Grouping/Forum              Specific Characteristic
1.  G4 Nations                               :  Advocates for UN Security Council reform
2.  Uniting for Consensus (UfC)              :  Opposes G4 nations' bid for permanent UNSC seats
3.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) :  Includes Ukraine as a member state

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The G4 nations (Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan) are known for their collective advocacy for reform of the United Nations Security Council, seeking permanent seats. The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group explicitly opposes the G4's bid for permanent UNSC seats.  Option 3 is incorrect.  Ukraine is not currently a member state of NATO, despite having applied for membership. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Focus Area
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :  Sustainable agriculture
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative           :  Clean energy projects in Africa
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) :  Combating money laundering

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to mobilize funding for infrastructure projects in developing nations, focusing on sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure.  While sustainable development is a broad goal,  its primary focus isn't specifically sustainable agriculture.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, as its name suggests, directly targets facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects across the African continent. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) deals with ocean conservation and sustainability, not with financial crimes like money laundering. Therefore, only pair 2 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include incorrectly matched pairs.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's precise understanding of each initiative's core objective.  A superficial understanding might lead to incorrect pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                                    Core Purpose
1. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000         :   Combating terrorism
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
3. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Combating money laundering

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention Act of 2000 is a domestic implementation of the international Chemical Weapons Convention, aiming to prohibit the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  It does not primarily address terrorism. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002 focuses on preventing and combating money laundering, a financial crime. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) of 1967 primarily deals with unlawful activities, including those that threaten national security and can often be linked to terrorist financing.  Therefore, pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they misrepresent the core purposes of at least one of the Acts/Conventions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of Indian legislation and its alignment with international conventions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                            Key Report/Database

2. IAEA                                             :   World Drug Day Report
3. ITU                                               :   Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) releases various reports related to drug abuse and illicit trafficking, including the Annual Report on World Drug Day. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) maintains the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) to monitor and report illicit nuclear trafficking. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) publishes the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI).  Only pair 3 correctly matches the organization with its key report/database. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they misattribute reports/databases to the wrong organizations. This question tests the candidate’s understanding of the mandates and activities of key international organizations.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                           Key Initiative/Program

2.  UNCTAD                                           :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
3.  IAEA                                             :   DMFAS Programme

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) conducts mutual evaluations of countries' anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) measures.  The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has initiatives like the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) Programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has programs like Atoms4Food, which uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security. Only pair 3 correctly matches the organization with its initiative. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they incorrectly link organizations to initiatives outside their purview.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the work of specific international organizations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Regional/International Grouping                     Key Feature/Initiative

2. ASEAN                                             :   BIMSTEC Charter
3.  QUAD                                              :  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) has its own charter, not the IPOI. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF), not the BIMSTEC Charter.  The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) is a separate grouping focused on the Indo-Pacific, and it does not include the ARF. None of the pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they incorrectly link groupings to features or initiatives belonging to other groupings. This question tests the candidate’s ability to distinguish between different regional and international groupings and their respective activities.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) :  Punishes countries engaging deeply with Russia, North Korea, and Iran
3.  Biological Weapons Convention                    :   Establishes the International Criminal Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) imposes sanctions, not prohibitions on biological weapons.  The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court (ICC), not CAATSA. The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.  Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of international laws/treaties and their key provisions. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of international law and treaties.

(b) 1, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia is correct.  The statement that Maldives has a Currency Swap Agreement with India is also correct.  The statement that China is India's largest trading partner in goods (2023) is correct.  However, the statement that Bhutan is India's leading source of investments in Bhutan is incorrect; India is the leading source of investments in Bhutan.  The statement that Nepal signed an FTA with India in 2016 is incorrect; Bhutan signed an FTA with India in 2016. This question tests factual recall of India's economic relations with its neighboring countries and China.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, forcing the candidate to carefully consider each pair.  The correct answer requires precise knowledge of trade dynamics and bilateral agreements.  Understanding the economic relationships between India and its neighbors is vital for the UPSC exam.

The FATF is indeed known for its work in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, employing Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) as a key assessment tool. The UNODC publishes comprehensive reports on global drug trends, illicit trafficking, and wildlife crime.  The INCB plays a vital role in monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties.  The CCPCJ addresses transnational organized crime and actively involves youth in crime prevention and criminal justice initiatives.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect due to the exclusion of one or more correctly matched pairs.  A thorough understanding of these international organizations and their respective mandates is essential for comprehending global security and governance issues, a crucial aspect for UPSC preparation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                    Significant Feature Related to Energy/Trade

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair correctly links a country with a specific energy or trade-related feature. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia. Nepal, along with India and Bangladesh, has signed an agreement to facilitate cross-border electricity trade, showcasing regional energy cooperation. Bhutan actively collaborates with India on hydropower projects, including Kurichu and Tala, highlighting their energy partnership.  Finally, the Maldives and India have launched the RuPay card, signifying enhanced financial and economic cooperation. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer as it includes all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude one or more correctly matched pairs.  Understanding India's bilateral relations with its neighbors and the specifics of these collaborations is critical for the UPSC exam, as it showcases India's foreign policy and regional engagement.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization/Initiative        Key Initiative or Feature
    1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)  :   Established a Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and Labor Rights Advisory Board
    2. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) :   Belarus joined as the 10th member
    3. Group of Seven (G7)                     :   Launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
    4. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Aimed at assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the activities or features of the respective organizations. The IPEF, a significant initiative focusing on economic cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, indeed established a Supply Chain Council, a Crisis Response Network, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board. The SCO, a prominent Eurasian political, economic, and security organization, welcomed Belarus as its tenth member.  The G7, a group of leading industrialized nations, launched the PGII to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries.  Finally, the AIIB has the stated objective of assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources for development projects.  Therefore, option (d) is correct, encompassing all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.  Knowledge of these international organizations and their activities is essential for understanding global economic and political dynamics, a key area for UPSC aspirants.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country/Region                             Significant Geopolitical or Strategic Feature
    1. Japan                                     :  Composed of four main islands (Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, Kyushu)
    2. Russia                                   :   Volga River (longest river in Europe)
    3. Singapore                                :   India’s largest trade partner in ASEAN
    4. Vietnam                                  :   Undertook a state visit to India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Three out of the four pairs are correctly matched.  Japan is indeed composed of four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu. The Volga River is the longest river in Europe, a key geographical feature of Russia.  Singapore is correctly identified as India's largest trading partner within the ASEAN bloc. However, the statement that Vietnam "undertook a state visit to India" is a description of an event, not a consistent geographic or strategic feature of Vietnam itself. Therefore, option (d) is correct, including the three correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they either exclude correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair related to Vietnam.  Understanding the geographical and strategic features of various countries is crucial for UPSC preparation, as it forms the basis for geopolitical analysis and understanding international relations.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative          Key Feature/Initiative
1.  INCB                                      :  Re-election of Jagjit Pavadia for a third term
2.  UNODC                                     :  Global Firearms Programme (GFP)
3.  SAWEN                                     :  Established in 2002
4.  GlobE Network                             :  India elected to its steering committee


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) did indeed re-elect Jagjit Pavadia for a third term (2025-2030).  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is correctly paired with the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) as one of its initiatives.  GlobE Network's steering committee election of India is also factually accurate. However, SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) was established in 2011, not 2002, making option (d) incorrect. Option (a) and (b) are incomplete, while option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the roles and functions of these international organizations is crucial for comprehending global efforts in drug control, crime prevention, and wildlife protection.  The correct answer emphasizes the importance of knowing specific details about these organizations, moving beyond general knowledge to demonstrate a deeper understanding of international cooperation in these fields.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                                      Specific Provision/Feature
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000          :  Prohibits the development of biological weapons
2.  Inter-services Organisations Act, 2023           :  Empowers C-i-C with disciplinary powers over attached personnel
3.  Disaster Management Act, 2005                  :  Established the NDMA as an apex body headed by the President
4.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :  Established the FIU-IND in 2004


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, correctly empowers the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) with disciplinary and administrative powers.  The other options contain inaccuracies. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, doesn't prohibit biological weapons; that's covered by a separate convention. The Disaster Management Act, 2005, established the NDMA, but it's headed by the Prime Minister, not the President.  Finally, while the PMLA, 2002, did lead to the establishment of the FIU-IND, its establishment date is 2004, not 2002. Therefore, only statement 2 is correctly matched, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge of legislation and its key features. The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between closely related acts and their specific provisions, demanding detailed factual recall.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region/Area                                        Characteristic Feature
1.  Golden Crescent                                   :  Includes Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran
2.  Triple Frontier Area                              :  Comprises Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay
3.  Death Triangle (renamed Golden Triangle)       :  Includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand
4.  Areas with Cannabis Legalisation                 :   Includes Canada, Uruguay, and 27 US states


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Golden Crescent, indeed, comprises Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran. The Triple Frontier Area accurately consists of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The Death Triangle (formerly the Golden Triangle) correctly includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand. Lastly, the regions with legalized cannabis include Canada, Uruguay, and 27 US jurisdictions. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical locations and contemporary geopolitical realities related to drug production and consumption. The inclusion of all correct pairs requires precise geographical knowledge, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of global drug trafficking patterns.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Treaty                                 Purpose/Membership
1.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :  Supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003
2.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution : Ratified by India
3.  BIMSTEC                                            :  Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force
4.  Commonwealth                                         :  King Charles III is the Head of State in all member countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNTOC is correctly paired with its supplementation by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003. BIMSTEC correctly acquired legal personality after the charter's ratification. However, the SAARC convention's ratification by India is not explicitly stated in the provided text, and the Commonwealth's head of state is not the head of state for all member countries; many are republics.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are definitively correct, showcasing the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information and identify only verifiable facts. The question emphasizes the need for precise understanding of international treaties and organizations, testing detailed factual recall and analytical skills.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Characteristic
1. National Security Council (NSC)             :   Headed by the Prime Minister
2. Strategic Policy Group (SPG)                :   Headed by the National Security Advisor
3. National Security Advisory Board (NSAB)     :   Provides short-term policy recommendations to NSC

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The National Security Council (NSC), established in 1999, is indeed headed by the Prime Minister of India.  This is a fundamental aspect of its structure, designed to place the highest level of political authority at the helm of national security policymaking.  The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), a key component of the NSC, is correctly paired with its head, the National Security Advisor (NSA). The NSA plays a crucial role in coordinating inter-ministerial efforts for national security policies.  However, the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) is incorrectly paired with the description "Provides short-term policy recommendations to NSC". The NSAB's primary function is to provide long-term analysis and policy recommendations, focusing on strategic foresight and long-term planning for national security, not short-term recommendations.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Body                                    Function
1. Andaman and Nicobar Command                  :   Single-service oriented command
2. Strategic Forces Command                      :   In charge of the country's nuclear stockpile
3. Department of Military Affairs (DMA)          :   Headed by the three Service Chiefs

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command are correctly identified. The Andaman and Nicobar Command functions as a tri-services command, not a single-service command, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Strategic Forces Command is accurately described as being in charge of India's nuclear stockpile.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) is headed by the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS), not the three Service Chiefs. The CDS acts as the principal military advisor to the Ministry of Defence on tri-services matters, but the Service Chiefs retain operational command of their respective forces. Thus, only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                              Provision
1. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023   :   Limits the powers of the Commander-in-Chief
2. Chemical Weapons Convention, 1993           :   Allows the use of chemical weapons under specific conditions
3. Biological Weapons Convention, 1972       :   Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, aims to *empower* the Commander-in-Chief and Officer-in-Command with disciplinary and administrative powers, not limit them, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Chemical Weapons Convention, 1993, unequivocally *bans* the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, contrary to statement 2. The Biological Weapons Convention, 1972, accurately prohibits the development and use of biological weapons. Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Focus Area
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)        :   Combating money laundering and terrorist financing
2.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)  :   Promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions
3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)          :   Combating drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's primary focus is accurately described as combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The IAEA's involvement in promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions through initiatives like Atoms4NetZero is also correct. However, the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) primarily operates in the Arabian Sea and focuses on maritime security, not specifically drug trafficking in the Pacific Ocean, making statement 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                 Key Activity/Initiative
1.  BIMSTEC                               :   Focuses primarily on South American countries
2.  SCO                                   :   Recently admitted Belarus as a member
3.  G7                                    :  Headed by a rotating presidency

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) is a regional organization focused on South Asia, not South America, making statement 1 incorrect.  The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) did indeed recently admit Belarus as its tenth member. The Group of Seven (G7) operates under a rotating annual presidency, correctly reflecting its working mechanism. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Characteristic
1. Commonwealth of Nations                     :   Decisions made by consensus; all members considered equal.
2. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)               :   First India-GCC Political Dialogue held in 2005.
3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Established in 2016.
4.  India-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)   :   Includes a Supply Chain Council.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth of Nations operates on a consensus-based decision-making process where all member states hold equal standing. This is a fundamental principle of the organization's structure and functioning.  The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was actually held in 2003, not 2005, making option 2 incorrect.  The AIIB was established in 2016, not earlier, making option 3 correct. The IPEF does indeed include a Supply Chain Council as a key component of its structure, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                       Specific Initiative/Feature
1. World Press Freedom Index (WPFI)           :   Top 3 rankers are Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)  :   Released the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.
3.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)         :   Conducts peer reviews of countries’ anti-money laundering measures.
4.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Based in Vienna, Austria

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The World Press Freedom Index (WPFI) consistently ranks Norway, Denmark, and Sweden among the top countries for press freedom, making statement 1 correct. The UNODC is indeed responsible for releasing reports, including the World Wildlife Crime Report, verifying statement 2.  The FATF's core function is the peer review of countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, making statement 3 correct. While the INCB is an important international body, its location is not the primary focus of its function. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                     Key Provision/Feature
1. Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023  :   Empowers Commanders-in-Chief of Inter-Services Organizations with disciplinary powers.
2. Chemical Weapons Convention, 1993             :   Prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.
3. Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 :   Grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas".
4.  Biological Weapons Convention, 1972           :  Established the International Criminal Court.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Inter-services Organisations Act of 2023 explicitly grants extensive disciplinary and administrative authority to the Commanders-in-Chief of Inter-Services Organizations, making statement 1 accurate. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 is a comprehensive treaty that prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, aligning with statement 2.  The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958, commonly known as AFSPA, grants special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas," verifying statement 3.  The establishment of the International Criminal Court (ICC) is attributed to the Rome Statute of 1998, not the Biological Weapons Convention, making statement 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Significant Bilateral Agreement/Initiative
1. Bangladesh                                 :   Joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is a documented fact, making statement 1 correct. Nepal's involvement in the trilateral agreement on cross-border electricity trade with India and Bangladesh is also confirmed, verifying statement 2.  India's participation in the G7 Summit as an Outreach Country is a matter of record, making statement 3 correct.  Belarus's recent accession to the SCO, becoming its 10th member, is also accurate, confirming statement 4.  Therefore, all four pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Body/Agreement                 Relevant Action/Outcome
1.  United Nations Security Council (UNSC)     : Launched the Common Pledge Initiative to enhance women's participation in peace processes.
2.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)              :  Celebrated its 150th anniversary with commemorative postage stamps.
3.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ):  Launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative.
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                        :  Launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII).


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The UNSC's involvement in the Common Pledge Initiative, aimed at promoting women's participation in peace processes, is accurately reflected in statement 1. The UPU's 150th-anniversary celebration with commemorative stamps is a documented event, making statement 2 correct. The CCPCJ's launch of the Generation Justice initiative is a confirmed action, verifying statement 3. The G7's initiation of the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is also a matter of public record, confirming statement 4.  Therefore, all four pairs (1, 2, 3, and 4) are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Feature                     Location
1. Lake Turkana                           :   Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                       :   South Africa
3. Lipulekh Pass                           :   Tri-junction of India, Bhutan, and Nepal
4. Suez Canal                             :   Panama

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is indeed situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  This is a well-established geographical fact. Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not South Africa.  The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not India, Bhutan, and Nepal. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, it is not located in Panama.  The Panama Canal is a separate waterway. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched. Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, making (a) the only accurate choice.  Understanding the precise geographical locations of significant landmarks is crucial for UPSC preparation, as questions often test knowledge of specific locations and their geopolitical significance.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

BIMSTEC's adoption of a legally binding charter is a confirmed event.  Belarus's recent membership in the SCO is a matter of public record. The G7's lack of a permanent structure is a known feature.  Finally, the adoption of the Wilmington Declaration by the Quad is a confirmed event.  All pairs are accurately matched, making option (d) the only correct answer. The other options are incorrect as they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                 Specific Bilateral Initiative/Agreement
1.  India and Bangladesh                  : Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT)
2.  India and Maldives                     : Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)
3.  India and Singapore                    : Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA)
4.  India and Vietnam                      :  Elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024
5. India and Malaysia                     : Joint Committee Meeting of Malaysia-India Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (MICECA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect specific bilateral initiatives or agreements between the mentioned countries. The PIWTT is a well-established agreement between India and Bangladesh. The CSA is a recently signed agreement between India and the Maldives. The CECA is a significant trade agreement between India and Singapore. The elevation of the India-Vietnam relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024 is a confirmed development. Finally, the Joint Committee Meeting for MICECA signifies ongoing cooperation between India and Malaysia.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following pairs:**

   **Act/Institution**                                  **Prominent Feature**
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)      :   Launched the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal in 2022
3. Directorate of Enforcement (ED)                 :   Established in 1956 to combat money laundering
4. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967:   Primarily focuses on combating terrorism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, while not directly establishing the FIU-IND, provides the legal framework under which the FIU operates.  The FIU-IND was established in 2004,  its creation is directly linked to India's commitment to combat money laundering as mandated by PMLA.  Option 1 is therefore indirectly correct. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, plays a crucial role in enforcing the PMLA and other laws related to financial crimes, including money laundering.  Option 3 is correct. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, is primarily concerned with combating terrorism and related unlawful activities. Option 4 is correct. Option 2 is incorrect;  the FIU-IND did not launch the MLAT portal; it facilitates the use of the portal for international cooperation.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following pairs:**

   **Report**                                          **Key Finding/Focus**
1. Annual Report on World Drug Day                 :   Focuses on the legalisation of cannabis in various jurisdictions.
2. World Wildlife Crime Report 2024               :   Highlights the "Triple Frontier Area" as a region significantly affected by drug trafficking.
3. World Drug Day Report                          :   Identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally.
4. World Drug Day Report                          :   Highlights the Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent) as a major drug production area.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC's Annual Report on World Drug Day does indeed discuss the legalization of cannabis in various countries, making option 1 correct. The report also correctly identifies cannabis as the most widely abused drug and highlights the Golden Crescent (renamed Death Crescent) as a major drug production region, making options 3 and 4 correct.  However, while the World Wildlife Crime Report may touch upon illegal wildlife trade linked to drug trafficking, its primary focus is not specifically on the "Triple Frontier Area" in the context of drug trafficking. The Triple Frontier area is highlighted in the World Drug Day Report, Therefore, option 2 is incorrect.


**3. With reference to international organizations and agreements, consider the following pairs:**

   **Organization/Agreement**                        **Key Feature/Initiative**
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)              :   Enacted in India as the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000
2. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)        :   Operates the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) to monitor illicit nuclear material.
3.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Has the UNODC as its secretariat.
4.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)     :   Jagjit Pavadia's re-election for a third term (2025-2030)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India is a signatory to and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, making option 1 correct. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) is a key tool for monitoring illicit nuclear trafficking, making option 2 correct. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), making option 3 correct.  Finally, the re-election of Jagjit Pavadia to the INCB for a third term is a factual event, making option 4 correct.  Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to India's engagement with regional and international initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative/Agreement**                            **Key Aspect**
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF):   India signed agreements focusing on Clean Economy and Fair Economy pillars
2. BIMSTEC Charter                                    :   Came into force on May 20, 2024
3.  Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC)  :   Acquired legal personality after the charter came into force.
4.  SAARC                                              :   Has been largely dysfunctional since 2016


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's participation in the IPEF and its signing of agreements under the Clean Economy and Fair Economy pillars are accurately reflected in option 1. The BIMSTEC Charter coming into force on May 20, 2024, and BIMSTEC acquiring legal personality as a result are both factual, making options 2 and 3 correct. The statement regarding SAARC's dysfunctionality since 2016 is also a widely accepted assessment of the organization's state, making option 4 correct. Therefore, all pairs are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to cross-border initiatives and energy cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

   **Initiative/Project**                                 **Key Feature/Country**

4.  Katihar (Bihar)-Bornagar (Assam) Electricity Corridor:   An upcoming project to facilitate cross-border electricity trade between India and Bangladesh


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is indeed a key initiative for natural gas transport, making option 1 correct.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh project, making option 2 correct. The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects represent cross-border energy cooperation between India and Nepal, making option 3 correct. The planned Katihar-Bornagar electricity corridor aims to enhance cross-border electricity trade between India and Bangladesh, making option 4 correct.  All pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                     Participating Countries
1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas                 :   India and Japan
2. SALVEX                               :   India and South Korea
3. Vajra Prahar                          :   India and the United Kingdom
4. Sea Defenders-2024                   :   India and Canada


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched.  Let's analyze each:

1. **Exercise Yudh Abhyas:** This is an annual joint military exercise between India and the **United States**, not Japan.  The exercise focuses on enhancing interoperability and cooperation between the two armies.

2. **SALVEX:**  This naval exercise is conducted between India and the **United States**, not South Korea. It involves various maritime operations and tactical exercises.

3. **Vajra Prahar:** This is a joint army exercise between India and the **United States**, not the United Kingdom.  The exercise emphasizes counter-terrorism and other joint military operations.

4. **Sea Defenders-2024:** This maritime security exercise is conducted between India and the **United States**, not Canada. It aims to improve cooperation in areas such as maritime security, search and rescue, and combating illegal activities at sea.


The options provided include various combinations of these incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge of military exercises and their participating nations.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings serves as a key distractor in this UPSC-style question.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                      Location
1. Exercise Nomadic Elephant           :   Rajasthan
2. Exercise KAZIND-2024               :   Uttarakhand
3. Exercise Lamitiye 2024              :   Goa
4. Exercise AL NAJAH V                :   Andaman and Nicobar Islands


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Only two pairs are correctly matched:

1. **Exercise Nomadic Elephant:** This joint military exercise between India and Mongolia is **incorrectly** listed as taking place in Rajasthan.  The provided text actually states that it will be conducted in **Meghalaya**.

2. **Exercise KAZIND-2024:** This annual joint military exercise between India and Kazakhstan is **correctly** listed as taking place in Uttarakhand.  The text specifies the location as Surya Foreign Training Node in Auli, Uttarakhand.

3. **Exercise Lamitiye 2024:** This joint military exercise between the Indian Army and Seychelles Defence Forces is **incorrectly** listed as taking place in Goa. The actual location is not specified in the provided text.

4. **Exercise AL NAJAH V:** This joint military exercise between India and Oman is **incorrectly** listed as taking place in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The provided text does not give a specific location.


The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the locations of specific military exercises. The incorrect options are designed to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between correct and incorrect information.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect locations acts as a significant distractor.


**3. With reference to multilateral military exercises, consider the following pairs:**

   Exercise Name                       Primary Focus
1. IBSAMAR VIII                        :   Counter-terrorism
2. RIMPAC                               :   Anti-submarine warfare
3. Exercise Pitch Black                  :   Cybersecurity
4. Exercise Cutlass Express             :   Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. Let's examine each one:

1. **IBSAMAR VIII:** This joint multinational maritime exercise among India, Brazil, and South Africa focuses on various aspects of maritime cooperation, including **naval exercises and interoperability**, not solely counter-terrorism.

2. **RIMPAC:** The world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, RIMPAC, encompasses a wide range of naval operations, including anti-submarine warfare, but it is not exclusively focused on it. The exercise covers various aspects of maritime security and cooperation.

3. **Exercise Pitch Black:** This multinational air exercise focuses on air combat and air power projection, not cybersecurity.  It involves various air-to-air and air-to-ground scenarios.

4. **Exercise Cutlass Express:** While humanitarian assistance and disaster relief might be a component, this U.S. Naval Forces-led multinational maritime exercise primarily focuses on enhancing maritime security and combating illegal activities at sea, such as piracy and drug trafficking.


The incorrect options are carefully crafted to include plausible but incorrect pairings, testing the candidate's ability to distinguish between the primary focus of different military exercises.  This question requires a nuanced understanding of the complexities and multifaceted nature of these exercises, making it a challenging UPSC-style question.


**4. With reference to India's military contributions, consider the following pairs:**

   Contribution Area                      Specific Detail
1. UN Peacekeeping Forces               :   Lowest contributor of military personnel in 2023
2. Tri-services Commands                :   Only the Strategic Forces Command functions as a tri-service command
3. Inter-Services Organisations (ISOs) :   Composed solely of personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950
4.  Nuclear Weapons Stockpile          :   Managed by the Andaman and Nicobar Command


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) Only three
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)


**Explanation:**

Only one pair is correctly matched:

1. **UN Peacekeeping Forces:** This statement is **incorrect**. The provided text clearly states that India was the **highest**, not the lowest, contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.

2. **Tri-services Commands:** This statement is **incorrect**. The text mentions that both the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command function as tri-services commands.

3. **Inter-Services Organisations (ISOs):** This statement is **incorrect**.  The text states that ISOs include personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957, or any two of these Acts.  It is not limited to personnel under only the Air Force Act.

4. **Nuclear Weapons Stockpile:** This statement is **incorrect**. The text explicitly states that the **Strategic Forces Command**, not the Andaman and Nicobar Command, is in charge of India's nuclear stockpile.


The question tests the candidate's knowledge of various aspects of India's military structure and contributions.  The carefully constructed incorrect options serve as effective distractors, requiring precise factual recall and understanding of the organizational structure of the Indian armed forces.  This makes it a difficult question suitable for a UPSC-style exam.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization              Key Initiative/Feature
1. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)           :   Focuses exclusively on economic cooperation
2. BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :   Operates under the auspices of the United Nations
3.  International Telecommunication Union (ITU)    :   Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only the third pair is correctly matched. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is indeed responsible for releasing the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.  This demonstrates the ITU's role in assessing global cybersecurity commitments.

Option (a) is incorrect. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) is primarily a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues, not exclusively economic cooperation.  While economic factors might be discussed, the ARF's mandate is broader.

Option (b) is incorrect. The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) is a blockchain-based payment system designed to facilitate transactions within the BRICS nations; it does not operate under the auspices of the United Nations.  It's a regional initiative, independent of UN oversight.

Option (d) is incorrect as it combines incorrect pairings with the correct one.  The inaccuracies in options (a) and (b) make this option invalid.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the specific functions and mandates of each organization.


**2. With reference to India's economic partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                     Partner/Organization
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   Focuses on short-range air defense systems
2. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council  :   India has a trade deficit with its partners
3. India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) :   Established a common platform for sharing new ideas and policy recommendations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India, directly addressing the trade relationship.  India does indeed have a trade deficit with ASEAN nations under this agreement. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council is focused on strengthening critical supply chains, a key aspect of its mandate.

Option (c) is incorrect. The India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA) does not establish a common platform for sharing ideas and policy recommendations in the manner described. This is a trade agreement, not a think tank or collaborative forum. The statement misrepresents the agreement's primary objective.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Bloc/Organization              Characteristic
1. BRICS                                   :  Established in 1997
2.  G7                                     : Lacks a permanent structure
3.  SAARC                                  :  Decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (d) because pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. The G7, a group of leading industrialized nations, does not have a permanent secretariat or structure; its presidency rotates annually, setting the agenda.  SAARC's decision-making process mandates unanimity among its member states; this feature has often been cited as a factor in its operational challenges.


Option (a) is incorrect. BRICS, the group comprising Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, was not established in 1997. Its formation occurred later.

Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pairing.

Option (c) is also incorrect for the same reason. The question tests knowledge of the organizational structures and decision-making processes of these important economic blocs.



**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                   Relationship Status with India
1. Singapore                               :   Elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024
2. Vietnam                                 :   Maintains only political dialogues
3. Malaysia                                :   Signed the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2010

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1 and 3 accurately reflect the status of India's relationships with Singapore and Malaysia.  India's relationship with Singapore was indeed upgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024, indicating a high level of cooperation across various domains.  India and Malaysia did sign the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) in 2010, demonstrating a commitment to economic integration.


Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pair.

Option (c) is incorrect because, while the CECA with Malaysia is correct, the description of India-Vietnam relations is inaccurate.  Vietnam and India have a strong strategic partnership, going beyond mere political dialogues.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the inaccurate statement about India-Vietnam relations.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the depth and nature of India's bilateral relationships with specific countries in the region.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Organization                    Primary Goal/Focus
1.  Atoms4Food                               :   Improving global food security using nuclear techniques
2.  Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation    :   Strengthening partnership in space technologies
3.  Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)        :   Exclusively promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The Atoms4Food initiative explicitly uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security, aligning perfectly with its stated goal. The Remote Sensing Satellite Constellation is designed to strengthen partnerships in space technologies, reflecting a focus on collaboration in this sector.


Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair 2.

Option (c) is incorrect because, although pair 2 is correct, pair 3 is not.  The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) is a broader initiative encompassing multiple areas of cooperation between India and several Southeast Asian countries; it doesn't focus solely on nuclear energy for net-zero emissions.

Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair 3.  The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of specific international initiatives and their primary objectives.


**1. With reference to International Organizations and Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Feature
1. BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :  Facilitates payments using SWIFT
2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)                 :   Established in 2005
3. East Asia Summit (EAS)                     :   Includes ASEAN member states, Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US
4.  Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI)       :  Based on a formal treaty among participating nations
5.  International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) : Connects India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay aims to offer an alternative to SWIFT, not to facilitate payments *through* SWIFT.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994, not 2005. Pair 2 is incorrect.  The East Asia Summit (EAS) indeed comprises the members listed in pair 3, making it correct. The Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI) is a non-treaty-based voluntary arrangement, contradicting pair 4. Finally, the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) accurately describes the multi-modal transport network connecting India, Russia, and Europe via Iran and Central Asia as stated in pair 5.  Thus, only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to India's Bilateral and Multilateral Engagements, consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Bloc                                     Agreement/Initiative
1. ASEAN                                          :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
2. European Free Trade Association (EFTA)         :   Is a customs union similar to the EU
3. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)                 :   Is India's smallest trading partner bloc
4.  United States                                  :   India is designated as a Major Defence Partner by the US
5.  Vietnam                                         :   India and Vietnam have an Enhanced Strategic Partnership


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 4 only
(d) 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus, making pair 1 incorrect. EFTA is *not* a customs union; its members maintain individual external tariffs. Pair 2 is incorrect. The GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, not the smallest, thus pair 3 is false. The US did designate India as a Major Defence Partner, making pair 4 correct.  India and Vietnam elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (a higher level than an Enhanced Strategic Partnership), rendering pair 5 incorrect. Therefore, only pair 4 is correctly matched.


**3. With reference to International Organizations and their Activities, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Activity/Focus
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)       :   Primarily focuses on promoting renewable energy sources
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU)    :   Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)        :   Belarus joined as its 9th member in 2024
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                         :  Launched the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
5.  United Nations Security Council               :   The G4 nations hold permanent seats


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2, 4 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's activities encompass nuclear energy and its peaceful applications, not exclusively renewable energy. Pair 1 is incorrect. The ITU did release the GCI 2024, making pair 2 correct. Belarus joined the SCO as its 10th member, not 9th. Pair 3 is incorrect. The G7 indeed launched the PGII, making pair 4 correct. The G4 nations *do not* currently hold permanent seats on the UN Security Council; they are advocating for them. Pair 5 is incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to Regional Cooperation Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Characteristic
1. South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC)  :   Operates on the principle of consensus-based decision-making
2.  BIMSTEC                                         :   Has its secretariat in Colombo, Sri Lanka
3.  Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)                :   Involves India and five Southeast Asian nations
4.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Is primarily focused on enhancing maritime security
5.  BRICS Grain Exchange                             :   Aims to improve food security within the BRICS community


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 3, and 5 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

SAARC does operate on the principle of unanimity for decision-making, making pair 1 correct. BIMSTEC's secretariat is located in Dhaka, Bangladesh, not Colombo, making pair 2 incorrect. The MGC correctly involves India and five ASEAN countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam), making pair 3 correct. IMEC focuses on economic connectivity, not primarily maritime security, making pair 4 incorrect. The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to enhance food security within the BRICS nations, making pair 5 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                      Key Programme/Initiative
1. IAEA                                          :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
2. ITU                                           :   Atoms4Food
3. UNODC                                        :   Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
4. FATF                                          :   Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only pairs 3 and 4 represent accurate matches.  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is known for its Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) which monitors illicit nuclear trafficking and other nuclear safety and security related programs, not the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). The ITU (International Telecommunication Union) focuses on telecommunication standards and related issues, not food security programs like Atoms4Food. Atoms4Food is an IAEA initiative. The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) indeed works on combating transnational organized crime, including through initiatives like the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA).  Finally, the FATF (Financial Action Task Force) plays a crucial role in assessing countries' measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, thus TOCTA is relevant to its work. The other options incorrectly link organizations with initiatives outside their primary mandates, highlighting the importance of careful analysis in matching international organizations with their specific programs.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                      Significant Recent Development
1. Maldives                                     :   Launched RuPay card
2. Mauritius                                   :   First overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra inaugurated
3. India                                        :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) adopted by FATF
4. Russia                                       :   Vetoed UNSC resolution on weapon-free outer space
5.  Philippines                               :  India's Fuel Exports to Europe Shifted from Suez Canal to Cape of Good Hope


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) because pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately reflect recent significant developments. The Maldives saw the launch of the RuPay card, furthering financial cooperation with India.  Mauritius witnessed the inauguration of India's first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra, expanding healthcare access. Russia's veto of the UNSC resolution highlights its stance on the weaponization of space. Option (a) is incorrect because the FATF MER is related to India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures, not a singular development for the country. Option (c) is partially correct but omits the significant development in the Maldives. Option (d) is completely incorrect because the shift of India's fuel exports is associated with the Suez Canal route and not the Philippines.  The question tests factual recall and understanding of recent geopolitical events.


**3. With reference to international organizations and their initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                 Initiative/Activity
1. BIMSTEC                                     :   Operation Crimson Barracuda
2. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)            :   BIMSTEC Charter coming into force
3.  IAEA                                        :  Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action
4.  ITU                                          :   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b).  The IAEA's involvement in managing zoonotic diseases through its integrated action program is accurate.  Similarly, the ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 is a well-documented event. Option (a) is incorrect; Operation Crimson Barracuda was an Indian Navy operation within the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) framework, not a BIMSTEC initiative. Option (c) incorrectly pairs the CMF with the BIMSTEC Charter; the Charter is related to BIMSTEC's internal structure and development. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the erroneous pairings from options (a) and (c). This question tests the candidate's ability to link international organizations with their specific functions and recent activities.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographical Location                         Significant Event/Development
1. Lake Turkana                                  :   First comprehensive survey in 50 years reveals high fish potential
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                             :   Indian national flag unfurled atop Uhuru Summit
3. Lipulekh Pass                               :   Resumption of border trade with Pakistan demanded by Indian traders.
4. Suez Canal                                   :   India’s fuel exports to Europe shifted to Cape of Good Hope route


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (a) because pairs 1, 2, and 4 accurately link geographical locations with recent significant events.  Lake Turkana's survey revealing high fish potential is a factual development. The unfurling of the Indian flag on Mount Kilimanjaro is also accurate. The shift of India's fuel exports from the Suez Canal route due to geopolitical factors is a correct statement. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the significant development at Lake Turkana. Option (c) is partially correct but leaves out the Mount Kilimanjaro event. Option (d) is incorrect because the demand for border trade resumption through Lipulekh Pass is linked with China, not Pakistan. This question tests the ability to associate geographical features with recent events and developments.


**5. With reference to recent geopolitical developments, consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                 Significant Event
1. Russia                                       :   Accused of using chloropicrin in Ukraine
2.  Ukraine                                    :   Launched strikes targeting Kurdish militants in Iraq and Syria
3.  Turkiye                                     :   Breached Swedish airspace near the Baltic Sea
4.  Gulf of Aden                                :   Pirates' attacks raise concern


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (a). The United States' accusation of Russia using chloropicrin in Ukraine is a well-documented event.  Similarly, pirate attacks in the Gulf of Aden remain a persistent concern. Option (b) is incorrect; Turkiye launched strikes, but not in relation to a Swedish airspace breach. Ukraine was not involved in the strikes described. Option (c) is incorrect due to the errors in pairs 2 and 3. Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the valid pair concerning Russia.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent geopolitical events and their accurate association with specific countries or regions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                     Key Feature
1. Geneva Protocol 1925                              : Prohibits the use of biological weapons
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)                : Adopted in 1997, has 193 member states
3. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)              : Bans the development and stockpiling of chemical weapons
4. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Established the International Criminal Court to prosecute genocide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war, not just biological weapons as stated in option 1.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997, making option 2 partially incorrect regarding the adoption year. Option 3 incorrectly attributes the ban on chemical weapons to the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972; this is the purview of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).  The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Focus Area
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)               : Combats proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Monitors illicit nuclear trafficking
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)       :  Focuses primarily on combating money laundering
4. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)     : Releases annual reports on world drug abuse


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's primary focus is combating money laundering and terrorist financing, including the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, making option 1 correct.  The UNODC addresses drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, but its direct involvement in monitoring illicit nuclear trafficking is less prominent than the IAEA's role, making option 2 incorrect.  The IAEA's primary focus is on nuclear energy and safety, including monitoring nuclear material, not primarily money laundering as stated in option 3. The INCB releases annual reports on drug control, making option 4 correct. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                      Key Provision
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 : Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967: Primarily deals with combating terrorist financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000           :  Focuses on regulating the use of nuclear materials
4.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)     :  A UN agency that monitors global drug trafficking


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA, 2002, while not directly establishing the FIU-IND (it was established earlier, in 2004), is central to India's anti-money laundering framework, making option 1 essentially correct in spirit, although not strictly literal.  The UAPA, 1967, is crucial in tackling terrorism and related financing, making option 2 correct. Option 3 incorrectly assigns the regulation of nuclear materials to the Chemical Weapons Convention Act; this is not its primary function. Option 4 correctly identifies the INCB as a UN agency for drug monitoring. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched, considering the nuanced interpretation required for option 1.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                    Key Activity/Focus

(c) 3 only
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

BIMSTEC's focus is broader than just counter-terrorism, encompassing trade, environment, and connectivity, making option 1 incorrect. The Quad's Wilmington Declaration included the 'Quad Cancer Moonshot' initiative, making option 2 correct.  SAARC indeed has a convention on combating trafficking in women and children, making option 3 correct. The CMF's activities extend beyond counter-narcotics to broader maritime security, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)      :  Primarily focuses on military cooperation
3.  Five Eyes Alliance                               :  Involves sharing of intelligence information
4.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)                      :  Is not a specialized agency of the United Nations


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

OPEC+ did indeed extend its oil output cuts, making option 1 correct.  The AIIB focuses on infrastructure development, not military cooperation as stated in option 2. The Five Eyes Alliance is known for its intelligence sharing, making option 3 correct. The UPU is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations, making option 4 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  The questions focus on factual recall, analysis, and evaluation, demanding precise knowledge of the named entities and events.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Conflict Zone                     Primary Factional Opposition
1. Mindanao (Philippines)       :   New People's Army
2. Tigray (Ethiopia)             :   Oromo Liberation Front
3. Sahel Region (Mali)          :   Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb
4. Kachin State (Myanmar)       :   Arakan Army
5. Western Sahara               :   Saharan Arab Democratic Republic


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only the pairs for the Sahel region and Western Sahara accurately reflect the primary opposition factions.  The Sahel region faces opposition primarily from jihadist groups like Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and various ethnic militias.  Similarly, the conflict in Western Sahara is predominantly between Morocco and the Polisario Front.

Option (a) is incorrect because the New People's Army is a significant player in the Philippines but not the *primary* opposition in the Mindanao conflict; the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) holds that position.  Option (c) is incorrect as the Oromo Liberation Front is involved in Ethiopian conflicts, but the Tigray conflict's main opposing force is the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).  The Arakan Army is active in Myanmar, but the primary conflict in Kachin State involves the Kachin Independence Army (KIA). Option (d) combines partially correct and incorrect pairings, making it inaccurate.  The question tests the candidate's detailed understanding of ongoing conflicts, going beyond commonly known names to assess their grasp of specific actors.


**2. With reference to ongoing conflicts, consider the following pairs:**

Conflict Zone                      Underlying Cause
1.  Nagorno-Karabakh Region     :   Resource control over oil fields
2.  Transnistria (Moldova)       :   Desire for reunification with Russia
3.  Basque Country (Spain)       :   Religious differences between Catholics and Protestants
4.  Chechnya (Russia)            :   Secessionist movement and ethnic nationalism
5.  Cyprus (Greek-Turkish Divide) :   Border disputes over agricultural land


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because the underlying causes of the conflicts in Transnistria and Chechnya are accurately described. Transnistria's conflict stems from a declaration of independence and a desire to maintain ties with Russia, while Chechnya's conflict is driven by a strong secessionist movement and ethnic nationalism.

Option (a) is incorrect; Nagorno-Karabakh's conflict is primarily rooted in ethno-territorial disputes, not resource control over oil fields. Option (b) is incorrect because Cyprus's division is primarily based on ethnic and political differences, not border disputes over land.  Option (d) is incorrect because the Basque conflict is primarily about independence and self-determination, not religious differences. This question tests the candidate's ability to analyze the root causes of conflicts, differentiating between superficial and deeper reasons.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b). Only OPEC+ is accurately paired with its key initiative: deep oil output cuts.  The other options incorrectly link organizations with initiatives they are not associated with.  The IAEA focuses on nuclear safety and security, the ITU on telecommunications, the FATF on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, and the Arab League on matters related to Arab states.  This question tests knowledge of international organizations and their specific mandates, requiring precise recall of their activities.


**4. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

3. Abu Musa Island                :   Nord Stream pipeline damage
4. Senkaku Islands                :   Dispute over sovereignty
5. Mauritius                       :   Russian peacekeeper withdrawal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 5 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only the pairs for Somalia (suicide bombing) and Senkaku Islands (sovereignty dispute) are correctly matched. The other pairings incorrectly link locations with events.  This question tests the candidate's awareness of current events and their geographical context.


These questions are designed to be challenging, requiring precise knowledge and careful analysis to avoid the plausible distractors. They assess a deeper understanding of the topics than simple factual recall.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization              Specific Initiative/Program
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)    :   Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Global Firearms Programme (GFP)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 2, 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed involved in the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, although the portal's creation and implementation are a collaborative effort, not solely FATF's.  The UNODC's role in the Global Firearms Programme (GFP) is central to its mandate of combating transnational crime. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative is directly related to its focus on nuclear energy and climate change mitigation. Finally, the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) is responsible for publishing the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI).  All four pairs accurately link the international organization to a specific initiative or program under its purview.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  The comprehensive nature of option (c) accurately reflects the established connections between each organization and its named program.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                   Significant Bilateral Initiative with India

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's engagement with its neighboring countries involves various initiatives.  The Maldives receives grant assistance from India for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs). India and Bhutan are collaborating on the development of an India-Bhutan SAT. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint initiative between India and Bangladesh.  Finally, Arun III is a hydropower project developed with Indian collaboration. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of India's foreign policy and its relationships with its immediate neighbors.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention/Treaty                 Key Feature/Objective
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Combats terrorist financing
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)     :   Prohibits the use of chemical weapons in conflict
3. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 :   Has India as a ratifying state
4. Geneva Protocol 1925                  :   Bans development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, addresses money laundering, which is intrinsically linked to terrorist financing. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) explicitly prohibits the use of chemical weapons in armed conflict, as well as their development, production, stockpiling, and transfer. India is indeed a ratifying state of the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000.  However, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the *use* of chemical and biological weapons in war, but doesn't cover other aspects like production or stockpiling that the CWC does. Therefore, pair 4 is incorrectly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 4 or exclude correctly matched pairs. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct matches.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Region/Area                                     Significant Drug Issue
1. Golden Triangle (Death Triangle)           :   Cannabis is the most abused drug
2. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :  High prevalence of Amphetamines
3. Golden Crescent (Death Crescent)             :   Afghanistan is a key opium producer


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Golden Triangle, now often referred to as the Death Triangle, is a region historically notorious for opium production, though cannabis is also prevalent. The Triple Frontier Area, due to its porous borders, has a significant problem with various drugs, including amphetamines.  The Golden Crescent, renamed the Death Crescent, with Afghanistan at its center, is a major source of opium and heroin production. While the specific most abused drug may vary within each region, the overall description of drug issues in each region is accurate.  All three pairs highlight significant aspects of drug trafficking in these regions; therefore, option (d) is correct.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to encompass the accurate pairings.  The question tests knowledge of global drug trafficking patterns and geopolitical hotspots.

2.  G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI)  :   Combating Climate Change
3.  "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative     :   Clean energy access in Africa
4.  Apulia Food Systems                         :   Sustainable Agriculture


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is explicitly focused on sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) directly addresses ocean conservation and sustainability, inherently linked to climate change mitigation. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative aims to improve access to clean energy sources across the African continent.  Apulia Food Systems promotes sustainable agricultural practices.  Therefore, all four pairs correctly match the initiative or organization with its primary focus area. Option (c) is the correct answer as it includes all four correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one of the correctly matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of complete understanding of these global initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Region Associated with Drug Abuse                     Primary Drug
1. Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay) :  Cannabis
2. Golden Triangle (Laos, Myanmar, Thailand)          :  Opioids
3. Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iran)       :  Cocaine

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Triple Frontier Area, situated where Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is notorious for drug trafficking, with cannabis being a prominent drug in this region. The Golden Triangle, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, is historically linked to the production and trafficking of opium and its derivatives, including heroin. The Golden Crescent, comprising Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, is recognized as a major source of opium, heroin, and other opioids.  Therefore, only the first pair is correctly matched. While all three regions are involved in significant drug trafficking, the primary drugs associated with them are not uniformly represented in options 2 and 3.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the geographical distribution of major drug production and trafficking hubs, a critical aspect of international security and transnational organized crime.  Understanding the specific drugs dominating each region is vital for effective counter-narcotics strategies.  Options (b), (c), and (d) include incorrect pairings, highlighting the need for precise knowledge and the potential for confusion due to the overlapping nature of drug trafficking routes and the varied drug profiles in each region.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization                                  Initiative/Program

2. IAEA                                                        TOCTA
3. FATF                                                        Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization focused on combating money laundering and terrorist financing. A core part of its work involves conducting Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) to assess member countries' compliance with international standards. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) deals with drugs, crime, and terrorism, but Atoms4Food is a program under the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), which focuses on nuclear applications for improving food security.  The Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) is an initiative of the UNODC.  Therefore, only the pair relating FATF and MER is correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's understanding of the mandates and activities of various international organizations, requiring knowledge beyond just the names and encompassing their specific programs and initiatives.  The distractors (incorrect pairings) highlight the need for detailed knowledge of international organizations and their roles in global governance, particularly in areas like financial crime, nuclear security, and drug control.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                                   Significant Feature
1. Maldives                                                Longest National Coastline
2. Australia                                                Composed of Natural Atolls
3. United Kingdom                                          Mississippi River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Maldives is an archipelago composed of natural atolls. Australia possesses the longest national coastline globally, and the Mississippi River is located in the United States.  None of the pairs provided are correctly matched. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of geographical features associated with specific countries, requiring precise recall of facts and an understanding of distinguishing characteristics. The distractors are carefully chosen to be plausible but incorrect, highlighting the need for accurate information and the potential for confusing similar geographical features across countries.  This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between countries based on their unique geographical attributes.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Agreement                                    Focus
1. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)                    Combating Money Laundering
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)                     Prohibiting the Development and Use of Biological Weapons
3. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC)      Establishing the International Criminal Court


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (1972) prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons. The Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons. The Rome Statute (1998) established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. Combating money laundering is not the focus of the Biological Weapons Convention. This question tests the candidate's understanding of international treaties and their core objectives.  The incorrect options highlight the need for precision in identifying the specific mandates of international agreements and the potential for confusion among related treaties focusing on different aspects of international law and security.  The correct answer emphasizes the need for understanding the specific focus of each agreement.


**5. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                         Specific Initiative/Agreement
1. Maldives                                      Operation Neer
2. Australia                                     Technology Security Initiative (TSI)
3. United Kingdom                                 Mutual Logistics Support Arrangement (MLSA)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Operation Neer was a water assistance initiative undertaken by India for the Maldives during a water crisis.  The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) is a collaboration between India and the UK. The Mutual Logistics Support Arrangement (MLSA) is a defense agreement between India and Australia.  Only the pairing of Maldives and Operation Neer is correct.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of specific initiatives and agreements within India's bilateral relations.  The incorrect pairings act as distractors, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the details of various bilateral collaborations and the potential for confusion among similar agreements with different countries.  The focus is on the ability to link specific countries with particular initiatives.



**1. With reference to International Economic Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure in developing nations.
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative     :  A G7-led effort focusing on external investment for renewable energy projects in Africa.
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) :  Concerned with sustainable agriculture and food security enhancement.
4. Apulia Food Systems Initiative              :  Focused on promoting sustainable marine resources and ocean health.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is accurately described in pair 1; its aim is to mobilize significant funding for sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries by 2027.  Pair 2 correctly identifies the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative as a G7-led effort to attract external investment for clean energy projects on the African continent. Pair 4 is also correct; the Apulia Food Systems initiative focuses on improving food security and sustainable agriculture.  However, pair 3 is incorrectly matched. While the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is a genuine G7 initiative, its focus is on marine sustainability and ocean health, not sustainable agriculture and food security.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.


**2. With reference to International Organizations and their Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                   Initiative/Report
1. UNESCAP                                    : World Investment Report
2. UNCTAD                                     : Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific
3. UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) : Manifesto for Intermodal, Low-Carbon, Efficient, and Resilient Freight Transport and Logistics
4.  IAEA                                      : Global Cybersecurity Index


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. The UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) did indeed launch the Manifesto for Intermodal, Low-Carbon, Efficient, and Resilient Freight Transport and Logistics.  The other pairings are incorrect. The *World Investment Report* is published by UNCTAD, not UNESCAP (pair 1). The *Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific* is a publication of UNESCAP, not UNCTAD (pair 2). The Global Cybersecurity Index is produced by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not the IAEA (pair 4). Therefore, only pair 3 represents a correct matching.


**3. With reference to the India's participation in International Forums, consider the following pairs:**

Forum/Agreement                                     Key Aspect
1. IPEF's Supply Chain Council                       : India elected as Chair
2. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
3. East Asia Summit (EAS)                             :  Comprises 18 members, including ASEAN, Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US.
4. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :  Aimed at enhancing connectivity between the Middle East and Europe


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; India was elected *Vice-Chair*, not Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council. Pair 2 is incorrect; India has a *trade deficit*, not surplus, with ASEAN. Pair 3 is correct; the EAS membership accurately reflects the given composition.  Pair 4 is also correct; IMEC is indeed aimed at strengthening connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.



**4. With reference to the BRICS and its Initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                       Key Characteristic
1. New Development Bank (NDB)                : Headquarters in Fortaleza, Brazil.
2. BRICS Grain Exchange                         :  Focuses on creating a fair trading system for agricultural products within the BRICS community.
3. BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :  A blockchain-based payment system offering an alternative to SWIFT.
4. Contingent Reserve Arrangement             :  Provides short-term liquidity support to member nations facing balance of payment issues.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2, 3, and 4 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; the NDB's headquarters are in Shanghai, China, not Fortaleza, Brazil. Pairs 2, 3, and 4 are all correctly matched. The BRICS Grain Exchange aims to improve agricultural trade within the BRICS framework. The BCBPI is a blockchain-based payment system designed as an alternative to SWIFT.  The Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides crucial short-term financial assistance to BRICS nations facing balance of payment challenges. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to International Agreements and Conventions, consider the following pairs:**

Agreement/Convention                            Key Feature/Objective
1. Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)           :  India is not a signatory to this convention.
2. Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of FATF     :  Assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
3.  ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation               : Includes ASEAN member states, China, Japan, and South Korea but excludes India.
4.  India-Singapore Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) : Aims to reduce trade barriers between India and Singapore


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 4 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Pair 1 is incorrect; India *is* a signatory to the CWC. Pair 3 is incorrect; India is an active participant in ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation. Pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched. The MER by the FATF assesses countries' efforts to combat various financial crimes. The India-Singapore CECA aims to facilitate trade between the two countries by reducing barriers.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 4 are correctly matched.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                     Key Feature
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure in developing nations.
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative       : Led by the G7 to facilitate clean energy investment in Africa.
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Focuses on sustainable agriculture and food security.
4. G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition                   :  A G7 initiative unrelated to infrastructure development.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) was indeed launched to mobilize significant funding for infrastructure projects in developing countries, aiming for up to $600 billion by 2027.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is accurately described as a G7-led effort designed to attract external investment for clean energy projects on the African continent. Option 3 is incorrect because the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) does not primarily focus on sustainable agriculture and food security; its focus is on ocean health and sustainability. Option 4 is a distractor; while the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition is a real initiative, it's not directly related to infrastructure development, unlike the PGII.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. The question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar-sounding initiatives with different focuses.  It also requires the candidate to differentiate between accurate and inaccurate descriptions of international development initiatives.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Activity
1.  The Commonwealth                           :  Established the Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund.
2.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)     :  Includes a Crisis Response Network to manage supply chain disruptions.
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)       :  Adopted a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism for 2025-2027.
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                         :  Has a permanent structure with a rotating presidency setting the agenda annually.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth is correctly paired with its establishment of the Commonwealth Sub Window. The IPEF accurately includes a Crisis Response Network as part of its supply chain initiatives. The SCO correctly adopted the mentioned counter-terrorism cooperation program. However, the G7 does *not* have a permanent structure; its rotating presidency is a key feature, making option 4 incorrect.  This question assesses factual recall of international organizations and their activities. It tests the candidate's ability to identify accurate descriptions of organizational functions and differentiate between the organizational structures of different international bodies.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement about the G7's structure serves as a significant distractor, demanding careful consideration of each pair.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Body                           Report/Initiative
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)          : Released the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India in 2024.
2.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Published the World Wildlife Crime Report 2024.
3. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)     : Released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024.
4. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) :  Operates the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) for nuclear material.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's role in releasing the MER for India is accurate. The UNODC's publication of the World Wildlife Crime Report is also correct. However, the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 was released by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), not the IAEA, making option 3 incorrect.  Similarly, the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) is operated by the IAEA, not the ITU, making option 4 incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their specific reports and activities.  It requires precise recall of the functions of these bodies and the ability to differentiate between their areas of expertise. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect pairings adds difficulty, ensuring that superficial knowledge is insufficient to answer correctly. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to distinguish between similar international organizations.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                   Significant Economic Initiative/Feature
1.  India                                          :  Elected Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2.  ASEAN                                         :  Signed the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) in 2009.
3.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)                :  Adopted a Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 with India at their Joint Ministerial Meeting.
4.  United States (US)                            :  Enacted the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) in 2017.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. India's role in the IPEF's Supply Chain Council, the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), the India-GCC Joint Action Plan, and the US enactment of CAATSA are all accurately described.  This question assesses factual recall of significant economic initiatives and features related to various countries and regional organizations.  It tests the candidate's ability to associate specific countries with their involvement in international economic agreements and legislation.  The inclusion of all correct pairings makes this question challenging because it requires comprehensive knowledge of the subject matter.  No distractors are present, making accurate recall essential for a correct response. The question assesses factual recall and the ability to link countries to their respective economic initiatives.



**1. Consider the following pairs:**

International Treaty/Convention             Year of Adoption/Entry into Force
1.  Geneva Conventions                      :   1977
2.  Biological Weapons Convention           :   1997
3.  Chemical Weapons Convention            :   1992
4.  Rome Statute for the ICC                :   2002


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 and 4 only because the Chemical Weapons Convention was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997, and the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court was adopted in 1998 and entered into force in 2002.  Option 1 is incorrect because the Geneva Conventions were adopted in 1949, not 1977; the Additional Protocols were adopted in 1977. Option 2 is incorrect as the Biological Weapons Convention was adopted in 1972.  Understanding the timelines of these crucial international agreements is vital for a comprehensive understanding of international law and global security. The question tests factual recall and understanding of the evolution of international legal frameworks concerning warfare and human rights.  The distractors (incorrect years) are designed to test the candidate’s precise knowledge and ability to differentiate between similar-sounding treaties.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

International Organization/Initiative       Focus Area
1.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)          :   Combating money laundering
2.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Infrastructure development in emerging economies
3.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)     :   Postal services


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is indeed focused on infrastructure development in emerging economies.  Option 1 is incorrect; the UPU's focus is on postal services, not combating money laundering. That is the domain of the FATF. Option 3 is also incorrect; the FATF assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The question tests the candidate’s knowledge of various international organizations and their mandates.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring precise knowledge of each organization’s primary function. This question assesses factual recall and understanding of the roles of international financial and infrastructural institutions.


**3. With reference to international cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative/Organization                     Key Characteristic/Activity
1.  BIMSTEC                               :   Focuses solely on disaster management
2.  QUAD                                   :   Includes a partnership to combat cervical cancer
3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)       :   Exclusively involves naval exercises in the Pacific Ocean


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (b) 2 only. The QUAD initiative does indeed include a partnership to combat cervical cancer, as part of its broader focus on health cooperation. Option 1 is incorrect; BIMSTEC has a wider mandate than just disaster management, encompassing trade, environment, security, and other areas.  Option 3 is incorrect as the CMF conducts multinational maritime operations across various regions, not exclusively the Pacific Ocean. The question assesses the candidate’s understanding of regional and multilateral cooperation initiatives and their diverse objectives. The distractors highlight the multifaceted nature of these initiatives, requiring candidates to possess precise knowledge rather than relying on general assumptions. This question tests factual recall and analytical skills in differentiating between the various initiatives.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

International Agency/Treaty                Action/Focus
1.  IAEA                                  :   Focuses solely on nuclear energy
2.  UNODC                                 :   Publishes reports on wildlife crime
3.  INCB                                  :   Regulates the use of chemical weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) 2 only. The UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime) does indeed publish reports on wildlife crime, as part of its broader mandate on transnational organized crime.  Option 1 is incorrect; the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) has a broader mandate than just nuclear energy, including nuclear safety, security, and applications in other fields like medicine and agriculture. Option 3 is incorrect; the INCB (International Narcotics Control Board) monitors international drug control, not chemical weapons regulation (that's the CWC).  The question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of international agencies and their specific functions. The inclusion of plausible distractors requires candidates to have a detailed understanding of each agency's role. This question tests factual recall and the ability to distinguish between closely related organizations.


**5. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following pairs:**

Action/Event                                  Year
1.  ICC issued an arrest warrant against Russia’s President:   2024
2.  ICC Prosecutor sought arrest warrants for Israel’s PM and Hamas leaders:   2023
3.  The Rome Statute for the ICC was adopted:              1998


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) 3 only. The Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court was indeed adopted in 1998. Option 1 is incorrect; the ICC issued an arrest warrant against Russia's President in March 2023, not 2024.  Option 2 is incorrect; while the ICC Prosecutor did seek arrest warrants for Israel's PM and Hamas leaders, the timeframe provided is inaccurate.  The question tests factual recall and chronology concerning the ICC and its actions. The incorrect years in options 1 and 2 serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate’s precise knowledge of the timeline of events.  This question assesses factual recall and an understanding of the ICC's jurisdiction and actions.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country          | Major Trade Partner (in specified region)
1. Bangladesh     | India (South Asia)
2. India           | China (Asia)
3. Maldives       | Sri Lanka (South Asia)
4. Bhutan         | India (South Asia)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, making pair 1 correct.  Bhutan's primary trading partner is also India, making pair 4 correct. However, while India engages in significant trade with China, it's not the *major* trade partner for India in Asia; this position is usually held by other countries such as the US or the EU depending on the year.  Therefore, pair 2 is incorrect.  The Maldives' major trading partners are typically countries like India, China, and the UAE, not Sri Lanka, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question tests factual recall of major trade relationships in South Asia and broader Asian trade contexts.  Distractors are included by providing plausible, but ultimately incorrect, major trade partner relationships to challenge the examinee's understanding of precise economic ties between nations.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country       | Significant Bilateral Initiative/Agreement
1. Maldives     | Operation Neer (water assistance)
2. Bhutan       | Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
3. Bangladesh   |  Currency Swap Agreement
4. Nepal         |  Arun III Hydropower Project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India's Operation Neer provided crucial water assistance to the Maldives during a crisis, thus making pair 1 correct.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint India-Bangladesh initiative, not India-Bhutan, making pair 2 incorrect.  The Currency Swap Agreement is a significant initiative between India and the Maldives, not India and Bangladesh, making pair 3 incorrect. India's involvement in the Arun III Hydropower Project in Nepal makes pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The question assesses the candidate's understanding of specific bilateral initiatives, testing factual knowledge and the ability to differentiate between similar-sounding projects and countries involved.

(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 3, and 5 only
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.  The AIIB's focus on assisting low-income countries is accurate.  The 2024 Arab League Summit was indeed held in Bahrain.  The DiGi Framework is correctly identified as an initiative involving the U.S., Japan, and South Korea. The QUAD partnership accurately includes the four nations mentioned.  However, pair 4 is incorrect; while India and Japan do cooperate on clean energy, the CEP does not specifically focus on peaceful nuclear energy; that is a separate agreement. Therefore, only 1, 2, 3, and 5 are correctly matched.


**5. With reference to conflict zones and geopolitical areas, consider the following pairs:**

   Location                            Description/Significance
1.  Nagorno-Karabakh Region          :  Officially part of Azerbaijan, disputed territory
2.  Snake Island (Zmiinyi Island), Ukraine :  Attacked by Russian missiles
3.  Nord Stream Pipelines              :  Damaged by explosions, resulting in methane release into the Baltic Sea
4.  Kursk Region, Russia               :  Bordering Ukraine, declared an emergency
5.  Abu Musa Island                     : Disputed between Iran and UAE


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(c) 2, 3, and 5 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect the descriptions and significance of the locations mentioned. Nagorno-Karabakh's status as a disputed territory within Azerbaijan is well-documented.  The Russian missile attacks on Snake Island in Ukraine are a matter of public record.  The Nord Stream pipeline explosions and subsequent methane release into the Baltic Sea are widely reported events.  The declaration of an emergency in Russia's Kursk region bordering Ukraine is also a verifiable fact. Finally, the territorial dispute over Abu Musa Island between Iran and the UAE is a long-standing geopolitical issue.  Thus, all pairs (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                    Key Feature/Initiative
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)                     :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for combating money laundering
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)     :   Annual Report on World Drug Day
3.  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) :   Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                                  :  Energy for Growth in Africa initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), which assess countries' efforts in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The UNODC publishes an annual report in conjunction with World Drug Day, highlighting global drug trends and challenges. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) has a stated goal of mobilizing significant funding for infrastructure projects in developing nations. Finally, the G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative directly aligns with the G7's broader focus on global development and energy security.  All four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Legislation                                       Core Objective/Provision
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002     :   Combats proliferation of weapons of mass destruction
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967  :   Addresses terrorist financing
3. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000              :   Prohibits development and use of chemical weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA primarily focuses on preventing money laundering, not directly on weapons proliferation. While UAPA tackles unlawful activities, including those related to terrorism, making its connection to terrorist financing accurate. The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is a direct implementation of the international Chemical Weapons Convention, aiming to prohibit the development, production, and use of chemical weapons.  Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention                  Key Provision/Focus
1.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000  :  Combats drug trafficking
2.  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002  :  Addresses human trafficking within South Asia
3.  1972 Biological Weapons Convention                  :   Prohibits development and stockpiling of biological weapons
4.  1993 Chemical Weapons Convention                  :   Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While UNTOC addresses transnational organized crime broadly, it's not solely focused on drug trafficking; it covers a wider range of criminal activities. The SAARC Convention specifically targets trafficking in women and children for prostitution within the South Asian region. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention accurately reflect their respective prohibitions on the development and use of biological and chemical weapons. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes pair 1 which is partially correct. Option (c) is incorrect as it misses pair 2. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes pair 1 which is only partially correct.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Institution/Organization                             Role/Function
1.  Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)       :   Established in 1956
2.  Directorate of Enforcement (ED)                   :   Established in 2004
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)        :   India's Jagjit Pavadia re-elected for a third term (2025-2030)
4.  Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI):  Published the World Military Expenditure, 2023 Report

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956; the ED was established in 1956, not 2004.  The INCB's re-election of Jagjit Pavadia is accurate.  SIPRI's publication of the World Military Expenditure report is also accurate.  Thus only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they contain at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative                    Key Characteristic/Outcome
1.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)           :   Belarus joined as the 9th member in 2024
2.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)     :    ASEAN Future Forum, proposed by Vietnam
3.  Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) :  Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force
4.  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) :   RBI announces SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Belarus joined the SCO as the 10th member, not the 9th.  The ASEAN Future Forum's proposal by Vietnam and BIMSTEC's acquisition of legal personality are accurate.  The RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework is also correct. Therefore, only pairs 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because it includes pair 1 which is incorrect. Option (c) is incorrect because it misses pairs 2 and 3. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes pair 1 which is incorrect.


**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative/Agreement                      Key Partner/Feature
1.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Agreement   :   India elected as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council
2.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)     :   A cornerstone of global connectivity
3.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)       :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
4.  Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)               :   Wilmington Declaration adopted at the Quad Leaders' Summit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India's election as Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council, IMEC's role in global connectivity, and the adoption of the Wilmington Declaration at the Quad Leaders' Summit are all accurate. However, India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus, making pair 3 incorrect. Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 4 are correctly matched.  Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either include the incorrectly matched pair 3 or exclude correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise                      Participating Countries
1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas                 :   India and the United States
2. Exercise Malabar                      :   India, Australia, Japan, and the United States
3. Exercise Indra                          :   India and Russia
4. Exercise Nomadic Elephant             :   India and Mongolia
5. Exercise Surya Kiran                    :    India and Nepal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs listed are correctly matched.  Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise between India and the United States.  Exercise Malabar is a significant multinational naval exercise involving India, Australia, Japan, and the United States. Exercise Indra is a bilateral military exercise between India and Russia.  Exercise Nomadic Elephant is a joint military exercise between India and Mongolia. Finally, Exercise Surya Kiran is an annual joint military exercise conducted alternately between India and Nepal.  There are no incorrect pairings in the provided list.  The question tests factual recall of military exercises and their participating countries, demonstrating a basic understanding of India's defense engagements.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                          Key Function/Activity
1. SIPRI                                 :   Publishes the annual World Military Expenditure report
2. FATF                                  :   Assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering
3. UNODC                                :   Focuses on countering transnational organized crime
4. UNCCD                                :   Aims to achieve land degradation neutrality
5. INCB                                  :  Monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) is renowned for its annual reports on military expenditure. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) plays a crucial role in assessing and combating money laundering and terrorist financing. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is actively involved in countering transnational organized crime. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) focuses on land degradation neutrality. Finally, the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) monitors the implementation of international drug control treaties. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various international organizations and their mandates, highlighting an understanding of global governance and security issues.


**3. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                           Headquarters Location
1. African Union (AU)                   :   Nairobi, Kenya
2. North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) :   Brussels, Belgium
3. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Beijing, China
4. Universal Postal Union (UPU)         :   Bern, Switzerland
5. OPEC+                                 :   Vienna, Austria


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Options 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. NATO's headquarters is in Brussels, Belgium; AIIB's headquarters is in Beijing, China; and UPU's headquarters is in Bern, Switzerland.  However, the African Union (AU) headquarters is located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, not Nairobi, Kenya, making option 1 incorrect. OPEC+, while often meeting in Vienna, Austria, does not have a formal headquarters in the same way that the other organizations listed do. This makes option 5 incorrect. The question tests knowledge of the locations of international organization headquarters, requiring precise factual recall and demonstrating familiarity with global governance structures.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Operation                      Primary Objective/Context
1. Operation Vijay                       :   Eviction of Pakistani forces from Kargil
2. Operation Safed Sagar                 :   Targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions during Kargil War
3. Operation Talwar                      :   Naval blockade of Pakistan during the Kargil War
4. Operation Sadbhav                     :   Humanitarian assistance to Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam
5. Operation Southern Readiness           :   Multinational maritime exercise


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Options 1, 2, 3, and 4 are correctly matched. Operation Vijay was the Indian Army's operation to evict Pakistani forces from the Kargil region. Operation Safed Sagar involved the Indian Air Force targeting Pakistani positions in the Kargil conflict. Operation Talwar was the Indian Navy's naval blockade during the Kargil War. Operation Sadbhav refers to India's humanitarian assistance operation in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. However, Operation Southern Readiness is a multinational maritime exercise, not a specific military operation with a single objective, making option 5 incorrect. This question tests factual knowledge of Indian military operations, requiring the candidate to differentiate between military operations and exercises while demonstrating an understanding of India's foreign policy and military strategies.


**5. With reference to India's defense partnerships, consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement                             Key Feature
1. LEMOA                               :   Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement
2. COMCASA                             :   Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement
3. BECA                                 :   Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement
4. SOSA                                 :   Security of Supply Agreement
5. CAATSA                               :   Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2, 3, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  LEMOA, COMCASA, and BECA are all defense agreements between India and the United States. SOSA (Security of Supply Agreement) is also a relevant defense agreement.  CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) is a US law that can impact relations with other nations, including sanctions. The question assesses the candidate's understanding of key defense agreements and their significance in India's foreign policy, demonstrating knowledge of strategic partnerships and potential challenges.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                  Key Initiative/Program
1. International Energy Agency (IEA)         :    Atoms4NetZero
2. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :    Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
3. Group of Seven (G7)                     :    Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB)
4.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)  :    Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d) because only pair 4 accurately links the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) with one of its key initiatives: the Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism.  The SCO's focus on regional security and counter-terrorism is well-documented.

Option (a) is incorrect because Atoms4NetZero is a program of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), not the IEA.  The IEA's work centers on energy security and policy.  Option (b) is incorrect as the PGII is an initiative of the G7, aimed at funding infrastructure projects in developing countries.  The IAEA's focus is on nuclear energy and its peaceful applications. Option (c) is incorrect; the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) is a key program under the IAEA's mandate to monitor and prevent illicit nuclear trafficking.  The G7 is a group of leading industrialized nations primarily focused on economic and political cooperation. The distractors are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the specific mandates and activities of each organization, highlighting the need for precise understanding rather than general familiarity.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Significant International Agreement/Initiative
1.  India                                    :    Member of the Five Eyes Alliance
2.  Sweden                                  :    Member of the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)
3.  Belarus                                 :   Member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)
4.  Australia                               :   Signatory to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Option (d) is correct. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO is a significant development in international relations.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention is a widely ratified treaty, and Australia, as a member of the international community, is indeed a signatory.

Option (a) is incorrect; India is not a member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance.  Options (b) and (c) are incorrect because Sweden is not a member of the CMF, and while the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention is a global agreement, the question tests knowledge of specific country memberships, requiring precise factual recall.  The distractors highlight the importance of knowing specific memberships and treaty signatories and not relying on general knowledge of a nation's international involvement.


**3.  With reference to international economic cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Grouping/Initiative              Key Feature/Outcome
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)  :   Establishment of the  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
2.  BIMSTEC                               :    The BIMSTEC Charter coming into force
3.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :  The ‘Quad Cancer Moonshot’ partnership
4.  Group of Seven (G7)                    :   Launch of the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 correctly matches BIMSTEC with a key event—the entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter, a significant step in strengthening the organization's framework.

Option (a) is incorrect; the IMEC is a separate initiative related to connectivity, not a direct outcome of IPEF. Option (c) is incorrect; the AIIB focuses on infrastructure financing in Asia, while the ‘Quad Cancer Moonshot’ is a collaborative initiative of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad). Option (d) is incorrect; the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) is a BRICS initiative, not related to the G7. The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of specific international economic initiatives and their key features.  The question demands precise knowledge of the activities and outcomes of different economic groupings and avoids generalizations.


**4. With reference to regional security cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative           Key Activity/Development
1. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)          :   Operation Crimson Barracuda
2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)             :   The ‘Quad Ports of the Future Partnership’
3.  Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad)   :   ASEAN Future Forum
4.  North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) :   Sweden joining as a member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 1 and 4 are correctly matched.  The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda under the CMF is accurate. Sweden's recent accession to NATO is also a well-known fact.

Option (a) is incomplete. Options (c) and (d) are incorrect because the ‘Quad Ports of the Future Partnership’ is a Quad initiative, and the ASEAN Future Forum is an ASEAN-led initiative, not related to the ARF or the Quad.  The distractors test the candidate's understanding of the operational activities and recent developments within specific regional security frameworks.  The question demands specific knowledge of military operations and organizational memberships, not general knowledge of regional security dynamics.


**5. With reference to India's international relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                          Key Aspect of Cooperation/Engagement
1.  Bangladesh                             :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
2.  Iran                                   :   Development of Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar Port
3.  Malaysia                               :   Exercise Harimau Shakti
4.  Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries :   India-GCC Political Dialogue


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant represents energy cooperation between India and Bangladesh. The Chabahar Port development highlights India's engagement with Iran. Exercise Harimau Shakti reflects the defense cooperation between India and Malaysia. The India-GCC Political Dialogue showcases India's diplomatic ties with the GCC countries.

All options other than (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various aspects of India's bilateral relations with different countries and regions, demanding comprehensive understanding.  The question avoids overly general statements and focuses on specific projects and initiatives.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                      Key Feature/Initiative
1. BIMSTEC                                         :   Master Plan for Transport Connectivity
2. QUAD                                            :   Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)
3. India-Bangladesh Relations                       :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
4. India-US Relations                              :   Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA)
5. BRICS                                           :   BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs provided are correctly matched.  BIMSTEC (Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation) indeed has a Master Plan for Transport Connectivity as one of its major projects aimed at improving regional infrastructure and trade.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) accurately aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties between ASEAN and India.  A Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) correctly serves to stabilize exchange rates and enhance liquidity between participating countries. Project Nexus is accurately described as an initiative to connect India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) with Fast Payment Systems (FPSs) of other nations. Finally, the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) correctly exists between India and Singapore. Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer as it includes all correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, missing at least one correctly matched pair.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2, SALVEX (India-US Naval exercise), is correctly matched.  Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise between India and the USA, not Russia.  Vajra Prahar is a joint India-US army exercise, not with the UK. Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the US, not France. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and France, not Australia.  The other options incorrectly pair the exercises with nations. The question tests factual recall of specific military exercises and their participating countries.  The distractors are designed to be plausible, requiring precise knowledge of Indo-US and Indo-French defense collaborations to answer correctly. The incorrect options present countries that do engage in military exercises with India, but not in the context of the specific exercises listed.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Multilateral Exercise            Type of Exercise
1. IBSAMAR VIII                      : Air Exercise

5. Exercise Orion                      : Land Exercise

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2, RIMPAC (world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise), is correctly matched. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise, not an air exercise. Exercise Pitch Black is a multinational air exercise, not a maritime exercise. Exercise Cutlass Express is a multinational maritime exercise, not an air exercise. Exercise Orion is a multinational maritime exercise, not a land exercise.  The incorrect options demonstrate the need for precise knowledge of the nature of each multilateral exercise.  The distractors utilize similar exercise types to confuse the examinee. The question tests the understanding of different types of multilateral military exercises and their classification.  It demands precise knowledge, not just general familiarity with international military cooperation.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative/Project                      Country Focus

(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 2 and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched.  Operation Sadbhav focuses on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief in Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, not Nepal and Bhutan. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline connects India and Bangladesh, not Bangladesh and Myanmar. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is indeed in the Maldives. The TAPI pipeline correctly connects Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. Operation Neer provided water assistance to Maldives during a crisis, not Sri Lanka.  The incorrect options highlight the importance of precise knowledge of geographical scope and target countries for each initiative. The question tests understanding of specific development projects and their geographical reach, requiring detailed factual recall.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                              Key Feature

4. India                                 : Great Barrier Reef
5. Kenya                                :  Omo River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched.  The Maldives is composed of natural atolls, not Australia.  Australia has the longest national coastline, not the Maldives. The United Kingdom does indeed include the Pennines mountain range. India does not have the Great Barrier Reef; it's located off the coast of Australia. Kenya is where the Omo River is located. The incorrect options demonstrate the need for precise knowledge of geographical features associated with each country. The question tests knowledge of key geographical features of different countries, demanding accurate factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar geographical characteristics.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Summit             Key characteristic/Participant
1. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)     : Established in 2005
2. East Asia Summit (EAS)         : India joined in 1996
3. BRICS Cross-Border Payments:   Blockchain-based payment service
4. Colombo Process                 :  Bangladesh is a founding member
5. MERCOSUR                        : Bolivia became a full member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 5 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 3 and 5 are correctly matched. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994, not 2005. India joined the ARF in 1996, not the EAS. The East Asia Summit (EAS) was established in 2005, not the ARF. The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative is indeed a blockchain-based payment service. The Colombo Process does not include Bangladesh as a founding member.  Bolivia recently became a full member of MERCOSUR. The incorrect options highlight the importance of knowing the specific timelines and memberships of various international organizations and summits. The question tests knowledge of international organizations and their key features, demanding accurate recall of establishment dates and membership details.  The distractors use similar organizations and events to increase difficulty.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention                      Subject Matter
1. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention                 :   Prohibition of the development and use of chemical weapons
2. 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention                  :   Prohibition of the development, production, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons
3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court :   Establishment of a court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.  Option 1 incorrectly attributes this to chemical weapons. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention accurately bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, making option 2 incorrect in its attribution.  The 1998 Rome Statute correctly established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for the listed crimes.  Therefore, only pair 3 is correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairs that misrepresent the subject matter of the conventions. The question tests factual recall of international treaties and their specific focuses.  Understanding the distinct roles of these conventions is crucial for comprehending international law and global security.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                                 Key Function/Activity
1. Universal Postal Union (UPU)                          :   Regulates international maritime trade and security
2. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)           :   Provides financial assistance primarily for infrastructure projects in Asia
3. Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)+ :   Coordinates global efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the United Nations responsible for coordinating postal policies and services globally.  It does not regulate maritime trade. Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) focuses on financing infrastructure development in Asia, making pair 2 correct. OPEC+ is a group of oil-producing countries that coordinate oil production and pricing policies.  It is not involved in combating money laundering or terrorist financing. Pair 3 is therefore incorrect.  The correct answer is (b) because only the description of AIIB's function is accurate. The question tests the understanding of the roles of different international organizations, requiring factual recall and the ability to differentiate between their functions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   UN Agency/Initiative                                    Focus Area
1. UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF)             :   Improving global food security through nuclear techniques
2. United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) :   Promoting sustainable development and economic cooperation among developing countries
3.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC)     :   Combating illicit drug trafficking and transnational crime


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) addresses disruptions in global supply chains, not food security.  Therefore, pair 1 is incorrect. UNCTAD's primary role is promoting international trade and economic cooperation, particularly for developing countries, making pair 2 correct. The UNODC works to combat drug trafficking and other forms of transnational organized crime, making pair 3 correct.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they include pairs that misrepresent the agency's focus. The question assesses the understanding of UN agencies and their mandates, demanding factual knowledge and analytical skills to distinguish between their core functions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                       Key Initiative/Outcome
1.  G7                                                    :  Establishment of the International Criminal Court
2.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)              :  Creation of a Supply Chain Council to strengthen critical supply chains
3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)               :   Launch of the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The G7 is a group of leading industrialized nations; it did not establish the International Criminal Court (that was the Rome Statute). Pair 1 is thus incorrect.  The IPEF has indeed established a Supply Chain Council, making pair 2 correct. The SCO focuses on regional security and economic cooperation in Eurasia; it is not associated with the "Quad Cancer Moonshot." Pair 3 is incorrect. The question tests the understanding of various international groupings and their specific actions, requiring knowledge of their initiatives and outcomes.  The close relationship between IPEF and supply chain initiatives might make option (b) seem less obvious, increasing the question's difficulty.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country/Region                                          Significant Event/Development

2.  Nagaland                                               :  Karbi Anglong Agreement
3.  Kazakhstan                                             :  24th SCO Summit


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Bru-Reang Agreement directly addresses the displacement of the Bru community, primarily affecting Tripura and Mizoram.  Pair 1 is correctly matched. The Karbi Anglong Agreement pertains to Assam, not Nagaland. Pair 2 is therefore incorrect. The 24th SCO summit was held in Astana, Kazakhstan, making pair 3 correct.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatching of events and locations. This question demands detailed knowledge of specific regional agreements and international summits, highlighting the need for precise recall of geographical and political context.  The inclusion of plausible distractors increases the difficulty level.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                     Key Programme/Initiative
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) : Atoms4NetZero (promoting nuclear energy for net-zero emissions)

3. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)         : Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) on combating money laundering

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative directly addresses the promotion of nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions.  The ITU is indeed responsible for releasing the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), which assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments.  The FATF's core function involves conducting Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) to assess countries' measures against money laundering and terrorist financing.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all three correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer.  There are no incorrect pairings present.  The question tests factual recall of international organizations and their key initiatives, assessing a candidate's knowledge of global governance and international cooperation in critical sectors like energy, cybersecurity, and financial crime.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention              Key Feature/Objective
1. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention          :  Prohibits development and use of biological weapons
2. 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention            :  Bans production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons
3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Prosecutes individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide
4. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 (India):  India's domestic legislation implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention focuses on prohibiting the development and use of biological weapons. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention aims to ban the production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court with the power to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. India's Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is the domestic legislation enacted to align with the international Chemical Weapons Convention. Thus, all pairs accurately reflect the features and objectives of the respective agreements/conventions. The question tests the candidate's understanding of international law and the mechanisms for regulating and prohibiting the use of weapons of mass destruction.  It also demonstrates knowledge of India’s compliance with international conventions.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                     Significant Feature/Recent Development

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurate pairings of countries with their significant features or recent developments in relation to India. Australia's National Defence Strategy 2024 indeed identifies India as a top-tier security partner. The UK and India have recently signed an agreement to enhance collaboration in health and life sciences. The US designated India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016.  Vietnam and India elevated their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2016.  The question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of India's bilateral relations with key countries, testing their understanding of strategic partnerships and areas of cooperation in defense, trade, and other sectors. The option (d) is the correct answer as all the pairs are correctly matched.

(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) saw India's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda, marking its first operation since joining in 2022.  Singapore did join the International Solar Alliance (ISA). The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) indeed involves India and five ASEAN countries, one of them being Vietnam. Malaysia did join the International Big Cat Alliance (IBCA) as a founding member. The question tests the candidate's awareness of various international and regional initiatives, showcasing their knowledge of India's engagement in multilateral cooperation.  Option (d) accurately reflects the correct matching of all pairs.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the four pairs accurately matches the Act/Legislation with its key provision or feature. The PMLA, 2002 directly addresses money laundering. The UAPA, 1967 deals with unlawful activities, including terrorism. The AFSPA, 1958 grants special powers to the armed forces in specific areas.  The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, implements the international Chemical Weapons Convention in India.  The question tests knowledge of Indian legislation concerning security, crime, and international treaties. Option (d) is the correct answer as all pairs are correctly matched.  The question is designed to assess the candidate's understanding of Indian law and its alignment with international norms.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Convention                                      Key Feature/Provision
1. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000           :   India's ratification of the Chemical Weapons Convention
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
3. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967:   Primarily focuses on combating terrorist financing
4. Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal     :   Facilitates international cooperation in criminal investigations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, is a direct result of India becoming a signatory and party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, making statement 1 correct.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, while not directly establishing the FIU-IND (which was established in 2004), is crucial to its function and forms a significant part of India's anti-money laundering framework. However, the FIU-IND's establishment is a separate event, making statement 2 slightly inaccurate in its direct correlation. The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, is indeed primarily concerned with tackling unlawful activities, including those related to terrorist financing, making statement 3 correct. Finally, the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal enhances international cooperation, directly supporting the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only statements 1, 3, and 4 represent accurate pairings.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                    Report/Initiative

2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC):   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)
3. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB)    :   World Wildlife Crime Report 2024
4. Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) : Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The FATF is known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assessing countries' anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism measures, not the World Drug Day Report. The UNODC, however, is responsible for releasing the World Drug Day Report and the World Wildlife Crime Report, making statement 2 correct regarding the latter.  The INCB is a separate entity focused on drug control, not the World Wildlife Crime Report. The CCPCJ launched the Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative, making statement 4 correct. Therefore, only statements 2 and 4 are correctly matched.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)                :   Atoms4Food
4.  UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF)      : Operation Crimson Barracuda


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's focus is on nuclear energy and safety, with programs like Atoms4Food and the Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB).  The ITU, on the other hand, released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI). The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) conducted Operation Crimson Barracuda.  The UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF) is focused on global supply chain resilience.  Therefore, only statements 3 and 4 are correctly matched.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

2. Egypt                                           :   Lake Turkana
3. India                                            :   Lipulekh Pass
4.  Tanzania                                        : Suez Canal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is located in Kenya and Ethiopia. Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania. Lipulekh Pass is a significant pass on the India-China-Nepal border. The Suez Canal is in Egypt. Therefore, only statement 3 is correctly matched.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Agreement                          Specific Initiative/Outcome
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)          :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
2. India-Bangladesh Relations                     :   Supply Chain Council
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)         :   India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)
4. Group of Seven (G7)                            :   Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IPEF established the Supply Chain Council.  India and Bangladesh have a bilateral relationship which includes the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant, but this is not a direct outcome of a specific IPEF initiative.  The SCO has initiatives related to counter-terrorism, but not directly named "Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism". The IMEC is a separate initiative.  The G7 has various initiatives, but not specifically the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant or the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline. Therefore, only statement 1 is correctly matched in a direct sense.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                     Key Feature/Initiative
1. Commonwealth Sub Window                    :   Established under India-UN Development Fund
2. BRICS New Development Bank                  :   HQ in Fortaleza, Brazil
3.  UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF)     :   Focus on strengthening supply chain resilience for SIDS
4.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)           :   First Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India adopted in 2022


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Commonwealth Sub Window was indeed established under the India-UN Development Fund in 2018, making pair 1 correct.  The UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF)  focuses on strengthening supply chain resilience, particularly for Small Island Developing States (SIDS), thus making pair 3 correct.  The Financial Action Task Force's (FATF) first Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India was adopted in 2010, not 2022, making pair 4 incorrect.  The BRICS New Development Bank's headquarters are in Shanghai, China, not Fortaleza, Brazil, making pair 2 incorrect.  The correct option is (b) because only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The distractors are designed to test the candidate's detailed knowledge of the organizations and their initiatives, forcing them to recall specific details rather than relying on general knowledge.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative                   Specific Action/Outcome
1.  India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting                :   Adoption of Joint Action Plan 2024-2028
2.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF)   :   Annual Board meeting held in India in 2024
3.  UNODC World Drug Day Report                       :   Highlighted triple frontier area as most affected
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)       :   Requested assistance for low-income countries


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting did adopt the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028, making pair 1 correct. The UNODC World Drug Day Report accurately highlighted the Triple Frontier Area (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) as one of the most affected regions by drug abuse, making pair 3 correct. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) was indeed requested to assist low-income countries in accessing financial resources, making pair 4 correct. However, the Commonwealth Local Government Forum's (CLGF) Annual Board meeting was held in Sri Lanka, not India, making pair 2 incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is (b), as only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  The incorrect options are carefully constructed to include plausible but ultimately false connections, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of the events and organizations involved.


**3. With reference to international cooperation, consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Convention                   Key Feature/Impact
1.  Chemical Weapons Convention                     :   India enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000
2.  UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) :   Supported by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003
3.  Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC) :   Issued arrest warrant against Russia's President in 2022
4.  Biological Weapons Convention                     :   Prohibits development and use of biological weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  India is a signatory to and has enacted legislation compliant with the Chemical Weapons Convention, making pair 1 correct. The UNTOC is indeed supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, making pair 2 correct. The ICC did issue an arrest warrant against Russia's President in March 2023, aligning with pair 3. The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, the correct answer is (d). The inclusion of all correct pairs serves as a strong distractor, demanding complete accuracy from the candidate.  A slight inaccuracy in any single pair would lead to an incorrect answer.


**4. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                  Headquarters Location
1.  New Development Bank (NDB)                 :   Shanghai, China
2.  Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) :   New Delhi, India
3.  Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF):   London, UK
4.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :  Vienna, Austria

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The New Development Bank (NDB) is headquartered in Shanghai, China (pair 1 correct). The Commonwealth Local Government Forum (CLGF) is headquartered in London, UK (pair 3 correct). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is headquartered in Vienna, Austria (pair 4 correct). However, the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) is not located in New Delhi;  its location is not explicitly stated in the provided text, making pair 2 incorrect. Therefore, the correct answer is (b), as only pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  This question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between correct and incorrect information based on precise details, rather than general knowledge of the organizations.


**5. With reference to recent international events, consider the following pairs:**

   Event/Summit                                  Key Outcome/Participant
1.  Path to Peace Summit                         :   India abstained from signing the joint communique
2.  16th BRICS Summit                           :   Launch of BRICS Grain Exchange
3.  India-Bangladesh relations                  :   Bangladesh joined the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative
4.  UNSC debate on women, peace, and security   :   Launch of Common Pledge Initiative


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1 and 4 only
(d) All four


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect key outcomes or participants from recent international events.  India did indeed abstain from signing the joint communique at the Path to Peace Summit (pair 1 correct). The 16th BRICS Summit did launch the BRICS Grain Exchange (pair 2 correct). Bangladesh did join the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative as part of enhanced India-Bangladesh relations (pair 3 correct). The UNSC debate on women, peace, and security did lead to the launch of the Common Pledge Initiative (pair 4 correct).  Therefore, the correct answer is (d).  The question effectively assesses the candidate's awareness of significant recent global events and their key features, requiring precise recall of facts rather than general understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                    Key Economic Relationship with India
1. Bhutan                   :   India's leading source of investments in Bhutan
2. Bangladesh              :   India's biggest trade partner in South Asia
3. Maldives                 :   India is building a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll
4. China                     :   India has a significant trade deficit with China in goods
5. Mauritius                :   India inaugurated its first overseas Jan Aushadhi Kendra (JAK)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 4 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because it accurately reflects the key economic relationships between India and the listed countries.  Bhutan is indeed a recipient of significant Indian investment, making statement 1 correct. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, aligning with statement 2.  China presents a major trade imbalance, with India experiencing a substantial deficit, making statement 4 correct.  Finally, India's establishment of a Jan Aushadhi Kendra in Mauritius validates statement 5.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's construction of a Coast Guard base in the Maldives demonstrates a security and strategic partnership, it's not primarily an economic relationship in the same vein as the others. The base serves primarily geopolitical and security objectives, not direct economic exchange or trade.  The other statements accurately represent key economic aspects of India's bilateral relations with the respective countries.  The inclusion of the Coast Guard base as an economic relationship would be a mischaracterization.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Specific Bilateral Initiative with India
1. Bhutan                   :   Development of ‘India-Bhutan SAT’
2. Bangladesh              :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
3. Maldives                 :   Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)
4. China                     :   Disengagement and resumption of patrolling in Depsang Plains and Demchok
5. Nepal                     :   Arun III hydropower project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include the pairing of China with the disengagement in the Depsang plains and Demchok areas. While this is a significant development in India-China relations, it's not a bilateral *initiative* in the same sense as the other examples. The others represent specific projects or agreements undertaken jointly.  The disengagement is a step towards de-escalation in a tense border situation, not a joint project or economic cooperation initiative.

Option (b) correctly matches the other four pairs.  The development of the India-Bhutan SAT, the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant, the Currency Swap Agreement with the Maldives, and the Arun III hydropower project are all specific examples of bilateral initiatives between India and the respective countries.  These represent concrete collaborations in areas like space technology, energy, finance, and hydropower, respectively.


**3. With reference to India's relations with its neighbours, consider the following pairs:**

Country                     Key Characteristic of the Relationship
1. Bhutan                   :   Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (1949, renewed 2007)
2. Bangladesh              :   Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT)
3. Maldives                 :   Operation Neer (2014) and Vaccine Maitri (COVID-19)
4. China                     :   Line of Actual Control (LAC) disputes
5. Nepal                     :   BBIN initiative (Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched.  The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation forms the bedrock of India-Bhutan relations. The PIWTT is a key element of India-Bangladesh trade and connectivity.  Operation Neer and Vaccine Maitri highlight India's humanitarian assistance to the Maldives during crises.  The LAC disputes define a major aspect of India-China relations.  Finally, Nepal's participation (or lack thereof) in the BBIN initiative is a relevant aspect of regional cooperation. Each pair accurately identifies a significant and defining characteristic of the respective bilateral relationship.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Therefore, all five pairs are correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Key Economic Feature
1. Bhutan                      Top trade partner is India
2. Bangladesh                 Largest trade partner of India in South Asia
3. Maldives                    Currency Swap Agreement with India
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched based on the provided information.  Bhutan's significant economic dependence on India is highlighted by India being its largest trading partner.  This reflects a long-standing bilateral relationship and India's substantial investment in Bhutan's economy.  Similarly, Bangladesh's position as India's largest trading partner in South Asia underscores the strong economic ties between the two nations. The substantial trade volume reflects close regional integration and shared economic interests. Finally, the Currency Swap Agreement between India and the Maldives is a concrete example of economic cooperation between the two countries, aimed at stabilizing exchange rates and bolstering the Maldives' foreign exchange reserves. This highlights India's role in supporting the Maldives' economic stability.  The other options are incorrect because they omit at least one of these accurately matched pairs, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive understanding of the economic relationships.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                      Hydropower Project
1. Bhutan                      Arun III Hydropower Project
2. Bhutan                      Chukha Hydropower Project
3. Nepal                       Upper Karnali Hydropower Project
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The Chukha Hydropower Project is explicitly mentioned as an example of an Indian-constructed project in Bhutan.  The Upper Karnali Hydropower Project is cited as a project involving India and Nepal.  Pair 1 is incorrect; while Nepal has several hydropower projects, Arun III is not specifically linked to Bhutan in the provided context. The inclusion of Arun III as a distractor tests the candidate's knowledge of regional hydropower projects and their specific geographical locations. Option (a) is incorrect as it only includes one correct pairing. Option (b) is incorrect because it only includes one correct pairing and omits another correct one. Option (d) is incorrect because it includes an incorrect pairing (Arun III with Bhutan).


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country             Specific Economic Initiative
1. Maldives           Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
2. Bangladesh        India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline
3. Bhutan             RuPay card implementation


(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is explicitly mentioned as a key initiative in the given text.  Pair 1 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is associated with India-Bangladesh relations, not India-Maldives.  Similarly, pair 3 is incorrect; while RuPay expansion is mentioned in the context of India-Maldives relations, the implementation of RuPay cards is not the primary or defining economic initiative highlighted for Bhutan.  The inclusion of these incorrect pairs serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives and correctly associate them with the correct country. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Country                  Energy Cooperation Initiative
1. India-Bangladesh       Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor
2. India-Nepal             TAPI Gas Pipeline
3. India-Bhutan           Motihari-Amlekhganj Pipeline

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor is explicitly mentioned as an upcoming initiative between India and Bangladesh.  Pair 2 is incorrect; the TAPI gas pipeline involves Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India, not India and Nepal. Pair 3 is incorrect; the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is related to India-Nepal oil pipeline cooperation, not specifically energy cooperation initiatives involving Bhutan.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, testing the candidate's ability to accurately identify specific energy cooperation initiatives within the context of various bilateral relationships. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**5. With reference to cross-border energy trade in South Asia, consider the following pairs:**

   Country Pair              Energy Resource
1. India-Bangladesh         Natural Gas
2. India-Nepal              Electricity
3. India-Bhutan             Electricity

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  The text explicitly mentions electricity trade between India and Nepal (via projects like Arun III and Upper Karnali) and between India and Bhutan (via projects like Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu).  Pair 1 is incorrect; while the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports oil, natural gas trade is not explicitly highlighted as a major component of their cross-border energy cooperation in the provided information.  The inclusion of this incorrect pair serves as a strong distractor, requiring the candidate to carefully distinguish between different energy resources and their relevant bilateral agreements.  Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they include at least one incorrectly matched pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Major Trading Partner (Goods, 2023)
1. India                        :   China
2. Bangladesh                 :   India
3. Bhutan                       :   India
4. Maldives                    :   India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because the provided information accurately reflects the major trading partners for India, Bangladesh, and Bhutan in 2023.  China was India's largest trading partner in goods during 2023.  Bangladesh's biggest trade partner in South Asia is India, and India is Bhutan's top trade partner.  The question includes a distractor (Maldives) to test the candidate's precise knowledge, as the provided text does not specify Maldives' major trading partner in goods for 2023.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correctly matched pairs or include the incorrectly matched pair of Maldives and India. The question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between accurate and potentially plausible but inaccurate information.


**2. With reference to cross-border electricity trade initiatives in South Asia, consider the following pairs:**

   Country Pair              Specific Project/Initiative
1. India-Bangladesh          :   Arun III Hydropower Project
2. India-Nepal               :   Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor
3. India-Bhutan              :   Upper Karnali Hydropower Project (UKHP)
4. India-Bangladesh          : Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only option (d) is correct. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a collaborative project between India and Bangladesh.  The other options present incorrect pairings. The Arun III and Upper Karnali Hydropower projects are associated with India-Nepal cooperation, not India-Bangladesh. The Katihar-Bornagar Electricity Corridor is an India-Bangladesh initiative, not an India-Nepal one. This question assesses factual recall and requires careful analysis of the pairings to avoid being misled by similar-sounding projects or countries.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Energy Pipeline             Primary Purpose/Resource Transported
1. TAPI Pipeline             :   Crude Oil
2. India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline:   Natural Gas
3. Motihari-Amlekhganj Pipeline:   Electricity
4.  India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline:  LPG


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only option (b) is correct. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports natural gas. The TAPI pipeline transports natural gas, not crude oil.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports petroleum products, not electricity.  Including a second entry for the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline with an incorrect resource (LPG) serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to identify the correct pairing amidst similar options.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to discern between closely related but ultimately incorrect options.


**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Key Initiative/Agreement
1. Bhutan                      :   Currency Swap Agreement
2. Maldives                   :   Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation
3. Bangladesh                 :   Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership
4. Maldives                   : RuPay Card Launch


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct.  India and Maldives have launched RuPay cards, and the Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership was announced between India and the Maldives. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation is a key agreement between India and Bhutan, not India and Maldives.  A Currency Swap Agreement is not mentioned in the given text as a major initiative between India and Bhutan.  The incorrect pairings serve as distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the specific initiatives undertaken by India with different countries. This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar initiatives within the broader context of India's bilateral relations.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Significant Bordering State/Region (India)
1. Bangladesh                 :   Arunachal Pradesh
2. Bhutan                      :   West Bengal
3. Myanmar                    :   Mizoram
4. Nepal                       : Assam


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Option (b) is correct. Bhutan shares a border with West Bengal, and Myanmar shares a border with Mizoram.  Bangladesh borders West Bengal, not Arunachal Pradesh. Nepal borders multiple Indian states, but Assam is not explicitly mentioned in relation to Nepal's border in the given text. The incorrect pairings act as distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of India's borders with its neighboring countries.  The question tests factual recall and attention to detail regarding geographical information.  This is a difficult question due to the plausible but ultimately incorrect options.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                     Major Port
1. Iran                         Shahid Beheshti Port
2. Egypt                        Port Said
3. Kenya                       Mombasa Port
4. China                        Shanghai Port


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The FATF is indeed known for its Mutual Evaluation Reports assessing countries' anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing measures. The UNODC's Global Firearms Programme is a well-established initiative focusing on reducing illicit firearms trafficking.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero directly addresses the use of nuclear energy in achieving net-zero emissions goals, a prominent aspect of its work. Finally, the ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index is a well-documented event.  There are no inaccuracies or mismatches in any of the pairs provided.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incorrect as they omit correctly matched pairs.


**2. With reference to international relations and agreements, consider the following pairs:**

     Agreement/Initiative                    Key Feature/Participant
    1.  Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) :  Exemption for India regarding S-400 purchase (2018)
    2.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :  India having a trade deficit with ASEAN
    3.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) : Belarus joining as the 10th member
    4.  Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) :  India elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each pair accurately reflects a key aspect of the respective agreement or initiative.  The CAATSA Act did indeed include a specific amendment exempting India from sanctions related to the S-400 missile system purchase. AITIGA's existence and the fact that India experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN are both verifiable.  The SCO's expansion to include Belarus as its tenth member is a matter of public record.  Finally, India's role as Vice-Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council is also a documented fact.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relationships, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                 Key Aspect of Relationship
    1. Bangladesh                             :  Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
    2. United Kingdom                        :  Ajeya Warrior military exercises
    3.  United States                          :  COMCASA agreement (2018)
    4. Nepal                                 : Arun III hydropower project


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs represent accurately documented features of India's bilateral relationships.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a key element of India-Bangladesh energy cooperation.  The Ajeya Warrior exercises are a significant part of the India-UK defense partnership.  The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) is a well-known aspect of the India-US defense cooperation, signed in 2018. Finally, the Arun III hydropower project is a concrete example of India's engagement with Nepal in the energy sector.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all four correctly matched pairs is the correct answer. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and, therefore, incorrect.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

    1. Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)   :  Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
    2. Biological Weapons Convention (1972) :  Prohibits the development and use of biological weapons.
    3. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :  Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND)
    4. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs accurately reflect the key features of the respective acts and conventions. The Chemical Weapons Convention explicitly prohibits the production and use of chemical weapons; the Biological Weapons Convention similarly addresses biological weapons. The PMLA, while not directly establishing the FIU in its original form, is the primary legislative framework under which the FIU operates and functions.  Finally, the Rome Statute is the founding document for the International Criminal Court (ICC) and outlines its jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  Therefore, all four are correctly matched, making option (d) the correct choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and thus incorrect.


**5. With reference to international organizations and their activities, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                    Activity/Initiative
    1.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)               :  150th Anniversary Commemorative Postage Stamps
    2.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)           : Operation Crimson Barracuda
    3.  Group of Seven (G7)                         :  Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII)
    4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB):  Assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs correctly link the organization with a relevant activity or initiative. The UPU's issuance of commemorative stamps for its anniversary is a standard practice. The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda under the CMF is a documented event.  The G7's PGII initiative is a well-known program.  Finally, the AIIB's stated goal includes providing financial assistance to low-income countries. Hence, all four pairs are correctly matched, and option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative         Key Feature/Participating Nation
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council :   India elected as Vice-Chair
2. India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) :   Cornerstone of global connectivity
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)  :   Belarus's membership
4. Group of Seven (G7) Summit              :   India's participation as an Outreach Country
5.  ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)             :   India's membership since 1996

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) did indeed elect India as Vice-Chair of its Supply Chain Council.  The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is explicitly described as aiming to be a cornerstone of global connectivity. Belarus joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) as its tenth member. India participated in the G7 Summit as an Outreach Country. Finally, India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996, a fact explicitly stated in the provided text.  Therefore, option (d) encompassing all five correctly matched pairs is the accurate answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair, demonstrating an incomplete understanding of the given information.  The question tests factual recall and the ability to correctly match entities and their attributes.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Agreement/Initiative          Key Aspect/Outcome
1. BIMSTEC Charter                         :   Acquired 'legal personality' in May 2024
2.  Strengthening the Quad Act            :   Passed by the US House of Representatives
3.  ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   India has a trade deficit with ASEAN
4.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework     :   Announced by the RBI for 2024-2027
5.  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India :   First adopted in 2010 by FATF

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The BIMSTEC Charter coming into force granted BIMSTEC legal personality, as stated in the text. The US House of Representatives passing the "Strengthening the Quad Act" is a factual event. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) resulted in India having a trade deficit with ASEAN. The RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 is confirmed. Finally, India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF was first adopted in 2010. Therefore, option (d), which includes all five pairs, is correct. The other options are incorrect because they exclude at least one correct pair, indicating a failure to comprehend all the facts. This question tests factual recall and the ability to match international agreements/initiatives with their relevant details.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                    Significant Bilateral Relationship Aspect
1. Bangladesh                             :   India's largest trade partner in South Asia
2. Maldives                               :   Launched RuPay card in Maldives
3. Singapore                              :   India's largest trade partner in ASEAN in 2023-24
4. Vietnam                                :   State visit by Vietnam's Prime Minister to India
5. Japan                                    :   Composed of four main islands: Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Four out of the five pairs are correctly matched. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  The launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives is a confirmed event.  Singapore's position as India's largest trading partner in ASEAN during 2023-24 is verified by the provided text. The state visit by Vietnam's Prime Minister to India is also mentioned. However, while Japan is composed of four main islands, the question's focus is on bilateral relationships, making this pair less relevant in the context of the other pairs focusing on international relations. Therefore, option (d) is the most appropriate choice, encompassing the four pairs directly relevant to bilateral relations. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, neglecting one or more correct pairs. This question tests factual recall and understanding of India's bilateral relationships with different countries, focusing on specific economic and diplomatic engagements.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Initiative                     Key Programme/Initiative
1.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :   Atoms4Food Programme
2.  International Telecommunication Union (ITU):   Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)        :   Operation Crimson Barracuda
4.  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   World Wildlife Crime Report 2024
5.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)     :   Mutual Evaluation Report (MER)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) Only one
(b) Only two
(c) All three
(d) All five


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched. The IAEA's Atoms4Food programme, the ITU's release of the Global Cybersecurity Index 2024, the CMF's Operation Crimson Barracuda, the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, and the FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports are all accurately paired with their respective organizations or initiatives. The question tests factual recall of international organizations and their specific activities, requiring a detailed understanding of their roles and functions.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they underrepresent the number of correctly matched pairs.  The comprehensive nature of the correct answer highlights the necessity for thorough knowledge of international organizations.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                Capital City
1. Maldives             Colombo
2. Thailand             Bangkok
3. Lao PDR              Vientiane
4. Uzbekistan           Tashkent
5. Philippines          Manila

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (b) because only pairs 2, 3, 4, and 5 correctly match the country with its capital city. Bangkok is the capital of Thailand, Vientiane is the capital of Lao PDR, Tashkent is the capital of Uzbekistan, and Manila is the capital of the Philippines.  Option (a) is incorrect because Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka, not the Maldives; Male is the capital of the Maldives. Option (c) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) is incorrect as it includes the incorrectly matched pair of Maldives and Colombo. This question tests factual recall of capital cities, a fundamental aspect of geographical knowledge crucial for UPSC aspirants.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as Colombo (a capital city in the region), makes the question challenging and assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding or geographically proximate entities.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

River                       Country
1. Omo River                 Kenya
2. Yangtze River             China
3. Mekong River              Laos
4. Mississippi River         USA
5. Jamuna River              India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct option is (c). The Yangtze River is in China, the Mekong River flows through Laos, the Mississippi River is in the USA, and the Jamuna River (a distributary of the Brahmaputra) is in India and Bangladesh. Option (a) is incorrect because while the Omo River is geographically close to Kenya, it primarily flows through Ethiopia and is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana. Options (a) and (b) are incorrect because they exclude correctly matched pairs.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of major rivers and their locations, demonstrating their understanding of global geography and the ability to distinguish between geographically related entities.  The inclusion of the Omo River, which is associated with a nearby country, creates a challenging distractor.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

1. Lake Turkana                   Tanzania
2. Mount Kilimanjaro               Kenya
3. Lipulekh Pass                   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal                      Egypt
5. Taklimakan Desert              Nepal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 5 only
(d) 3, 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (d). Lipulekh Pass is located in Uttarakhand, India, and the Suez Canal is in Egypt.  Option (a) is incorrect because Lake Turkana is situated in Kenya and Ethiopia, not Tanzania. Option (b) is partially correct, but it omits the correctly matched pair of the Suez Canal. Option (c) is incorrect; Mount Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania, not Kenya, and the Taklimakan Desert is in China.  This question tests the candidate’s ability to recall geographical locations and match them with specific features. The distractors are carefully chosen to be geographically plausible yet incorrect, testing the examinee's precision in recalling specific locations.


**4.  Consider the following pairs:**

3. Reporters Without Borders        :   Publishes the World Press Freedom Index
4. MERCOSUR                        :   A South American trade bloc
5. Colombo Process                  :   Focuses on Migration Management


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 3, 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c). Reporters Without Borders (RSF) does publish the World Press Freedom Index, MERCOSUR is indeed a South American trade bloc, and the Colombo Process focuses on migration management. Option (a) is incorrect because the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is headquartered in Beijing, China, not Bahrain. Option (b) is partially correct but incomplete. Option (d) includes the incorrectly matched pairs of the AIIB and the Arab League.  This question assesses the candidate’s knowledge of international organizations and their functions.  The distractors are designed to test their ability to accurately recall the functions and locations of different organizations, requiring a deeper understanding than simple recognition.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

3. Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline    :  India and Nepal
4. Arun III Hydropower Project     :  India and Bhutan
5. Kurichu Hydropower Project       :  India and Nepal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1, 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c).  The TAPI pipeline involves India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Turkmenistan; the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline connects India and Bangladesh; the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline links India and Nepal; and the Arun III Hydropower Project is a joint venture between India and Nepal. Option (a) is incorrect because it does not include the Arun III project.  Option (b) is identical to (a). Option (d) is incorrect because the Kurichu Hydropower Project is located in Bhutan, not Nepal. This question tests knowledge of energy cooperation initiatives between India and its neighboring countries, highlighting the importance of regional connectivity and energy security in India's foreign policy.  The inclusion of similar-sounding projects and countries makes the question more challenging and requires precise recall.

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs are correctly matched.  The FATF uses Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) as a key tool to assess countries' effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  The UNODC's annual report for World Drug Day consistently highlights global drug trends, with cannabis frequently cited as the most widely abused substance. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) is a crucial resource for tracking illicit nuclear trafficking incidents globally. The ITU publishes the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) to benchmark nations' cybersecurity preparedness. Finally, Operation Crimson Barracuda, a drug seizure operation in the Arabian Sea, was conducted under the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), highlighting the collaborative nature of this maritime security initiative.  Each pair accurately reflects a key function or significant activity associated with the named organization or agreement. There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.

2.  SAARC                                                  :   RBI announces SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027
3.  ASEAN                                                  :   5th Joint Committee Meeting to review ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA)
4.  Quad                                                    :   Adopted the Wilmington Declaration at the Quad Leaders’ Summit
5.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)                :   Belarus becomes its tenth member


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All five pairs accurately reflect key aspects of the respective regional cooperation initiatives. BIMSTEC's entry into force of its charter signifies its strengthened legal framework and institutionalization. The RBI's announcement of a SAARC Currency Swap Framework underscores financial cooperation within the South Asian region.  ASEAN's 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA indicates ongoing efforts to review and improve trade relations between ASEAN and India. The Quad Leaders’ Summit and the subsequent adoption of the Wilmington Declaration highlight the group's collaborative agenda and commitment to specific initiatives. Finally, Belarus' accession to the SCO marked a significant expansion of the organization's membership.  Each pairing represents a verifiable fact related to the specified initiative.  No option presents an inaccurate or questionable association.



**3. With reference to India's Bilateral Relations, consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                                  Key Development/Initiative
1. Maldives                                                 :   Launch of RuPay card and signing of a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA)
2.  Bhutan                                                   :   Hydropower projects like Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu

5.  Middle East                                             :   India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each of the five pairs accurately describes a significant development or initiative within the specified bilateral relationship.  The Maldives has seen the introduction of RuPay cards and a currency swap agreement with India. Bhutan and India have a long-standing collaboration on hydropower projects, including those mentioned. The UK and India have strengthened their cooperation in health and life sciences. The US granted India an exemption from CAATSA sanctions for its purchase of Russian S-400 systems.  Finally, the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) reflects India's efforts to enhance connectivity and economic partnerships in the Middle East. All the information provided in the pairs is factually accurate and reflects well-documented aspects of these bilateral relationships.  There is no room for misinterpretation or doubt in any of the pairings.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Convention/Treaty                Focus Area
1. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)         :   Prohibition of development and use of biological weapons
2. Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)           :   Banning the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
3. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (1998) :   Prosecuting individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide
4.  Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 : Combating terrorist financing
5. UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 : Combating Transnational Organized Crimes

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 2, 3, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention (1972) explicitly prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (1993) similarly bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. The Rome Statute (1998) established the International Criminal Court (ICC) with the mandate to prosecute individuals for the gravest international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, is a crucial piece of Indian legislation aimed at combating money laundering, which often finances terrorist activities.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention) is a significant international legal instrument designed to combat transnational organized crime, a broad category encompassing various criminal activities.

Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing of UNTOC, 2000. Option (c) is incorrect as it wrongly includes the PMLA, 2002, within the context of international conventions rather than domestic legislation. Option (d) is too narrow, excluding several correctly matched pairs.  Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings among the given options.


**2. With reference to international organizations and treaties, consider the following pairs:**

   Organization/Treaty                     Key Feature/Objective
1. FATF                                     :   Combating money laundering and terrorist financing
2. UNODC                                    :   Addressing drug abuse and illicit trafficking
3.  IAEA                                     :   Monitoring illicit nuclear trafficking
4.  CWC                                      :   Regulating chemical weapons

(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is indeed focused on combating money laundering and terrorist financing through international cooperation and setting standards.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) works extensively on drug control, crime prevention, and criminal justice, directly addressing drug abuse and illicit trafficking. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) plays a crucial role in monitoring nuclear material and preventing its illicit trafficking through its Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB). The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) establishes a framework for the international regulation of chemical weapons, aiming to prevent their use, production, and stockpiling.  The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) is a multinational naval coalition dedicated to maritime security operations, including countering piracy and other transnational crimes in crucial maritime regions.

All the pairs provided are correctly matched; therefore, option (d) is the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, failing to include all the correctly matched pairs.

The Malabar Naval Exercises exemplify the strong defense cooperation between India and the United States. India and Nepal have joint hydropower projects, including Arun III. All the given pairs accurately reflect a key aspect of India's bilateral relations with the specified countries.  Therefore, option (d) is the correct answer, encompassing all correctly matched pairs.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete, omitting correctly matched pairs.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

International Agreement                     Focus Area
1. Biological Weapons Convention, 1972   :   Prohibition of chemical weapons development and use
2. Chemical Weapons Convention, 1993    :   Prohibition of biological weapons development and use
3. Rome Statute for International Criminal Court, 1998 : Prosecution of war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. This is accurately reflected in pair 3.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) of 1993 bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. Pair 2 correctly reflects this.  However, pair 1 incorrectly attributes the prohibition of chemical weapons to the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) of 1972. The BWC focuses on biological weapons, not chemical weapons. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched.  Understanding the specific mandates of each international agreement is crucial for comprehending international law and global security frameworks. The question tests the candidate's ability to distinguish between closely related international treaties and their specific objectives, a key skill for analyzing global governance structures.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Organization                                 Primary Function
1. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)     :   Combating illicit drug trafficking and money laundering
2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) : Assessing measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing
3. International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) : Monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The UNODC's primary function is to combat drug trafficking, crime, and corruption globally.  This aligns perfectly with pair 2. The FATF focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, not directly on illicit drug trafficking, making pair 1 incorrect.  The IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency), not the INCB, is primarily responsible for monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking, making pair 3 incorrect.  This question highlights the importance of understanding the nuanced roles of various international organizations in global security and governance.  The inclusion of plausible distractors, such as FATF's involvement in financial crime and INCB's seemingly relevant function, tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding organizations and their distinct mandates.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

3.  Combined Maritime Forces (CMF)         :  Seized drugs in the Arabian Sea under Operation Crimson Barracuda

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) conducted Operation Crimson Barracuda, resulting in drug seizures. This is accurately depicted in pair 3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) focuses on nuclear issues, not cybersecurity indices, making pair 1 incorrect.  The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) works on telecommunication standards and cybersecurity but doesn't maintain a database on nuclear material theft; that falls under the IAEA's purview, making pair 2 incorrect. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of the activities of different international organizations, demonstrating their understanding of global cooperation in various sectors.  The carefully chosen distractors ensure that only candidates with a thorough understanding of these organizations and their respective functions can accurately identify the correct match.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

2.  East Asia Summit (EAS)                  :   Established in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 2005
3.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework          :   Covers a period of 2024-2027

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs are correctly matched. ASEAN + 3 indeed includes the mentioned countries. The East Asia Summit (EAS) was established as stated. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework does cover the period 2024-2027.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of various regional organizations and their characteristics. The inclusion of all correct pairs necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, preventing simple guessing.  The question effectively tests the candidate's ability to recall factual information about different regional groupings and their recent activities.

2.  India                                    : Elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council
3.  Nepal, India, Bangladesh                 : Signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three pairs accurately reflect significant developments. Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative, India's role in the IPEF's Supply Chain Council, and the trilateral electricity trade pact between Nepal, India, and Bangladesh are all correctly stated.  This question tests the candidate's knowledge of recent geopolitical and economic developments in the specified regions.  The fact that all options are correct emphasizes the need for a broad and up-to-date understanding of current affairs.  The question successfully differentiates candidates with a strong grasp of recent events from those with a superficial understanding.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Convention             Prominent Feature
1. 1972 Biological Weapons Convention      :   Prohibits development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons.
2. 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention      :   Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons.
3. 1998 Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) :  Established the International Criminal Court to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.
4. Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000 :  India's domestic legislation implementing the Chemical Weapons Convention.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention aims to prevent the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, a critical aspect of international arms control. Similarly, the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention focuses on eliminating chemical weapons, reflecting a global commitment to disarmament. The 1998 Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC), a significant step towards international justice and accountability for serious crimes.  Finally, the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrates India's commitment to the Chemical Weapons Convention by enacting domestic legislation to enforce its provisions.  Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit one or more correctly matched pairs.  The inclusion of all four pairs highlights a comprehensive understanding of international treaties and India's role in global efforts towards disarmament and international justice.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Agreement                                    Key Provision/Objective
1. Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) :  Aims to punish countries engaging deeply with Russia, North Korea, and Iran through economic sanctions.
2. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Established the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND).
3.  Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal   :    Facilitates international cooperation in combating money laundering.
4.  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), 1958 : Grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas" to maintain order.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CAATSA's primary goal is to impose sanctions on countries with significant dealings with designated adversaries. The PMLA, while aiming to prevent money laundering, doesn't directly establish the FIU-IND;  the FIU-IND was established separately but operates under the PMLA. The MLAT portal is designed to enhance international collaboration in law enforcement, specifically in areas like money laundering and terrorism financing.  AFSPA grants specific powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas".  Therefore, pairs 1, 3, and 4 are correctly matched.  Pair 2 is incorrectly matched because it incorrectly links the PMLA directly to the FIU-IND's establishment. The other options are incorrect as they exclude one or more of the correctly matched pairs.  Understanding the nuances of each act and agreement is crucial for a complete understanding of the Indian legal and international relations landscape.


**3.  With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

All four pairs represent accurate examples of cooperative initiatives or agreements between India and the respective countries. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and Bangladesh, highlighting energy cooperation. The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) reflects the growing technological partnership between India and the UK. The disengagement in the Depsang Plains and Demchok areas signifies progress in resolving border tensions between India and China.  LEMOA is a significant defense agreement between India and the US, enhancing logistics cooperation.  Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. The other options are incomplete, demonstrating a lack of comprehensive knowledge of India's bilateral relations.  A thorough understanding of these relationships is vital for analyzing India's foreign policy and strategic partnerships.


**4. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                   Key Function/Characteristic

2. United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) :   Released the World Drug Day report and World Wildlife Crime Report.
3.  Universal Postal Union (UPU)               :   A specialized agency of the United Nations.
4.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Assists low-income countries in accessing financial resources.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The FATF's core function is evaluating countries' efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing through mutual evaluations. The UNODC plays a crucial role in addressing drug-related issues and wildlife crime, as evidenced by its reports. The UPU is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations, focusing on postal services.  The AIIB's mandate includes providing financial assistance to low-income countries for infrastructure development. Therefore, pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  Option (d) is incorrect as it omits the correctly matched pair related to the UPU.  Options (a) and (b) are also incorrect because they leave out at least one correctly matched pair.  Understanding the functions of these international organizations is essential for comprehending global governance and development initiatives.

(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

La Paz serves as the administrative capital of Bolivia, while Sucre is its constitutional capital.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched if we consider the administrative capital. Panama City is indeed the capital of Panama (pair 2).  Port-au-Prince is the capital of Haiti, not Trinidad and Tobago; hence, pair 3 is incorrect. Wellington is correctly identified as the capital of New Zealand (pair 4).  Option (c) accurately reflects the correctly matched pairs. Options (a), (b), and (d) include incorrect pairings, making them unsuitable answers. The question tests factual recall of capital cities, a crucial element in geography and general awareness for the UPSC examination.  The inclusion of a distractor (Port-au-Prince) increases the difficulty and assesses the candidate's ability to accurately discern correct information from plausible but incorrect alternatives.

(b) 2, 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, 3 and 4
(d) 1 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Seine River flows into the English Channel (pair 1). The Omo River flows into Lake Turkana (pair 2). The Kaladan River flows into the Bay of Bengal (pair 3).  The Jamuna River is part of the Brahmaputra River system (pair 4). All four pairs are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate’s knowledge of river systems and their geographical courses. The options are designed to challenge the candidate’s ability to recall the information accurately.  The question emphasizes the importance of understanding river systems in geography.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

River Basin                     River
1. Koshi River Basin             :   Ganges River
2. Gandaki River Basin           :   Brahmaputra River
3. Indus River Basin             :   Sutlej River
4. Brahmaputra River Basin       :   Siang River


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Koshi River Basin is in Nepal and flows into the Ganges River system, while the Gandaki River Basin is also in Nepal and is part of the Ganges River system.  The Sutlej River is a major tributary of the Indus River, making pair 3 correct. The Siang River is a major tributary of the Brahmaputra River, making pair 4 correct.  Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 are correctly matched. Pairs 1 and 2 are incorrect because they misrepresent the river systems associated with the Koshi and Gandaki river basins.  The question tests factual recall of river systems in South Asia, and understanding of their geographical locations.  The inclusion of plausible, but incorrect, pairings (such as Ganges and Brahmaputra being linked to the wrong basins) makes the question more challenging and tests the candidate’s ability to distinguish accurate information from seemingly plausible but incorrect associations.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

Country                    Capital City
1.  Nepal                     :    Thimpu
2.  Bhutan                    :    Kathmandu
3.  Maldives                   :    Male
4.  Rwanda                    :    Kigali


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The correct capital cities are: Nepal – Kathmandu; Bhutan – Thimphu; Maldives – Malé; Rwanda – Kigali. Therefore, only pairs 3 and 4 correctly match the country with its capital city.  The incorrect pairings (Nepal with Thimphu and Bhutan with Kathmandu) represent common geographical misconceptions, making them effective distractors. The question tests factual recall of capital cities in the context of South Asian and African geography. The inclusion of plausible but incorrect capital city pairings enhances the difficulty level, requiring accurate knowledge to eliminate the incorrect options.


**3. With reference to international organizations, consider the following pairs:**

Organization                     Purpose
1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Assists high-income countries
2. Arab League                     :   Held its 2024 summit in Bahrain
3. International Seabed Authority (ISA)      :   Regulates deep-sea mining


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AIIB's primary focus is on assisting low-income countries in accessing financial resources for infrastructure development, making statement 1 incorrect. The 2024 Arab League Summit was indeed held in Bahrain, making statement 2 correct. The ISA is responsible for regulating activities related to deep-sea mining in the international seabed area, making statement 3 correct.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the functions and activities of various international organizations. The incorrect pairing of AIIB with its function serves as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge to identify the correct answer. The question tests factual recall and understanding of international organizations' roles and objectives.


**4. With reference to geographical locations, consider the following pairs:**

Location                                  Feature
1. Lake Turkana                            :   Largest freshwater lake in Africa
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                        :   Highest peak in Africa
3.  Pangong Tso                             :   Part of the Indus River basin
4.  Suez Canal                             :   Connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is the largest *permanent desert and alkaline* lake in the world, not the largest freshwater lake in Africa, making statement 1 incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the highest peak in Africa, making statement 2 correct. Pangong Tso is not a part of the Indus River basin, making statement 3 incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, making statement 4 incorrect. The question tests factual knowledge of geographical features and their characteristics.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect options (like describing Lake Turkana as a freshwater lake) makes the question more challenging and tests the examinee's ability to differentiate between similar but factually distinct descriptions.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Island/Island Group                   Disputed by
1.  Abu Musa Island                   :   Iran and UAE
2.  Senkaku Islands                   :   China and Japan
3.  Chagos Islands                    :   UK and Maldives


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Abu Musa Island is indeed disputed between Iran and the UAE, making statement 1 correct. The Senkaku Islands (Diaoyu Islands) are a subject of dispute between China and Japan, making statement 2 correct. The Chagos Islands are disputed primarily between the UK and Mauritius, not the Maldives, making statement 3 incorrect. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of territorial disputes involving islands and island groups. The incorrect pairing of Chagos Islands with Maldives serves as a strong distractor, requiring specific knowledge of the countries involved in the dispute.  The question tests factual recall of international territorial disputes and the countries involved.


**1. With reference to international initiatives focusing on infrastructure development, consider the following pairs:**

Initiative                                      Key Feature
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure in developing nations.
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative     : Led by the G20 to facilitate clean energy investment in Africa.
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Focuses primarily on sustainable agriculture practices.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022 by the G7, aims to mobilize private sector investment to support quality, inclusive, and sustainable infrastructure in developing countries.  Its ambitious target is to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027. This makes statement 1 correct. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is indeed a G7-led effort, but its aim is specifically to facilitate access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa, not sustainable agriculture or a broader infrastructure goal as stated in option 2.  Option 3 incorrectly assigns the focus of the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) to sustainable agriculture; its actual focus is on ocean conservation and sustainable maritime practices. Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.  The other pairs contain factual inaccuracies or misrepresent the initiatives' primary objectives, highlighting the importance of precise knowledge in international affairs.


**2. With reference to the Commonwealth and its relationship with India, consider the following pairs:**

Feature                                      Detail
1. India's Role in the Commonwealth       :  Represents nearly 60% of the Commonwealth’s population.
2. India's Financial Contribution          :  Is the largest financial contributor to the Commonwealth.
3. Commonwealth Initiatives in India        :  India established the Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India is indeed the largest member state of the Commonwealth, representing almost 60% of its total population. This makes statement 1 correct. However, statement 2 is incorrect; while India is a significant contributor, it is not the *largest*.  Statement 3 is correct: India did establish a Commonwealth Sub Window under the India-UN Development Fund in 2018, allocating $50 million over five years. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement about India's financial contribution serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between significant and most significant contributions within the context of international organizations.


**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its key programs, consider the following pairs:**

Program                                     Focus
1. Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) : Monitors illicit nuclear trafficking incidents globally since 1995.
2. Atoms4Food                               : Aims to improve global food security through zoonotic disease management.
3. Atoms4NetZero                            : Promotes the use of nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions.
4. Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action        : Uses nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural productivity.

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) accurately tracks illicit nuclear material trafficking incidents globally, commencing in 1995.  Atoms4NetZero is a legitimate IAEA program promoting nuclear energy for decarbonization efforts.  However, the descriptions for Atoms4Food and Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action are interchanged. Atoms4Food uses nuclear techniques to improve food security, while the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action focuses on managing zoonotic diseases, utilizing nuclear science as a tool.   Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched. The deliberate mismatching of program descriptions for Atoms4Food and Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action serves as a powerful distractor, testing the candidate's detailed knowledge of the IAEA's various programs and their specific objectives.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and its recent activities, consider the following pairs:**

Event/Initiative                                      Detail
1. 24th SCO Summit                             : Held in Astana, Kazakhstan, and Belarus joined as the 10th member.
2. SCO Cooperation Program                     : Focuses on countering terrorism, separatism, and extremism until 2027.
3.  SCO Anti-Drug Strategy                      :  Covers the period 2024-2029.
4. SCO Development Strategy                    : Extends until 2030.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2, 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3 and 4

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The 24th SCO summit was indeed held in Astana, Kazakhstan, and Belarus's accession as the 10th member state was a key outcome.  The SCO's Cooperation Program to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism covers the period 2025-2027, and the Anti-Drug Strategy runs from 2024-2029.  However, the SCO Development Strategy extends to 2035, not 2030 as stated in option 4.  Therefore, only pairs 1, 2, and 3 are correctly matched.  The incorrect timeframe for the SCO Development Strategy acts as a significant distractor, demanding precise knowledge of the organization's strategic planning horizons.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following pairs:**

Statement                                       Accuracy
1. IMEC is primarily a maritime initiative.       : True
2. IMEC will significantly enhance global connectivity. : True
3. IMEC’s primary focus is on energy security.     : False
4. IMEC is solely an initiative of India.            : False


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

While IMEC will utilize both land and sea routes, its primary focus is on enhancing connectivity, not solely maritime.  The statement that IMEC will enhance global connectivity is accurate, as it aims to create a new trade route between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  However,  IMEC is not primarily focused on energy security, and it is a multi-national initiative involving several countries, not solely India. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched.  The inclusion of plausible but ultimately incorrect statements regarding IMEC's focus and origin tests the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information and identify the core objectives of the initiative.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is an intergovernmental organization founded in 1989 on the initiative of the G7 to develop and promote policies to combat money laundering. A crucial part of its work is the Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), which assesses countries' measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, pair 1 is correctly matched.

The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is a key player in international efforts to combat drug trafficking and other forms of transnational crime. One of its many initiatives is the Global Firearms Programme (GFP), aimed at reducing illicit firearms trafficking. Hence, pair 2 is correctly matched.

GlobE (Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities) is a network focused specifically on anti-corruption efforts.  Combating transnational organized crime is a central aim of GlobE's activities.  Therefore, pair 3 is correctly matched. All three pairs are correctly matched.

1. Operation Safed Sagar               :  Indian Navy blockade of Pakistan's navy
2. Operation Talwar                    :  Indian Air Force targeting of Pakistani troops
3. Operation Vijay                     :  Recapturing Indian territories occupied by Pakistani intruders in Kargil
4. Kargil Review Committee (KRC)     : Established in 2005 to review the war
5. Kargil Vijay Diwas                  :  Observed annually on August 15th


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 3 is correctly matched. Operation Vijay was indeed launched by the Indian Army to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Kargil district. The other pairs are incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an Indian Air Force operation, not a naval one. Operation Talwar was also an IAF operation, not a naval blockade. The Kargil Review Committee was established in 1999, not 2005. Kargil Vijay Diwas is observed on July 26th, not August 15th.


**6. With reference to the weaponisation and militarisation of space, consider the following pairs:**

    Term                                   Description
1. Weaponization of space               :  Use of space to support ground, sea, and air-based military operations
2. Militarization of space               : Deployment of weapons in space, enabling conflict
3. 1967 Outer Space Treaty             :  Permits the deployment of WMDs in orbit
4. UN Security Council Resolution       :  Was not vetoed by Russia in 2024
5.  Russia                              :  Proposed a UN resolution banning all space-based weapons


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 2 is correctly matched. Militarization of space accurately refers to the deployment of weapons systems in space. The other pairs are incorrect. Weaponization of space is the deployment of weapons, not the broader support of military operations. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits, not permits, WMDs in orbit.  A UNSC resolution aimed at enforcing the 1967 treaty *was* vetoed by Russia. Russia did not propose a UN resolution; it vetoed a resolution proposed by the US and Japan.


**7. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following pairs:**

    Program/Database                     Focus
1. Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB):  Focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking.
2. Atoms4Food                            :  Promotes nuclear energy to help achieve net-zero emissions
3. Atoms4NetZero                          : Uses nuclear techniques to improve global food security.
4. International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles: Does not innovate in nuclear reactor technologies
5. Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action     : Does not integrate nuclear science in managing zoonotic diseases


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only pair 1 is correctly matched. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) does indeed monitor and report illicit nuclear trafficking. The other pairs are mismatched. Atoms4Food focuses on using nuclear techniques for improved food security, not promoting net-zero emissions (that's Atoms4NetZero). Atoms4NetZero aims at net-zero emissions through nuclear energy, not food security. The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles does indeed innovate in reactor technologies. The Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program does integrate nuclear science into managing zoonotic diseases.


**8. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), consider the following pairs:**

    Index/Initiative                     Characteristic
1. Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024:  Did not assess country-level cybersecurity commitments
2. Tier 1 Countries                     :  Demonstrate a weak commitment to cybersecurity pillars.
3. India                                 :  Not among role model countries in GCI 2024
4.  ITU                                   :  Did not release the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024
5. Expansion of digital services        :  Indicated most countries are at a high level of cybersecurity maturity.


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

None of the pairs are correctly matched. The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024 did assess country-level cybersecurity commitments. Tier 1 countries in the GCI demonstrate strong commitment. India was included among role model countries (Tier 1). The ITU did release the GCI 2024. The expansion of digital services indicated that most countries were at lower levels of cybersecurity maturity, not high.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Military Exercise           Participating Countries
1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas        :    India and the United Kingdom
2. Exercise Vajra Prahar       :    India and the United States
3. Exercise Shakti             :    India and France
4. Exercise KAZIND-2024       :    India and Kazakhstan
5. Exercise Nomadic Elephant   :    India and Mongolia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2, 3, 4, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Yudh Abhyas is an annual joint military exercise between India and the United States, not the United Kingdom.  Options (a) and (d) are therefore incorrect.  Exercises Vajra Prahar, Shakti, KAZIND-2024, and Nomadic Elephant correctly pair the participating countries as listed in the provided text. Option (b) is incorrect because it omits the correct pairing for Exercise Nomadic Elephant. Option (c) accurately reflects the correct pairings for Exercises Vajra Prahar, Shakti, KAZIND-2024, and Nomadic Elephant. The inclusion of these four exercises highlights the diverse range of India's military collaborations across different geographical regions, showcasing its strategic partnerships for enhancing defense capabilities and fostering interoperability.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Bilateral Naval Exercise      Location
1. Exercise Varuna 2024         :    Bay of Bengal
2. SIMBEX 2024                 :    Mediterranean Sea
3. JIMEX 2024                  :    Yokosuka, Japan
4. Naseem-Al-Bahr              :    Goa, India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Exercise Varuna 2024 was conducted in the Mediterranean Sea, not the Bay of Bengal.  Therefore, option (a) and (d) are incorrect. SIMBEX 2024 is a Singapore-India maritime exercise, and its location is not specified in the given text. However, JIMEX 2024 and Naseem-Al-Bahr are correctly matched with their respective locations. Option (c) is incorrect since it excludes the correct pairing of Naseem-Al-Bahr.  Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings for JIMEX 2024 and Naseem-Al-Bahr. The exercises highlight the growing importance of maritime security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region, underscoring the strategic partnerships forged to address shared maritime challenges.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Multilateral Exercise       Primary Focus
1. IBSAMAR VIII               :   Counter-terrorism
2. RIMPAC Exercise            :    Disaster Relief
3. Exercise Cutlass Express    :    Maritime Security
4. Exercise Orion              :    Peacekeeping


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise among Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies, but its primary focus is not explicitly stated as counter-terrorism in the provided text. RIMPAC's primary focus is not disaster relief; it is a large-scale maritime exercise.  Exercise Cutlass Express is indeed a multinational maritime exercise focusing on maritime security. Exercise Orion, while a multinational exercise, doesn't have peacekeeping as its primary stated focus. Option (a), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect. Option (b) is correct because only Exercise Cutlass Express is correctly paired with its primary focus of maritime security. This highlights the importance of multilateral naval collaborations in addressing shared maritime security concerns in strategically important regions.



**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization              Key Characteristic
1. AUKUS                     :   Formal military alliance like NATO
2. QUAD                      :   Focus on countering China's influence in the South China Sea
3. SQUAD                     :   Involves US, Australia, Philippines, and Japan
4.  National Security Council (NSC) :  Headed by the Minister of Defence


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

AUKUS is not a formal military alliance like NATO; it's a framework for advancing defense technologies.  QUAD's focus is broader than just countering China's influence in the South China Sea; it aims for a free and open Indo-Pacific. While QUAD does involve countering China's influence, this is not its sole and primary focus.  SQUAD accurately reflects its member countries. The NSC is headed by the Prime Minister, not the Minister of Defence.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are thus incorrect. Option (c) correctly identifies only the accurate pairing of SQUAD and its members. This demonstrates the complexity of Indo-Pacific security architectures and the need for careful understanding of their objectives and composition.


**5.  Consider the following pairs:**

    Port                      Significance
1. Chabahar Port              :   Located on the Bay of Bengal
2. Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal:   Part of the INSTC initiative
3.  Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor : Alternative to Suez Canal


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Chabahar Port is located on the Gulf of Oman, not the Bay of Bengal.  The Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor is a connectivity initiative, but it is not presented as an alternative to the Suez Canal in the provided text. The Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar Port is indeed part of the INSTC initiative, aiming to provide an alternative route to landlocked countries. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the mismatched information regarding Chabahar Port's location and the Chennai-Vladivostok corridor's significance. Option (b) accurately points out the correct pairing concerning the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal's role within the INSTC framework, highlighting the importance of this port in regional connectivity and trade.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Initiative                          Participating Country/Entity
1. Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) Supply Chain Council: India
2.  International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC)  :   Pakistan
3. Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)           :   Belarus
4.  Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)                 :   Myanmar


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) is a US-led initiative, and India is indeed a participant in its Supply Chain Council.  This is explicitly stated in the provided text.  Belarus recently joined the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), making statement 3 correct. The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) is an initiative involving India and several Southeast Asian nations, including Myanmar. Therefore, statement 4 is also accurate.  However, while the INSTC involves multiple countries aiming to connect Mumbai with St. Petersburg, the provided text doesn't definitively state Pakistan's participation.  The inclusion of Pakistan as a participant in the INSTC in the option is a deliberate distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between confirmed and unconfirmed participation based on the given information.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incorrect due to the mismatched inclusion of Pakistan in the INSTC. The question tests the candidate's ability to identify accurate pairings from a list containing plausible but ultimately incorrect pairings, demanding precise factual recall.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Economic Agreement/Initiative                  Key Feature/Outcome
1. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   India has a trade surplus with ASEAN
2. Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Singapore:  India is a net exporter
3.  Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and Maldives: Aims to enhance liquidity for Maldives
4.  BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) :   Operates solely through SWIFT


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 3 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The text clearly states that India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, making statement 1 incorrect.  The CECA between India and Singapore results in India being a net importer, not an exporter, thus statement 2 is also false. Statement 4 is incorrect; the BCBPI is designed as an alternative to SWIFT.  However, the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and Maldives is explicitly mentioned as aiming to help Maldives manage foreign exchange reserves and enhance liquidity, making statement 3 correct. The question tests not only factual knowledge but also the ability to identify subtle inaccuracies in seemingly plausible statements, demanding precise analysis and evaluation of economic data.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative                    Member State/Participant
1. Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC) : Sri Lanka
2.  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) :  Bhutan
3.  Group of Seven (G7)                              :   India (as an Outreach Country)
4.  East Asia Summit (EAS)                           :  Russia


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The provided text confirms Sri Lanka's membership in BIMSTEC, Bhutan's membership in SAARC, India's participation in the G7 summit as an Outreach Country, and Russia's membership in the EAS. All four statements are correct according to the given information. This question assesses factual recall of member states in various regional organizations, requiring the candidate to demonstrate knowledge of international relations and economic partnerships.  The inclusion of all correct pairs makes this a challenging question, requiring complete and accurate knowledge.


**4. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

  Country                                    Key Aspect of Cooperation
1. Bangladesh                               :   Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant
2. Maldives                                 :   Operation Neer (water assistance)
3. Singapore                               :   Project Nexus (cross-border payments)
4. Vietnam                                  :   INS Kirpan (missile corvette handover)


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly mentions the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant in the context of India-Bangladesh relations, Operation Neer in the context of India-Maldives relations, Project Nexus in the context of India-Singapore relations, and the handover of INS Kirpan to Vietnam.  All four pairs accurately reflect aspects of India's bilateral cooperation with the respective countries.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific details about India's collaborations with various nations, going beyond general knowledge to encompass specific projects and initiatives, thereby demanding a higher level of factual recall and application of knowledge.


Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions focus on pairings of organizations and their characteristics, rather than strictly person-event pairings as in the example. This is because the provided text heavily features organizations and their activities.

**1. With reference to international organizations and their initiatives, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                                  Initiative/Feature
    1. BRICS                                      :   SWIFT alternative payment system
    2. ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)               :   Focuses primarily on economic cooperation
    3. International Solar Alliance (ISA)          :   Includes only South Asian nations
    4. Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC)         :   Excludes India

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 4 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), also known as BRICS Pay, is indeed a blockchain-based payment system designed as an alternative to SWIFT for transactions within the BRICS nations.  Option 2 is incorrect because the ARF's primary focus is on political and security issues in the Asia-Pacific region. Option 3 is incorrect; the ISA has a broader global membership than just South Asian nations.  Option 4 is incorrect because the MGC explicitly includes India and five ASEAN countries.  Therefore, only pair 1 is correctly matched.


**2. With reference to regional organizations and their characteristics, consider the following pairs:**

    Organization                              Characteristic
    1. BIMSTEC                                 :   Decisions made based on unanimity
    2. SAARC                                    :   Acquired legal personality through a charter
    3. ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation             :   Includes Australia and New Zealand
    4. East Asia Summit (EAS)                    :   Leaders-led forum focusing solely on environmental issues

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

BIMSTEC decisions are indeed taken by unanimity among member states.  SAARC's dysfunctionality is noted, but the text does state that BIMSTEC acquired legal personality through its charter. Option 3 is incorrect; ASEAN Plus Three includes China, Japan, and South Korea, not Australia and New Zealand. Option 4 is incorrect; while the EAS does address environmental issues, it has a broader scope encompassing strategic, political, and economic matters.


**3.  With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following pairs:**

    Country                                 Relationship Status/Initiative
    1. Vietnam                                 :   Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) is not a part of their relationship
    2. Malaysia                               :   Elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" in 2015
    3. Bangladesh                             :   India's largest trading partner in South Asia
    4. China                                   :   Shares a fully demarcated 3,488 km border

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 3 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation does involve Vietnam.  Malaysia's relationship with India was elevated to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, but this happened in 2015, not 2016. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia.  The border between India and China is not fully demarcated. Therefore, only pairs 1 and 3 are correctly matched.


**4. With reference to international agreements and conventions, consider the following pairs:**

    Agreement/Convention                       Focus/Feature
    1. Biological Weapons Convention (1972)     :   Prohibits the use of chemical weapons
    2. Chemical Weapons Convention (1993)     :   Bans production and stockpiling of chemical weapons
    3. Rome Statute (1998)                      :   Focuses solely on war crimes
    4. ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) :   Aims to increase India's trade surplus with ASEAN

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 2 only
    (c) 2 and 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Biological Weapons Convention prohibits biological weapons, not chemical ones. The Chemical Weapons Convention accurately bans production and stockpiling. The Rome Statute covers war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers, not necessarily create a surplus for India.  Only pair 2 is correctly matched.


**5. With reference to  international financial institutions and their activities, consider the following pairs:**

    Institution                               Action/Focus
    1. Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) :   Assists only high-income countries
    2. Financial Action Task Force (FATF)       :   Conducts Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) on countries' anti-money laundering measures
    3. Universal Postal Union (UPU)             :   Is not a specialized agency of the United Nations
    4. OPEC+                                    :   Recently agreed to extend oil production cuts into 2024

    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) Only one
    (b) Only two
    (c) All three
    (d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The AIIB does assist low-income countries.  The FATF's MERs are accurately described. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations. OPEC+ did extend its oil output cuts.  Therefore, only two pairs (2 and 4) are correctly matched.


**6. With reference to India's initiatives and their goals, consider the following pairs:**

    Initiative                                Goal/Focus
    1.  Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI)  :   Treaty-based agreement
    2.  Aarogya Maitri                        :   Focuses solely on combating infectious diseases
    3.  Social Impact Fund                      :   Contributes to accelerating Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) in the Global South
    4. Global South Young Diplomat Forum     :   Aims to decrease educational opportunities for diplomats


    Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
    (a) 1 only
    (b) 1 and 2 only
    (c) 3 only
    (d) 1, 2, 3, and 4


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IPOI is a non-treaty based voluntary arrangement. Aarogya Maitri has a broader health security focus. The Social Impact Fund's goal is accurately stated. The Young Diplomat Forum aims to promote education and capacity building. Only pair 3 is correctly matched.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

    Geographic Feature                     Characteristic
1. Lake Turkana                           : Largest permanent desert lake in the world
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                       : Highest peak in Africa, not part of a mountain range
3. Lipulekh Pass                           : Situated in Kali Valley, Uttarakhand
4. Suez Canal                             : Connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Lake Turkana is indeed Africa's largest permanent desert lake and one of the largest alkaline lakes globally.  Mount Kilimanjaro holds the title of Africa's highest peak and is notably a free-standing mountain, not part of a larger range.  The Lipulekh Pass is accurately located in the Kali Valley within the Pithorgarh district of Uttarakhand. The Suez Canal correctly connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, providing a crucial maritime link. Therefore, all four pairs are correctly matched. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they omit at least one correctly matched pair.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

    International Organization/Initiative        Description/Recent Development
1.  Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)  :  Assisting low-income countries with financial resources

(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) All five
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Option (c) is correct because each pair accurately describes the act or agreement. The PMLA combats money laundering within India.  The UAPA addresses terrorist financing. The Chemical Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of chemical weapons. The Biological Weapons Convention similarly prohibits biological weapons.  Finally, the Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court.  The distractor options selectively exclude correctly matched pairs, requiring the candidate to possess a strong understanding of international and domestic legal frameworks to identify the correct option. This question tests factual recall and understanding of legal instruments.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

Country          |  Largest Trading Partner (Goods, 2023)
1. India         |   China
2. Bangladesh    |   India
3. Australia      |   China
4. Singapore     |   India
5. Maldives      |   India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 2, and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The statement correctly identifies China as India's largest trading partner in goods for 2023, reflecting the significant economic ties and trade volume between the two nations.  This is a well-established fact in international trade statistics.  Similarly, the pairing of Bangladesh and India accurately reflects the significant bilateral trade relationship, where India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh.  The pairing of Singapore and India is also correct. Singapore's status as India's largest trading partner within ASEAN and its position among India's top global trading partners are supported by trade data.  Finally, the statement correctly points out that India is a key trading partner for the Maldives.  This is due to India's significant role in providing economic assistance and infrastructure development in the Maldives. Option (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one of the correctly matched pairs.  Option (a) omits the accurate pairing of Singapore and India; option (b) omits the correct pairing of Maldives and India; and option (c) omits the correct pairing of Singapore and India. The distractors in the incorrect options are chosen to be plausible based on the general economic and geopolitical landscape of South Asia and the Indo-Pacific region, making it necessary for candidates to possess precise knowledge of the latest trade data for a correct response.

(a) 1 only
(b) 4 only
(c) 4 and 5 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c) 4 and 5 only

**Explanation:**

The correct answer is (c) because only Maldives (Male) and Nepal (Kathmandu) have their capital cities correctly paired.  The other options present several misleading pairs. Kolkata is the capital of West Bengal, India, not Bangladesh (Dhaka is the capital of Bangladesh); Sydney is a major city in Australia but not its capital (Canberra is the capital of Australia); Beijing is the capital of China, not Japan (Tokyo is the capital of Japan). These incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's precise knowledge of capital cities in the given countries.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are wrong because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of accurate factual recall in answering this question.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between major cities and capital cities, and to recall specific facts about different countries.

Option (d) is correct because the CEPA was indeed signed between India and Australia, the ACSA exists between India and Japan, and the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement is between India and Singapore.  The distractor, a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and Bangladesh, is incorrect. While both countries have various economic agreements, a specific CSA is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text. This incorrect pairing serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to identify specific agreements and their participants accurately.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete or contain incorrect pairings, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of the details of the agreements.

Option (a) is correct because the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project of India and Bangladesh; Arun III is an India-Bhutan hydropower project; and the Upper Karnali Hydropower Projects are a collaboration between India and Nepal.  The distractor, the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, is incorrectly paired with Sri Lanka. The pipeline is actually between India and Bangladesh.  The incorrect pairing serves as a strong distractor, testing the candidate's ability to recall specific energy projects and their participating countries. Options (b), (c), and (d) are wrong because they either miss correctly matched pairs or include the incorrect pairing of the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline with Sri Lanka, again emphasizing the need for precise knowledge to answer correctly.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

Geographical Feature   |   Location
1. Lake Turkana         |   Tanzania
2. Mount Kilimanjaro   |   Kenya
3. Lipulekh Pass       |   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal           |   Egypt
5. Great Barrier Reef   |   Australia

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 3 and 4 only
(b) 3, 4, and 5 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 only


**Correct Answer:** (b) 3, 4, and 5 only

**Explanation:**

Option (b) correctly identifies the locations of Lipulekh Pass (Uttarakhand, India), the Suez Canal (Egypt), and the Great Barrier Reef (Australia).  The distractors, Lake Turkana (located in Kenya and Ethiopia, not Tanzania) and Mount Kilimanjaro (located in Tanzania, not Kenya), are designed to test the candidate's precise geographical knowledge.  The incorrect pairings act as strong distractors, requiring candidates to possess detailed knowledge of geographical locations. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they include at least one incorrectly matched pair, highlighting the importance of accuracy in recalling geographical details.  The question tests the candidate's ability to recall specific geographical locations and to differentiate between closely located geographical features.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement          Key Feature/Initiative
1. MERCOSUR                                    :   Bolivia recently became a full member
2. Colombo Process                             :   India chaired its first meeting as Chair
3. FATF                                        :   Released Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) of India in 2024 assessing measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing
4. UNODC                                      :   Released World Drug Day report highlighting Cannabis as the most abused drug globally


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, and 4

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All four pairs are correctly matched.  Bolivia's recent accession to MERCOSUR is a significant development in South American regional integration.  India's chairmanship of the Colombo Process highlights its increasing role in regional cooperation in South Asia, focusing on migration management. The FATF's release of India's MER reflects the ongoing international efforts to combat financial crimes. Finally, the UNODC's World Drug Day report and its findings on global drug abuse patterns are well-documented.  Each pairing accurately reflects a specific and verifiable event or initiative associated with the respective international organization or agreement.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the pairings.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Treaty/Agreement              Specific Provision/Outcome
1.  High Seas Treaty (BBNJ Agreement)       :   Sets precise mechanisms for sustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond national jurisdictions
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)       :   Prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in conflict zones
3.  Geneva Protocol 1925                     :   Requires destruction of all chemical weapons stocks of member states within a specific timeframe
4.  UNCLOS                                     :  Divides marine areas into four zones: Territorial Sea, Contiguous Zone, Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), and the High Seas


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The High Seas Treaty (BBNJ Agreement) focuses on the sustainable use and conservation of marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) aims to completely ban chemical weapons, encompassing development, production, stockpiling, and use.  UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea) establishes the legal framework for ocean use, including the four zones mentioned.  However, the Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in war, not the destruction of stockpiles; that is a key provision of the CWC. Therefore, pair 3 is incorrectly matched. Option (b) accurately reflects the correct pairings, while other options incorrectly include pair 3.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Geographic Feature
1.  United States                           :   Mississippi River
2.  United Kingdom                          :   Pennines Mountain Range
3.  Latvia                                   :   Baltic Sea
4.  Kenya                                    :   Lake Turkana


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1, 2, and 3 only
(b) 1, 3, and 4 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Mississippi River is a major river in the United States. The Pennines are a mountain range in the United Kingdom. Latvia borders the Baltic Sea. Lake Turkana is located in Kenya. All four pairs correctly match a country with a prominent geographic feature within its borders. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Act/Law/Agreement                           Key Feature/Objective
1. Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002 :   Combats money laundering
2. Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967 :   Combats terrorist financing
3.  CAATSA                                             :   Aims to punish countries with deep engagements with Russia, North Korea, and Iran
4.  AITIGA                                             :   Aims to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) All four

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The PMLA directly addresses money laundering. The UAPA focuses on unlawful activities, including those related to terrorism financing. CAATSA (Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act) explicitly targets countries with significant ties to Russia, North Korea, and Iran. AITIGA (ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement) seeks to facilitate trade between ASEAN member states and India by lowering trade barriers. All four pairs accurately link the legislation/agreement with its primary objective or function. Therefore, all options except (d) are incorrect.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

    Event/Operation                                   Location/Feature
1. Operation Vijay                               :   Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir
2. Operation Safed Sagar                         :   Targeting Pakistani troops on high-altitude positions
3.  India-UK Technology Security Initiative (TSI)   :   Focus areas include Telecom, critical minerals, semiconductors, AI, quantum technology
4.  Combined Task Force-150 (CMF) operation     :    Seizure of drugs in Arabian Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, and 4
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Operation Vijay was indeed launched in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir. Operation Safed Sagar, a part of Operation Vijay, specifically targeted Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions. The India-UK TSI focuses on the listed critical and emerging technologies.  The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) operation did result in drug seizures in the Arabian Sea. All four pairs accurately reflect the location, feature, or objective associated with the event or operation.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are therefore incomplete and incorrect.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Geographic Feature                     Location
1. Lake Turkana                           :   Northwestern Kenya and Southwestern Ethiopia
2. Mount Kilimanjaro                       :   Tanzania, Africa
3. Lipulekh Pass                           :   Uttarakhand, India
4. Suez Canal                             :   Egypt
5. Saint Martin’s Island                    :   Bay of Bengal

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. Mount Kilimanjaro is situated in Tanzania, Africa. Lipulekh Pass is found in Uttarakhand, India. The Suez Canal is in Egypt.  Saint Martin's Island is located in the Bay of Bengal. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  A comprehensive understanding of geography is crucial for UPSC aspirants, and this question tests the ability to accurately locate significant geographical features.  The inclusion of diverse geographical features, from lakes and mountains to passes and canals, makes this a challenging yet relevant question for the exam.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Island/Island Group                     Ocean/Sea
1. Chagos Islands                         :   Indian Ocean
2. Guam Island                            :   Pacific Ocean
3. Mauritius                              :   Atlantic Ocean
4. Abu Musa Island                        :   Persian Gulf
5. Senkaku Islands                        :   East China Sea

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 4, and 5 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Chagos Islands are located in the Indian Ocean. Guam Island is situated in the Pacific Ocean. Abu Musa Island is in the Persian Gulf. The Senkaku Islands are found in the East China Sea. Mauritius is an island nation in the Indian Ocean, not the Atlantic Ocean. This question tests knowledge of island locations and their associated bodies of water, a key component of geopolitical understanding.  The inclusion of less commonly known island groups like the Chagos Islands and Senkaku Islands, along with a distractor (Mauritius), increases the difficulty level, making it suitable for a high-stakes examination like the UPSC.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                               Capital City
1. Rwanda                                 :   Kigali
2. Togo                                   :   Lomé
3. Democratic Republic of Congo          :   Kinshasa
4. Maldives                               :   Malé
5. Somalia                                :   Mogadishu

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. Kigali is the capital of Rwanda, Lomé is the capital of Togo, Kinshasa is the capital of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malé is the capital of the Maldives, and Mogadishu is the capital of Somalia.  This question assesses knowledge of capital cities across various regions of the world.  The inclusion of countries from different continents helps test a broad understanding of global geography and political systems.  The absence of any incorrect pairings makes it a question testing pure factual recall, a necessary skill for UPSC aspirants.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   River                                   Country/Region
1. Seine River                             :   France
2. Kaladan River                           :   Myanmar
3. Omo River                              :   Ethiopia
4. Murray River                            :   Australia
5.  Tapti River                             :   India

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All the pairs are correctly matched. The Seine River flows through France. The Kaladan River is in Myanmar. The Omo River is located in Ethiopia. The Murray River is in Australia. The Tapti River is found in India. This question tests knowledge of major rivers across various countries.  The selection of rivers spans different continents, testing the candidate's geographical awareness on a global scale. The straightforward nature of the correct matches emphasizes the importance of basic geographical knowledge in the UPSC examination.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                 Bordering Country/Water Body
1. Latvia                                  :   Baltic Sea
2. Philippines                            :   South China Sea
3.  India                                   :   Bay of Bengal
4.  Bangladesh                            :   Bay of Bengal
5.  Indonesia                             :   Philippine Sea


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
(d) 2 and 4 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Latvia borders the Baltic Sea. The Philippines shares borders with the South China Sea. India borders the Bay of Bengal. Bangladesh also borders the Bay of Bengal. Indonesia is bordered by the Philippine Sea.  This question tests knowledge of countries and their bordering geographical features.  The variety of countries and geographical features ensures that the question tests a broad understanding of global geography and its relevance to international relations. The correct matching of all pairs highlights the significance of detailed geographical knowledge for UPSC preparation.



**6. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization               Program/Initiative
1. IAEA                                    :   Atoms4Food
2. ITU                                     :   Global Cybersecurity Index
3.  UNESCO                                  :   World Food Programme
4.  CMF                                    :   Operation Crimson Barracuda
5.  World Bank                             :  Greater Male Connectivity Project

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA runs the Atoms4Food program.  The ITU releases the Global Cybersecurity Index. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) conducted Operation Crimson Barracuda. However, UNESCO does not directly run the World Food Programme (WFP) – WFP is a separate UN agency.  The World Bank is not directly involved in the Greater Male Connectivity Project (though it may provide funding or support).  This question assesses knowledge of international organizations and their key programs. The inclusion of both well-known and lesser-known programs increases the difficulty, testing in-depth knowledge of international affairs.  The incorrect pairings serve as effective distractors, requiring candidates to carefully consider each option.




**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                      Focus Area
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Sustainable agriculture
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative          : Clean energy projects in Africa
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) : Sustainable port infrastructure
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to mobilize funding for sustainable, inclusive, and quality infrastructure projects in developing nations.  It does *not* primarily focus on sustainable agriculture.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, a G7-led effort, explicitly targets facilitating external investment for clean energy projects across the African continent. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is concerned with ocean health and sustainability, it is not directly related to sustainable port infrastructure. While sustainable port development might be a component of broader sustainability efforts, the primary focus of FSOI lies elsewhere.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the initiative's focus.  The inclusion of sustainable agriculture and sustainable port infrastructure as distractors tests the candidate's precise knowledge of these initiatives and prevents superficial answers.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement         Key Objective/Feature
1.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF)          : Combating drug trafficking
2.  Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC)        : Eliminating chemical weapons
3.  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) :  Improving global food security through nuclear techniques (Atoms4Food)
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) primarily focuses on combating money laundering and terrorist financing, not drug trafficking, although drug trafficking may be indirectly related to financial crimes. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) has the explicit goal of eliminating chemical weapons worldwide through the destruction of stockpiles and prevention of future production. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) does have a program called Atoms4Food which uses nuclear techniques to enhance global food security. Therefore, only pairs 2 and 3 are correctly matched. Option (a) is incorrect because the FATF's main focus is not drug trafficking. Option (c) is incorrect because it omits the correctly matched pair related to the CWC and IAEA.  Option (d) is incorrect because it includes the incorrectly matched pair concerning the FATF.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Initiative     Specific Activity/Role of India
1.  India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC)  :  A cornerstone of global connectivity
2.  Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO)             :  Fourth-largest contributor
3.  Group of Seven (G7)                             :  Invited as an Outreach Country
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?

(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is indeed envisioned as a crucial element in enhancing global connectivity, connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe.  India's role in the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is significant, but it is not the fourth-largest contributor; that position belongs to another member. India's participation in the Group of Seven (G7) summit as an Outreach Country is a well-documented fact.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the given roles of India.  The inclusion of the inaccurate statement about India's contribution to the SCO serves as a crucial distractor, testing the candidate's specific knowledge rather than allowing for general assumptions.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Treaty/Convention                                      Key Provision/Objective
1.  Geneva Protocol 1925                             :  Prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons
2.  Biological Weapons Convention (1972)              :  Bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons
3.  Rome Statute for International Criminal Court (ICC) : Established the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Geneva Protocol of 1925 correctly prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, *not* chemical weapons (that's the CWC). The Rome Statute of 1998 correctly established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the provisions/objectives of the respective treaties/conventions.  The inclusion of an incorrect statement regarding the Biological Weapons Convention serves as a strong distractor, requiring precise knowledge of international law.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Regional Organization/Initiative                     Key Feature/Outcome
1. Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC): Acquired legal personality after the BIMSTEC Charter came into force
2.  South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC):  Has been largely dysfunctional since 2016
3.  Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN):  India became a Dialogue Partner in 1996
Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The BIMSTEC Charter coming into force, granting the organization legal personality, is a significant development. The decline in the functionality of SAARC since 2016 is a widely acknowledged fact.  India's status as a Dialogue Partner in ASEAN since 1996 is also accurate. Therefore, all three statements are correctly matched. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of regional organizations and their evolution, requiring familiarity with key events and their significance.  The options are designed to make the candidate carefully consider each pair.


**1. Consider the following pairs:**

   Initiative                                    Focus Area
1. Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) : Sustainable agriculture
2. Energy for Growth in Africa initiative      : Clean energy projects in Africa
3. G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) :  Combating terrorism
4. G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition                  : Infrastructure development in developing nations

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Energy for Growth in Africa initiative is explicitly focused on facilitating access to external investment for clean energy projects in Africa.  This directly aligns with the description provided in the source text. Option (d) is partially correct as PGII focuses on infrastructure development in developing nations, but it's not its *sole* focus. The PGII aims for sustainable, inclusive, and quality infrastructure. Sustainable agriculture is not a primary focus of the PGII.  Option (a) is incorrect because PGII's focus is broader than sustainable agriculture. Option (c) is incorrect; FSOI relates to oceans and seas, not combating terrorism. The G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition aims to control oil prices, not infrastructure development. Therefore, only option (b) accurately reflects the initiative's primary focus.  Understanding the nuances of each initiative's goals is crucial for correct matching, highlighting the importance of detailed comprehension in UPSC-style questions.


**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Organization                                   Key Feature/Initiative
1.  Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)                 :  Advocates for Cuba's removal from US terrorism list
2.  Commonwealth                               :  Largest member is Australia
3.  International Narcotics Control Board (INCB) :  Focuses primarily on countering money laundering
4.  Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ) :  Launched the "Generation Justice" initiative

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 4 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 4 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The NAM's stance on Cuba's removal from the US terrorism list is a prominent recent event. The CCPCJ's launch of the "Generation Justice" initiative is also accurately stated.  Option (b) is incorrect because the Commonwealth's largest member by population is India, not Australia.  Option (c) incorrectly includes statement 2. Option (d) is incorrect because INCB's focus is on drug control, not money laundering. This question tests the candidate's knowledge of international organizations and their current activities, a recurring theme in UPSC examinations. The ability to distinguish between the core functions of different international bodies is key to answering this question correctly.



**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization/Agreement           Characteristic
1.  BIMSTEC Charter                             :  Came into force in 2023
2.  ASEAN+3                                     :  Includes Russia as a member

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 4 only
(d) 1, 3, and 4 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The statement about IMEC being a cornerstone of global connectivity is directly supported by the provided text.  Option (a) is incorrect; the BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2024, not 2023.  Option (c) is incorrect; ASEAN+3 does not include Russia.  Option (d) is incorrect because Belarus joined as the 10th member, not 9th. This question assesses factual recall and the ability to differentiate between similar international organizations and initiatives.  Precision in recalling details is crucial for success in the UPSC examination.


**4. Consider the following pairs:**

   Agreement/Initiative                         Key Aspect
1.  Supply Chain Council under IPEF             :   Focuses on labor rights
2.  India-GCC Joint Action Plan 2024-2028     :   Governs the relationship between India and the G7
3.  SAARC Currency Swap Framework 2024-2027 :   Facilitates currency exchange between SAARC nations
4.  Technology Security Initiative (TSI) India-UK :   Primarily focuses on telecommunications


Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 and 4 only
(c) 1, 3, and 4 only
(d) Only 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The SAARC Currency Swap Framework is accurately described as facilitating currency exchange. Options 1, 2, and 4 are incorrect. The Supply Chain Council under IPEF focuses on strengthening critical supply chains, not solely labor rights. The India-GCC Joint Action Plan deals with India and the GCC, not the G7. While telecommunications is a part of the TSI, it's not the *primary* focus.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of different economic and trade agreements, requiring precise knowledge of their core objectives.  The inclusion of plausible but incorrect distractors makes this a challenging question, reflecting the difficulty level often seen in UPSC exams.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's ITDB monitors illicit nuclear material trafficking, SIPRI's report ranks countries by military spending, and the ITU's GCI assesses cybersecurity capabilities.  Option (a) is incorrect; the UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy does not primarily focus on humanitarian aid. Option (c) is also incorrect; it misses the accurate pairing of the ITU's GCI. Option (d) is incomplete, omitting correct pairings. This question assesses knowledge of various international bodies and their functions, demanding precise recall and understanding of their roles in global affairs. This kind of question tests the candidate's ability to synthesize information from different sources and apply it to specific scenarios.

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has a stated objective of cooperation to counter terrorism, separatism, and extremism, validating pair 3. Therefore, all three pairs are correctly matched.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they omit at least one correctly matched pair.  The question tests factual recall of the objectives and activities of various international organizations and initiatives, a crucial aspect of UPSC preparation requiring precise knowledge of global economic and political landscapes.



**2. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                 Economic Initiative/Agreement
1. India                                     :   Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council
2. Bangladesh                             :   Member of Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India's role as Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council is explicitly stated, making pair 1 correct.  Bangladesh's participation in the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative is also confirmed, validating pair 2. The launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives in collaboration with India is factual, thus confirming pair 3.  All three pairs represent accurate pairings of countries and their respective economic engagements. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.  This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of recent economic developments and partnerships involving India and its neighbors in the Indo-Pacific region, emphasizing the importance of regional cooperation and economic integration.


**3. Consider the following pairs:**

   International Organization                Key Programme/Initiative
1. International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA): Atoms4NetZero
2. International Telecommunication Union (ITU): Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)
3. Group of Seven (G7)                     :   BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI)

Which of the pairs given above is/are correctly matched?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero program promotes nuclear energy for net-zero emissions, making pair 1 correct. The ITU released the Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI), correctly matching pair 2. However, the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) is associated with BRICS nations, not the G7, making pair 3 incorrect.  Therefore, only pairs 1 and 2 are correctly matched. Options (a), (c), and (d) are incorrect due to the misattribution of the BCBPI to the G7. The question tests the knowledge of key initiatives and programs undertaken by prominent international organizations, highlighting the importance of understanding their roles in global affairs.  It assesses the candidate's ability to differentiate between similar-sounding initiatives and correctly associate them with the respective organizations.

The SAARC Currency Swap Framework aims to enhance liquidity and stabilize exchange rates within the South Asian region, validating pair 2. The Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) conduct operations, including drug seizures in the Arabian Sea, as highlighted by Operation Crimson Barracuda, thus confirming pair 3. All three pairs accurately reflect the features and objectives of the respective agreements and initiatives. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect as they exclude at least one correctly matched pair.  This question tests the candidate's understanding of regional economic and security cooperation in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific, requiring knowledge of specific agreements and their operational aspects.


**5. Consider the following pairs:**

   Country                                  Bilateral Initiative/Agreement with India

Nepal, India, and Bangladesh have signed a pact to facilitate cross-border electricity trade, validating pair 3.  Consequently, all three pairs represent accurate bilateral initiatives or agreements between India and the specified countries. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incorrect because they exclude at least one accurate pairing. This question assesses the candidate's knowledge of India's bilateral relations with specific countries, focusing on recent economic and diplomatic engagements.  It demands precise knowledge of specific agreements and events, testing recall and understanding of international relations.
