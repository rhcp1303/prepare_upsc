The SCO's "Initiative on World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development" aims for a more holistic approach, encompassing peace, harmony, and development, not solely focusing on economic aspects.


**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Group of Seven (G7):**

1.  The G7 operates with a permanent secretariat and a fixed annual budget.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is primarily focused on funding infrastructure projects within G7 nations.
3.  India's participation in the G7 summit in Italy was as a full member.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the agenda annually.  It doesn't have a fixed secretariat or budget like many other international organizations. Statement 2 is incorrect. The PGII aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing countries, not solely within the G7 nations. This initiative reflects the G7's commitment to supporting global infrastructure development. Statement 3 is also incorrect. India participated as an Outreach Country, not a full member.  Outreach countries are invited to participate in certain G7 events and discussions but don't have the same voting rights or decision-making power as full members.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents within a single specific region.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program focuses solely on increasing crop yields through the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
3.  The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes the use of nuclear energy as a means of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's ITDB monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking globally, not within a single region.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While increasing crop yields is an objective, the Atoms4Food program utilizes various nuclear techniques, not solely relying on GMOs.  It employs methods like isotopic tracing and radiation mutation breeding to improve crop production, addressing food security challenges. Statement 3 is correct. The Atoms4NetZero initiative directly promotes the use of nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source to help countries achieve net-zero emissions targets.  This initiative highlights the IAEA's role in addressing climate change.


**6. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA was signed in 2009 with the objective to reduce trade barriers between ASEAN and India.
2.  India currently enjoys a significant trade surplus with ASEAN under AITIGA.
3.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA focused on completely abolishing tariffs between ASEAN and India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AITIGA was signed in 2009 and aims to reduce or eliminate trade barriers to deepen economic ties between India and ASEAN member states. Statement 2 is incorrect. India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus. This trade imbalance is a continuing challenge for India's trade relations with the region. Statement 3 is incorrect. While the 5th Joint Committee Meeting reviewed AITIGA's progress, the goal isn't the complete abolition of all tariffs immediately.  Trade liberalization under AITIGA is a gradual process, and the meeting likely focused on further progress in reducing trade barriers and enhancing economic cooperation.



**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC):**

1.  The RBI's SAARC Currency Swap Framework for 2024-2027 is designed to address balance-of-payments crises among SAARC member states.
2.  SAARC decisions are made based on a simple majority vote.
3.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) Agreement aims to promote regional economic integration within South Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The SAARC Currency Swap Framework facilitates liquidity support, which can indirectly help member states facing balance-of-payment issues but isn't the sole purpose.  The framework primarily aims to enhance regional financial cooperation and stability. Statement 2 is incorrect. SAARC decisions require unanimity among all member states. This consensus-based decision-making process often slows down progress but reflects the organization's emphasis on accommodating the diverse interests of its members. Statement 3 is correct. The SAFTA Agreement is a cornerstone of SAARC's efforts to promote regional economic integration through reduced trade barriers and enhanced market access among South Asian countries.


**8. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1.  The INCB is an agency of the United Nations.
2.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is for a five-year term.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1, 2 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The INCB is a treaty-based international organization operating under the auspices of the UN and is responsible for monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The re-election is for a six-year term (2025-2030), not five years.  The term length is important for understanding the continuity of leadership within the INCB. Statement 3 is correct. The INCB's core mandate is to monitor the implementation of international drug control conventions, to work towards reducing the global impact of illicit drug production and trafficking and to promote international cooperation in this area.


**9. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF.
2.  The CMF is a multinational coalition focused solely on counter-terrorism operations.
3.  The CMF operates primarily in the Mediterranean Sea.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage explicitly states that Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first such operation by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF in 2022. Statement 2 is incorrect. While counter-terrorism is a key focus, the CMF's mandate is broader, encompassing maritime security operations, including counter-piracy, drug interdiction, and other threats to maritime stability. Statement 3 is incorrect.  The CMF operates across multiple regions, including the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and other areas crucial for global maritime security.  The CMF's area of operations is not confined to the Mediterranean Sea.


**10.  Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF assesses its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2.  The FATF is an agency of the United Nations.
3.  India's first MER was adopted in 2020.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The FATF's MERs comprehensively evaluate a country's efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. This evaluation helps identify areas for improvement in a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime. Statement 2 is incorrect. The FATF is an inter-governmental organization, not a UN agency. It operates independently, though it collaborates with various UN bodies and other international organizations.  Statement 3 is incorrect. India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2020.  The timeline is important for understanding the evolution of India's AML/CFT framework and its engagement with the FATF.




**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybercrime.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and  includes legislative frameworks such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) are key institutions involved in India's anti-money laundering efforts,  both established after 2000.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the FATF's MER explicitly includes the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction as a key area of assessment.  While cybercrime is a growing concern and addressed by other international bodies, it's not a primary focus of the FATF's MER.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010, and the PMLA, 2002, and UAPA, 1967, are core components of its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing framework.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the FIU-IND and ED are crucial in India's anti-money laundering efforts, the ED was established much earlier than 2000; it was established in 1956.  The FIU-IND was established in 2004. This inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.  The question tests the precise knowledge of establishment dates, highlighting the importance of detailed factual recall in UPSC-style questions.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report highlights cannabis as the least abused drug globally, with opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy following in that order of prevalence.
2. The report identifies the Golden Triangle (now renamed the Death Triangle) – comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand – and the Golden Crescent (now renamed the Death Crescent) – encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran – as regions significantly affected by drug abuse.
3. The report notes that cannabis legalization has been implemented in Canada, Uruguay, and only 10 US jurisdictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The report actually identifies cannabis as the *most* abused drug globally, contradicting the statement's claim.  This highlights the importance of precise factual recall.

Statement 2 is correct. The report does indeed highlight the Death Triangle and Death Crescent as regions heavily impacted by drug abuse. The renaming is also accurately reflected.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The report mentions that cannabis has been legalized in far more than 10 US jurisdictions; the actual number is 27.  This again underscores the need for precise factual knowledge in answering UPSC-style questions.  The close-but-incorrect number in the statement acts as a strong distractor.


**3. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CCPCJ's 33rd Session focused solely on combating cybercrime and data breaches.
2. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention),  is not ratified by India.
3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for UNTOC and has launched initiatives such as the Transnational Organized Crime Threat Assessment (TOCTA) and the Global Firearms Programme (GFP).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 33rd Session did address transnational organized crime, it did not focus *solely* on cybercrime and data breaches. The session had a broader scope encompassing various aspects of crime prevention and criminal justice.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage clearly states that India *has* ratified the UNTOC, 2000 (Palermo Convention).  This is a crucial detail, demonstrating the importance of accurate factual knowledge.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNODC's role as the secretariat for UNTOC and its initiatives, TOCTA and GFP, are accurately described in the provided text.

2. Under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement, three bodies were established: a Supply Chain Council, a Crisis Response Network, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board.
3. The IPEF includes ASEAN members, Australia, China, Japan, India, New Zealand, South Korea, Russia, and the US, but excludes Canada.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India was elected *Vice-Chair*, not the chair, of the IPEF’s Supply Chain Council.  This subtle difference demonstrates the importance of precise language comprehension.

Statement 2 is correct. The three bodies mentioned – the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board – are accurately described as established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the IPEF does include most of the members listed, Canada is a participant.  The omission of Canada in the statement makes it incorrect.  This acts as a strong distractor, testing the examinee's comprehensive knowledge of IPEF membership.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus is the ninth member to join the SCO.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The passage states Belarus became the *tenth* member, not the ninth.  This small numerical discrepancy tests the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The adoption of the Cooperation Program and the Anti-Drug Strategy are accurately reported in the provided text.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the SCO Development Strategy *was* endorsed, not rejected.  This highlights the importance of carefully reading and interpreting the provided information.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**  Statement 1 is incorrect because the IPEF's Supply Chain Council's focus extends beyond technological advancements to encompass the strengthening of critical supply chains as a whole.  Statement 2 is incorrect as the Crisis Response Network is designed for collective, multilateral emergency responses, not just bilateral ones.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the IPEF Labor Rights Advisory Board explicitly brings together workers, employers, and governments to promote labor rights and workforce development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate.  Statement 1 is partially correct in that the PGII aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, but its focus is broader than just renewable energy in sub-Saharan Africa; it encompasses sustainable, inclusive, and quality infrastructure across developing nations.  Statement 2 is incorrect because the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is not limited to solar energy; it facilitates access to external investment for various clean energy projects. Statement 3 is inaccurate as the FSOI's scope extends beyond sustainable fishing and combating illegal fishing in the Pacific; it addresses broader ocean health and sustainability concerns globally.  The statements contain misleading information, making them difficult to answer correctly without a deep understanding of each initiative.

The call for Cuba's removal reflects its commitment to supporting developing countries against perceived unfair treatment. Statement 2 is incorrect as the US's unilateral measures against countries on the list extend beyond economic sanctions to include commercial and financial restrictions.  The question uses misleading language about NAM's priorities and the scope of US sanctions to test the candidate's knowledge.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct.  The IMEC aims to improve connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, not just India and the EU.  While it may indirectly reduce reliance on the Suez Canal by offering alternative routes, it is not explicitly designed to do so. The provided text doesn't specify when the IMEC was announced.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC):**

1. IMEC aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, primarily focusing on maritime routes.
2.  IMEC is envisioned as a key component of India's overall strategy to diversify its trade and reduce reliance on traditional routes.
3. The IMEC initiative is entirely funded by the Indian government and does not involve collaborations with international organizations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) is a crucial initiative aimed at strengthening connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe.  While the exact details of the project's implementation are still evolving, its core objective is to bolster trade and economic relations through improved connectivity. Statement 1 is largely correct; though IMEC likely incorporates various modes of transport, maritime routes are anticipated to be a significant component.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the strategic implications of IMEC for India's broader economic strategy.  Diversifying trade routes and reducing dependence on traditional channels is a key goal of the initiative. Statement 3, however, is incorrect.  Such large-scale infrastructure projects often necessitate international collaboration and funding from various sources, including multilateral development banks and private sector investment. The Indian government's role is significant, but it's unlikely to be the sole funder.  Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they either exclude or misrepresent key aspects of the IMEC project.


**2. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and joint military operations among member states.
2. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO significantly expands the organization's geographic reach into Eastern Europe.
3. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 primarily focuses on economic cooperation and trade liberalization amongst its member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) is a Eurasian political, economic, and security alliance. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While security cooperation is a significant aspect of the SCO, its mandate extends far beyond purely military alliances and joint military operations.  The organization focuses on a broad range of issues, including economic cooperation, cultural exchange, and counter-terrorism efforts. Statement 2 is correct. Belarus's inclusion marks a notable expansion of the SCO's influence into Eastern Europe, adding a new dimension to its geopolitical reach. Statement 3 is partially true but oversimplified.  While economic cooperation is a part of the SCO's 2035 strategy, the strategy is much broader and involves multiple dimensions.  It encompasses political, security, and cultural aspects in addition to economic elements.  Therefore, only statement 2 is completely accurate, making (b) the correct choice. The other options incorrectly represent the SCO's multifaceted nature and goals.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) is a significant trade pact. Statement 1 is partially incorrect.  AITIGA aimed to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties, but it didn't completely eliminate all tariffs and barriers immediately.  The agreement involved a phased reduction of tariffs and other trade restrictions over a period of time. Statement 2 is incorrect.  India has consistently reported a trade deficit with ASEAN countries, indicating that imports from ASEAN exceed exports to the region.  This is a recurring issue discussed in the context of AITIGA's review. Statement 3 is correct.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting indeed took place and focused on reviewing the agreement's performance and identifying areas for improvement to enhance trade relations further.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other options misrepresent key facts about AITIGA's objectives and the current state of India-ASEAN trade relations.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is a G7 initiative focused solely on funding infrastructure projects in Africa.
3. India's participation in the G7 summit as an outreach country indicates growing collaboration on global issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The Group of Seven (G7) is an intergovernmental political forum. Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent secretariat and a fixed annual budget. Its structure is informal, with the presidency rotating annually among member states, setting the agenda for each year.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PGII is a G7 initiative aiming to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations, its scope is not limited to Africa. It encompasses a broader range of countries across the globe. Statement 3 is correct. India's consistent invitation to the G7 summits as an outreach country reflects increasing cooperation and collaboration on various global issues, signaling a growing convergence of interests and a desire for coordinated action.  Therefore, only statement 3 is completely accurate.  The other options contain misleading or inaccurate information about the G7's organizational structure and the PGII initiative.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the International Solar Alliance (ISA):**

1. The ISA's membership is exclusively limited to countries located within the tropics.
2.  The ISA focuses solely on promoting solar energy technology and does not address broader energy access issues.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

The International Solar Alliance (ISA) is an intergovernmental organization to promote solar energy. Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ISA's focus is on solar energy, its membership is not strictly limited to countries located within the tropics. Countries beyond the tropics can also join and participate in the alliance's initiatives. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The ISA's mandate extends beyond simply promoting solar energy technology.  It also aims to address broader energy access challenges, particularly in developing countries, by facilitating the deployment of solar power and related technologies to improve energy security and sustainability. Statement 3 is correct. The ISA has indeed attracted a substantial number of member countries, exceeding 100, demonstrating the growing global interest in solar energy and sustainable development.  Consequently, only statement 3 is accurate. The other options include inaccurate information about the ISA's membership criteria and its broader objectives.


**6. With reference to the India-Vietnam relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The bilateral relationship between India and Vietnam is characterized solely by economic cooperation and trade agreements.
2.  India and Vietnam conduct joint military exercises, indicating a strong defense partnership.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

India and Vietnam share a multifaceted relationship encompassing various aspects. Statement 1 is incorrect.  While economic cooperation and trade agreements are important components of India-Vietnam relations, the partnership extends significantly beyond that.  The two countries engage in cooperation in areas such as defence, security, and cultural exchange. Statement 2 is correct.  India and Vietnam actively participate in joint military exercises, such as PASSEX, VINBAX, and MILAN, which highlight their strong defence cooperation and strategic partnership. Statement 3 is incorrect. The Mekong-Ganga Cooperation (MGC) is a broader initiative involving India and five ASEAN countries (Cambodia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam).  It is not exclusively limited to India and Vietnam.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate. The other options include inaccurate or incomplete information about the range of cooperation between India and Vietnam.


**7. With reference to the India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Malaysia is among India's top five trading partners globally.
2.  The Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA) between India and Malaysia has led to a significant trade surplus for India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

India and Malaysia maintain a significant bilateral relationship. Statement 1 is incorrect. While Malaysia is an important trading partner for India, it's not consistently ranked among India's top five trading partners globally. The ranking fluctuates depending on various factors. Statement 2 is incorrect.  The CECA between India and Malaysia hasn't resulted in a significant trade surplus for India.  India often reports a trade deficit with Malaysia due to imports exceeding exports. Statement 3 is correct.  India and Malaysia actively engage in defence cooperation, with mechanisms such as the Malaysia-India Defence Cooperation Committee (MIDCOM) playing a key role in reviewing progress and coordinating joint activities. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other options misrepresent the current state of India-Malaysia trade relations and the ranking of Malaysia among India's trading partners.


**8. Consider the following statements regarding the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC):**

1. The GCC is an economic and political alliance comprising countries exclusively from the Arabian Peninsula.
2.  India maintains strong economic ties with the GCC, making it a significant trading partner.
3.  India's remittances from the GCC countries are negligible due to stringent immigration policies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is a regional intergovernmental organization. Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The GCC includes countries from the Arabian Peninsula, but its membership also extends beyond the strict geographical boundaries of the peninsula. Statement 2 is correct. India's economic ties with the GCC are substantial, making the GCC one of India's largest trading partners.  Significant trade and investment flows exist between India and GCC member states. Statement 3 is incorrect. Remittances from GCC countries to India are substantial and contribute significantly to India's economy.  A large Indian diaspora resides in GCC countries, sending remittances back home. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate. The other options include misleading or factually incorrect information about the GCC's composition and India's economic relations with the region.


**9. With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), consider the following statements:**

1. NATO's membership is exclusively limited to European countries.
2.  NATO's primary function is to conduct military interventions globally, regardless of its members' interests.
3.  Sweden's recent accession to NATO has expanded the organization's geographic reach.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is an intergovernmental military alliance. Statement 1 is incorrect.  NATO's membership is not exclusively limited to European countries. It includes North American countries like the United States and Canada. Statement 2 is incorrect.  NATO's primary function is not to conduct military interventions globally without regard to its members' interests.  Its actions are based on collective security principles and involve consultations and decisions among its member states.  Military interventions are undertaken within the framework of its collective defense mandate. Statement 3 is correct.  Sweden's recent accession to NATO has indeed expanded the organization's geographic reach, adding a significant Nordic member.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate. The other options include inaccurate or misleading information about NATO's membership and its operational principles.



**1. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The Quad's "Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI)" aims to enhance maritime domain awareness solely through the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (2022).
2. The Quad's "Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission," scheduled for 2025, is primarily focused on improving interoperability among its member navies and not on maritime safety.
3. The 2025 Quad Leaders’ Summit will be hosted by Japan, marking 20 years of Quad cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because MAITRI leverages tools from the 2022 Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness and other Quad initiatives, not solely relying on the 2022 initiative.  The statement misrepresents the scope of MAITRI by limiting its focus to a single initiative.  The initiative is broader, integrating various existing tools and resources for a comprehensive approach to maritime domain awareness.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the "Quad-at-Sea Ship Observer Mission" aims to improve both interoperability and maritime safety. The statement falsely separates these two key objectives, implying that one is prioritized over the other.  Both are integral components of the mission's overall goals.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India will host the 2025 Quad Leaders’ Summit, not Japan. The statement incorrectly attributes the hosting responsibility to Japan.  This factual inaccuracy undermines the credibility of the statement.


**2. With reference to the AUKUS agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. AUKUS is a formal military alliance similar to NATO, primarily focused on collective defense against China.
2. The Exchange of Naval Nuclear Propulsion Information Agreement (ENNPIA), signed in 2021, facilitates the sharing of non-critical defense technologies among AUKUS members.
3. AUKUS aims to counter China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region through advancements in defense technologies, not solely through military alliances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AUKUS is explicitly not a formal military alliance like NATO.  The statement mischaracterizes the nature of AUKUS, confusing its focus on technology sharing with a traditional military alliance structure.  AUKUS operates under a different framework than NATO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. ENNPIA facilitates the sharing of *critical* naval nuclear propulsion information, a highly sensitive area of technology, not non-critical technologies. The statement downplays the significance of the agreement by misrepresenting the type of technology shared. It is a legally binding agreement focusing on advanced, sensitive technologies.

Statement 3 is correct. AUKUS aims to counter China's influence through technological advancement in defense capabilities. This is the core objective of the agreement, working outside of the traditional military alliance structure.


**3. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The 10-year agreement signed between India and Iran for the development of Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal bypasses the need for the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC).
2. Chabahar Port's geostrategic location on the Gulf of Oman facilitates direct sea routes to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan, and enhances connectivity to Central Asia.
3. The development of Chabahar Port primarily aims to strengthen India-Iran relations and does not significantly impact connectivity with Central Asian nations or the INSTC initiative.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The development of Chabahar Port is complementary to, not a replacement for, the INSTC.  The port serves as a crucial node within the broader INSTC network, enhancing its overall efficiency and reach. The statement incorrectly presents them as mutually exclusive projects.

Statement 2 is correct. Chabahar Port's location provides a direct sea route to Afghanistan, avoiding Pakistan, and significantly improves connectivity with Central Asian countries.  The statement accurately highlights the port's strategic importance for regional connectivity.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While strengthening India-Iran relations is a significant outcome, the port's development also greatly impacts connectivity with Central Asia and aligns with the INSTC initiative, which is a key aspect of its strategic significance. The statement understates the broader geopolitical implications of the project.


**4. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC, established in 2000, connects India with Russia and Europe through Iran and Central Asia, utilizing only sea routes.
2. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multimodal transportation network, primarily aimed at reducing transportation time and costs between India and Europe.
3.  The development of Chabahar Port significantly enhances the functionality and efficiency of the INSTC by providing a crucial link to Central Asia and Afghanistan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INSTC is a multimodal transportation network, utilizing sea, rail, and road routes, not solely sea routes. The statement inaccurately describes the INSTC's mode of transportation, omitting the crucial role of rail and road networks.

Statement 2 is correct. The INSTC's main objective is to improve the efficiency and reduce the cost of transportation between India and Europe by providing an alternative route to the Suez Canal. The statement accurately reflects the INSTC's primary goal.

Statement 3 is correct. Chabahar Port is a key component of the INSTC, significantly improving its access to Central Asia and Afghanistan. The statement correctly identifies the synergistic relationship between Chabahar Port and the INSTC.


**5. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, grants BIMSTEC the status of an intergovernmental organization but not a legal personality.

3. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a significant project under the BIMSTEC framework, aimed at improving regional connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC Charter, which came into force in May 2024, grants BIMSTEC "legal personality," not just intergovernmental organization status.  The statement misrepresents a key aspect of the Charter's impact on BIMSTEC's legal standing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Science, technology, and innovation are included among BIMSTEC's seven focus areas. The statement omits a crucial area of BIMSTEC's focus, demonstrating a lack of complete knowledge about its operational areas.

Statement 3 is correct. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a major project under BIMSTEC aimed at improving regional connectivity. The statement accurately identifies a significant initiative within the BIMSTEC framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India maintains strategic partnerships with Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Oman, but not all six GCC countries. The statement overstates the extent of India's strategic partnerships within the GCC.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GCC is India's largest trading partner bloc, India has a trade *deficit*, not a surplus, with GCC countries. The statement misrepresents the nature of India's trade balance with the GCC.

Statement 3 is correct. A substantial portion of India's total remittances originates from GCC countries, reflecting the significant NRI population in the region.  The statement accurately reflects the economic significance of the NRI population in the GCC for India.

3.  The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) poses a potential challenge to India-US relations, particularly regarding India's engagement with certain countries.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The designation of India as a Major Defence Partner in 2016 significantly boosted both arms sales and defence industrial cooperation between the two nations. The statement inaccurately isolates one aspect of the impact while ignoring another crucial element.

Statement 2 is incorrect. LEMOA facilitates logistical support and not the sharing of critical defense technologies. The statement confuses the purpose of LEMOA, misrepresenting its focus on logistical cooperation.  The agreement is about streamlining logistical support, not technology transfer.

Statement 3 is correct. CAATSA presents a potential challenge to India-US relations, particularly regarding sanctions related to India's engagement with certain countries. The statement accurately highlights a potential area of friction between the two nations.

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an air operation conducted by the Indian Air Force, not the navy. The Indian Navy's role was primarily in Operation Talwar, a naval blockade in the Arabian Sea.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Kargil Review Committee was established in July 1999, not 1998, following the conclusion of the war.  Statement 3 is correct; Tololing and Tiger Hill were indeed crucial high-altitude positions fiercely contested during the Kargil conflict. These locations held strategic importance due to their overlooking positions on key supply routes and communication lines.  The correct answer is (c) because only statement 3 accurately reflects an aspect of the Kargil War.  The other statements contain factual errors related to the roles of the different branches of the Indian armed forces and the timeline of the KRC’s establishment.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect as the GCI 2024 evaluates a broader range of factors beyond just technological aspects; it also includes legal frameworks, organizational capacity, and public awareness.  Statement 2 is false; "role-modelling" status signifies a strong commitment, but not necessarily a perfect score.  A strong commitment involves multiple factors, not a flawless achievement on all parameters.  Statement 3 is an oversimplification; the GCI 2024 shows a spectrum of commitment levels, with some countries making progress while others lag, not a uniform weakness across the board.  The index provides a nuanced assessment of cybersecurity preparedness.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because the CWC entered into force in 1997, not 1992, and it has not been ratified by all UN member states; a few countries remain non-signatories. Statement 2 is inaccurate as the CWC's verification process includes robust independent on-site inspections of declared and undeclared chemical weapons facilities, not solely relying on self-reporting.  Statement 3 is too broad; the CWC prohibits the diversion of chemicals specifically for weaponization or military applications but allows for legitimate industrial or scientific uses of certain chemicals under strict controls and reporting requirements.  The convention's effectiveness depends on rigorous verification and a clear distinction between legitimate and illicit chemical activities.


**4. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's MERs assess a country's efforts to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but not cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2002, reflecting its early commitment to combating financial crimes.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, plays a crucial role in gathering and disseminating financial intelligence for investigations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while the MERs primarily focus on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation, they increasingly incorporate considerations of cybercrime and its links to other financial crimes. Statement 2 is false; India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2002. Statement 3 is correct; the FIU-IND is indeed vital for collecting and analyzing financial data to support investigations into financial crimes. The accuracy of Statement 3 is based on the factual establishment date of the FIU-IND.  The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding the scope of MERs and the timing of India's first evaluation.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Lake Turkana is indeed Africa's largest permanent desert lake and the world's largest permanent alkaline lake, but it's not the second-largest alkaline lake globally; that ranking varies depending on the definition and measurement used.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana. Statement 3 is also incorrect; a recent survey conducted jointly by UNESCO and the World Food Programme (WFP) actually revealed high, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana – a significant finding after a 50-year gap in comprehensive surveys.  Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate.  The question tests knowledge of geographical facts and recent developments concerning Lake Turkana, requiring precise recall of details that are not commonly known.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1, 2, and 3
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that the MER assesses measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation of WMDs.

Statement 2 is also likely correct. While the text only mentions the initial adoption in 2010, it's reasonable to assume that such important evaluations are updated periodically to reflect changes in criminal activities.  The absence of explicit mention of updates doesn't make the statement incorrect.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the peer-review process aims for objectivity, it's unrealistic to assume complete immunity from political influences or national interests in international relations. The statement presents an overly idealistic view of the process.

While cybercrime is a significant concern, it's not explicitly within the core mandate of the initial MER assessments.  The FATF's focus is on traditional financial crimes linked to terrorism and weapons proliferation.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's initial MER was indeed adopted in 2010.  However, the FATF's evaluations are not static; they are updated periodically to reflect changes in global threats, technological advancements, and best practices in combating financial crimes.  This ongoing evaluation process is crucial for adaptation and effectiveness.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FATF does not itself have the power to impose direct sanctions. Its role is primarily to set standards, conduct evaluations, and identify countries with strategic deficiencies.  However, its findings and recommendations can trigger actions by other international organizations or individual countries, leading to indirect consequences such as financial restrictions or diplomatic pressure.  The FATF's influence is significant, but it operates through a system of peer review and international cooperation rather than direct punitive measures.

3. AFSPA provides certain immunities to armed forces personnel against legal proceedings, except under specific circumstances.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AFSPA grants special powers to all three wings of the armed forces – the Army, Navy, and Air Force – when deployed in areas declared as "disturbed" under the Act.  The act's provisions apply to all personnel involved in operations under its purview.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the declaration of a region as a "disturbed area" is a prerequisite for AFSPA's application, this declaration can be made by the Governor of a state, the administrator of a Union Territory, or the central government, not solely by the Union Home Minister.  The process involves multiple levels of authority.

Statement 3 is correct. AFSPA does provide certain immunities to armed forces personnel against prosecution for actions taken in the course of their duties in "disturbed areas."  However, this immunity is not absolute; legal proceedings can be initiated under specific conditions, typically requiring prior sanction from the central government.  The balance between providing necessary protection to personnel and ensuring accountability is a complex issue.





**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction but excludes cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and its measures to combat money laundering include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) in 2004.
3.  The FATF's recommendations are legally binding on all member countries, and non-compliance can result in sanctions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The FATF's MER does assess measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  However, while cybercrime is a growing concern and related to financial crimes, it's not explicitly a primary focus of the standard MER process.  The core focus remains on the three areas mentioned.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was adopted in 2010, and the PMLA, 2002, and the FIU-IND (established in 2004) are key components of its anti-money laundering framework.  The statement accurately reflects these facts.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FATF's recommendations are not legally binding.  While non-compliance can lead to reputational damage and potential difficulties in international financial transactions, there's no formal legal mechanism for direct sanctions from the FATF itself.  Individual countries may have their own legal frameworks to address non-compliance with FATF standards.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 indicates that opioids are the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The report identifies the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Golden Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, now called the Death Triangle) as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking.
3. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses solely on the illegal wildlife trade related to endangered species and does not address the intersection of wildlife crime and drug trafficking.

2. AFSPA is currently in effect across all states and union territories of India.
3. The declaration of a "disturbed area" under AFSPA requires the approval of both the state government and the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in "disturbed areas," including the authority to arrest without warrants, conduct searches, and open fire in certain circumstances.  The statement accurately reflects these powers.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  AFSPA is not in effect across all states and union territories.  Its application is geographically limited to specific areas deemed "disturbed" within certain states and union territories.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The declaration of a "disturbed area" can be made by the Governor of a state, the administrator of a union territory, or by the central government.  It doesn't necessarily require the joint approval of both the state and central governments.


**7. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. India is a signatory to the CWC and has enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to implement its provisions domestically.
2. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, but allows for the production of these weapons for peaceful purposes under strict regulations.
3. The CWC established an international organization to monitor compliance with its provisions, and India is a member of this organization's executive council.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that India is a signatory to the CWC and has the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to enforce the convention.

Statement 2 is partially correct, but the wording is misleading. The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons. While there are exceptions for permitted purposes such as for research and development under strict control, the overall aim is complete elimination.  The statement's phrasing implies a more permissive stance than is actually the case.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text doesn't specify whether India is a member of the executive council.  While the CWC likely has an organization for monitoring compliance, the text doesn't confirm India's specific role within this structure.


**8. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

2. The PGII prioritizes funding for infrastructure projects that are environmentally sustainable and promote inclusive economic growth.
3. The PGII is a solely grant-based initiative; it does not involve any form of loan financing for infrastructure projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text states the PGII was launched in 2022 with the goal of mobilizing up to $600 billion by 2027 for infrastructure projects in developing nations.  While the text doesn't explicitly state it's a G7 initiative, the context suggests a strong G7 involvement.

Statement 2 is correct. The PGII aims to fund sustainable and inclusive infrastructure projects, aligning with the broader goals of sustainable development and economic growth.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text doesn't specify the exact funding mechanisms of the PGII.  It's highly unlikely that it would be solely grant-based;  a combination of grants, loans, and other forms of financing is more plausible for such a large-scale initiative.


**9. With reference to the Rome Statute for the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The Rome Statute established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide but excludes crimes committed by state officials during peacetime.

3. India is a signatory to the Rome Statute and has fully incorporated all of its provisions into its domestic legal framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishes the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, and it does *not* exclude crimes committed by state officials during peacetime.  The ICC's jurisdiction applies to individuals regardless of their official capacity if the crimes fall under its mandate.

Statement 2 is correct. The Rome Statute is a treaty, and ratification implies a legal obligation for cooperating with the ICC's processes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not state whether India is a signatory to the Rome Statute, let alone whether it has fully incorporated its provisions into its domestic legal framework.  Many countries have signed the Rome Statute but have not ratified it, or have ratified it with reservations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the UPU is a UN specialized agency, the text doesn't state that India is a founding member.  The text mentions a commemorative stamp marking the 150th anniversary, implying India's involvement but not necessarily as a founder.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly mentions India Post observing its 170th anniversary.

Statement 3 is correct. The UPU's primary function is to facilitate international postal services, ensuring efficiency and security in the exchange of postal items.  This accurately reflects the UPU's main role.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding Lake Turkana:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. While it's not technically the world's *largest* desert lake (that title is debated), it is the largest *permanent* desert lake and the largest alkaline lake in the world. This makes option (a) the most appropriate answer despite the slight inaccuracy regarding the "largest desert lake" claim.


Statement 2 is incorrect. The Omo River, which is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana, originates in Ethiopia, not Kenya. This is a significant geographical detail that makes the statement factually inaccurate.


Statement 3 is incorrect.  The UNESCO and WFP survey actually revealed *high*, not low, fish potential in Lake Turkana, contrary to the statement's claim. This directly contradicts the information provided in the source material.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts. Firstly, Mount Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya. Secondly, while it is the highest peak in Africa,  it's not solely composed of basalt; it's a stratovolcano made up of ash, lava, and rock.


Statement 2 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the largest free-standing mountain in the world, meaning it's not part of a larger mountain range.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Indian flag was planted on the Uhuru Peak, the highest summit of Kilimanjaro, not Mawenzi Peak.  This represents a key detail that negates the statement's accuracy.



**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is situated at the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, and is located in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand.

3.  The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces the travel time for the Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Lipulekh Pass is at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  This is a crucial geographical error that renders the statement false.


Statement 2 is largely correct. The Lipulekh Pass is indeed a significant pass in the Kumaun region, located in the Kali Valley. Its closure during the COVID-19 pandemic did impact trade, primarily between India and Nepal. The statement is accurate despite the implication that it solely impacted Nepal.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra, not the Amarnath Yatra. This substitution of pilgrimage routes makes the statement factually inaccurate.



**4. Consider the following statements concerning the Suez Canal Route:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Arabian Sea, providing the shortest maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2.  India recently shifted some of its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route due to rising canal tolls and geopolitical instability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Suez Canal correctly connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Arabian Sea.  The statement's claim about it being the shortest route between Asia and Europe is accurate. The inaccuracy regarding the Arabian Sea makes it incorrect.


Statement 2 is correct.  India did shift some fuel exports to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope route due to factors including rising Suez Canal tolls and geopolitical concerns.


Statement 3 is incorrect. The Suez Canal is located in Egypt, not Jordan. This is a major geographical inaccuracy that makes the statement false.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 1 correctly identifies key components of the India-Maldives Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership, showcasing India's economic and financial diplomacy.  The Currency Swap Agreement is a crucial tool for stabilizing exchange rates and providing liquidity support, particularly important for smaller economies like the Maldives.  The introduction of RuPay cards expands financial inclusion and reduces reliance on other payment systems.

Statement 2 highlights India's humanitarian assistance and development cooperation with the Maldives, exemplified by Operation Neer and Vaccine Maitri. These initiatives demonstrate India's commitment to regional stability and its role as a responsible global power providing aid during crises. The Greater Male Connectivity Project underscores India's infrastructure development initiatives in the region, fostering connectivity and economic growth.

Statement 3 accurately describes the multifaceted India-Australia Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP).  The CSP's breadth encompasses defence cooperation through joint military exercises (AUSINDEX, PITCH BLACK, etc.),  economic ties via a trade agreement, and collaborations in emerging sectors like clean energy and critical minerals.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict different facets of cross-border energy cooperation in South Asia. Statement 1 correctly identifies the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline's role in natural gas transportation and the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline's function in supplying petroleum products to Nepal.  These pipelines are crucial for enhancing energy security and reducing reliance on other sources.

Statement 2 accurately highlights the initiatives for cross-border electricity trade, mentioning specific projects in India-Nepal and India-Bangladesh collaborations. The Arun III and Upper Karnali projects represent significant hydropower developments, while the Katihar-Bornagar corridor underscores efforts to integrate electricity grids.  These projects aim to increase energy access, improve regional grid stability, and promote sustainable energy development.

Statement 3 correctly mentions the significant hydropower projects in Bhutan—Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu—that are part of India-Bhutan energy cooperation. These projects contribute substantially to Bhutan's energy needs and its economic development, demonstrating the beneficial aspects of transboundary resource management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are accurate representations of India's relationship with Bhutan and Bangladesh respectively.  Statement 2 correctly identifies the 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation (renewed in 2007) as the cornerstone of India-Bhutan relations and accurately states that the Indian Prime Minister received Bhutan's highest civilian honor.

Statement 3 correctly describes the significant trade relationship between India and Bangladesh, highlighting their positions as major trading partners in the region and mentioning the joint military exercises SAMPRITI and MILAN, symbolizing defense cooperation.

However, Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship is indeed foundational to India-Nepal relations,  India is Nepal's largest trading partner, but the statement incorrectly implies that India's trade volume with Nepal exceeds that of China.  While India is a significant trading partner for Nepal, China's trade volume with Nepal is substantial and not necessarily consistently lower than India's.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely correct.

**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes assessment of  cybercrime.

3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence for law enforcement agencies, but lacks direct enforcement powers.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The FATF's MER does indeed assess measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing. However, while cybercrime is increasingly relevant to these areas, it's not explicitly a core element of the standard MER assessment. Therefore, it's not entirely false to say it is excluded, although it might be indirectly addressed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India's MER was first adopted in 2010, the provided text only mentions the adoption of the report in 2010 and doesn't state that a subsequent update occurred in 2024.  The question plays on the familiarity of the reader with updates on such reports.

Statement 3 is correct. The FIU-IND's primary function is intelligence gathering and analysis; it doesn't have the authority to directly enforce laws.  This contrasts with agencies like the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), which has enforcement powers.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The provided text identifies cannabis as the most abused drug, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy. The statement simplifies the findings, but the core information is accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent, but it doesn't imply these are the *only* regions covered in the World Wildlife Crime Report.  The report's scope likely encompasses a broader geographical area. The question uses a misleading absolute statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The passage highlights the Triple Frontier Area as a significant drug trafficking region and mentions the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent.  The statement incorrectly suggests that the latter two are of "lesser concern." The question uses a misleading comparative statement.


**3. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC initiative is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe through land-based infrastructure projects, ignoring maritime routes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the provided text doesn't explicitly detail the routes, it's unlikely that an initiative aiming to connect India, the Middle East, and Europe would *exclusively* rely on land-based infrastructure. Maritime routes are crucial for such a vast geographic area. The question uses a misleading exclusionary statement.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The IMEC is intended to enhance connectivity, thereby impacting trade and investment flows between India and both Europe and the Middle East.  The statement falsely suggests minimal impact on India's Middle Eastern trade relations. The question uses a misleading minimization statement.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage explicitly states that the IMEC's significance was highlighted during the CII India Mediterranean Business Conclave.  This underscores the importance of the corridor for trade with Mediterranean countries.



**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text clearly states that Belarus joined the SCO at the Astana summit.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage mentions the adoption of a "Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism," directly contradicting the statement's claim that security and counter-terrorism are neglected. The question uses a misleading omission statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the SCO Development Strategy likely addresses infrastructure, the text also mentions the adoption of an anti-drug strategy, showing that counter-terrorism and anti-drug efforts are not downplayed. The question uses a misleading emphasis statement.


**5. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council, with India as Vice-Chair, focuses solely on strengthening supply chains related to critical minerals, neglecting other aspects of supply chain resilience.
2. The IPEF's Clean Economy Agreement promotes clean energy technology development and deployment, but excludes support for MSMEs in developing nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions the Supply Chain Council's focus on strengthening critical supply chains, but this doesn't imply an *exclusive* focus on critical minerals.  The statement uses a misleading restriction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage explicitly states that the Clean Economy Agreement includes investments and capacity building for MSMEs. The statement uses a misleading omission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly mentions that the Fair Economy Agreement includes both anti-corruption measures and improved cross-border investigations.  The statement uses a misleading omission.  All three statements contain incorrect information through omission or restriction, making (a) the only correct answer.


**6. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents of nuclear material theft, excluding other forms of nuclear security breaches such as loss or unauthorized access.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB primarily focuses on theft, it's unlikely to exclude other serious security breaches. The statement uses an overly restrictive description.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The program's aim is to improve food security, which likely includes considerations for sustainable practices. The statement uses a misleading omission.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The initiative's focus on net-zero emissions doesn't preclude acknowledging other low-carbon energy sources. The statement uses a misleading restriction.  All three statements contain incorrect information, making (d) the only correct answer.

2. The GCI 2024 categorizes countries into tiers based on their cybersecurity capabilities, indicating that most countries are either "establishing" or "evolving" their cybersecurity infrastructure.
3.  The ITU's Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024  focuses exclusively on governmental cybersecurity strategies, neglecting the role of private sector organizations in national cybersecurity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The passage states that India is among the "role-modeling" countries in the GCI 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage mentions that most countries are in the "establishing" or "evolving" tiers, indicating varying levels of cybersecurity infrastructure development.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the GCI likely focuses on national-level strategies, it's improbable that it completely ignores the critical role of the private sector in overall national cybersecurity. The statement uses a misleading exclusion.


**8. With reference to the India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Singapore elevated their strategic partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024, focusing primarily on defence cooperation and neglecting economic ties.
2. Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its 6th largest globally (2023-24), with India maintaining a significant trade surplus with Singapore.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text highlights the elevation of the partnership, but it doesn't suggest a neglect of economic ties; in fact, economic cooperation is explicitly mentioned. The statement uses a misleading emphasis.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The passage states Singapore is India's largest ASEAN trading partner and 6th largest globally, but it also says India is a *net importer* from Singapore, indicating a trade *deficit*, not a surplus. The statement uses an incorrect factual claim.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text mentions those four countries, it doesn't state that *no other* countries are included in Project Nexus.  The statement uses a misleading exclusion.  All three statements contain inaccuracies, making (d) the only correct option.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Bangladesh is India’s biggest trade partner in South Asia and India is the second biggest for Bangladesh.  It does *not* state a balanced trade relationship. The statement uses an inaccurate factual claim.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text mentions defence cooperation (SAMPRITI and MILAN), but it also mentions infrastructure projects like the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline, contradicting the statement's claim of minimal cooperation in other areas. The statement uses a misleading minimization.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Improved port access is likely to positively impact trade volumes between the two countries. The statement uses a misleading denial.  All three statements are incorrect, making (a) the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the framework facilitates cross-border payments, it's unlikely to exclusively use the Indian Rupee.  The statement uses a misleading restriction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text refers to a SAARC framework, implying a multilateral agreement, not a series of bilateral agreements. The statement uses an inaccurate structural description.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the text mentions other CSAs, it doesn't state that the SAARC CSA is unique in its scope and objectives. The statement uses an unsupported claim.  All three statements are incorrect, making (d) the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is for his *third* term, spanning 2025-2030. The question deliberately misrepresents this crucial detail to act as a distractor.  Statement 2 is correct. While the INCB addresses multiple illicit drugs, opioids are a significant focus due to their widespread abuse and devastating consequences.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The INCB is an independent body established under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.  It is not a subsidiary of the UNODC, although both organizations work towards similar goals in drug control.  The close relationship between the INCB and UNODC might mislead candidates unfamiliar with the precise structure of these organizations.  This question tests factual recall and the ability to differentiate between closely related international bodies.


**2. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused primarily on combating cybercrime and data breaches.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to involve youth in promoting restorative justice practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 33rd session of the CCPCJ focused on combating transnational organized crime (TOC), not specifically cybercrime. This is a deliberate attempt to create confusion by using a related but distinct area of crime. Statement 2 is partially correct, but the question subtly alters the initiative's focus. GenJust aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice, which encompasses a broader scope than merely restorative justice.  Statement 3 is correct. The CCPCJ is indeed a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly, responsible for advising on crime prevention and criminal justice matters.  The question tests factual knowledge and the ability to critically evaluate nuanced information about UN bodies, requiring accurate recall of the CCPCJ's mandate.


**3. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) network, consider the following statements:**

1. GlobE's membership is limited to countries within the G20.
2. India's election to the GlobE steering committee signifies its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. GlobE's membership is not restricted to G20 nations; it encompasses a wider range of countries committed to combating corruption. This distractor plays on the common association of India with the G20. Statement 2 is correct.  India's participation in GlobE's steering committee demonstrates its dedication to international anti-corruption initiatives and cooperation.  Statement 3 is partially true but overstates GlobE's role. While GlobE facilitates international cooperation in anti-corruption efforts, its primary function is not solely focused on coordinating investigations into financial crimes; it addresses a broader spectrum of corruption issues. The question assesses knowledge of international anti-corruption mechanisms and the ability to distinguish between the primary function and associated activities of such networks.


**4. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat human trafficking and smuggling.

3. The FATF is an intergovernmental organization headquartered in Paris.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER focuses on combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, not human trafficking and smuggling.  This distractor introduces a related but distinct area of concern, testing the examinee's precise understanding of the FATF's mandate. Statement 2 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2005.  This minor chronological error acts as a subtle distractor. Statement 3 is correct.  The FATF is indeed an intergovernmental organization with its headquarters in Paris. The question assesses recall of factual information about the FATF and its assessment process, emphasizing the need for precise knowledge of dates and the scope of its evaluations.


**5. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most widely abused drug globally.

3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally, not cocaine. This distractor uses a common illicit drug to create confusion. Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, not limiting its focus to Africa. This is a geographical distractor.  Statement 3 is correct. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for UNTOC, providing support and coordination for its implementation.  The question requires precise knowledge of the UNODC's reports and its role in international conventions, testing factual recall and understanding of the organization's functions.


**6. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is fully demarcated and mutually agreed upon.
2.  The Galwan incident of 2020 was the deadliest border clash between India and China since 1962.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2005. The objective of reducing trade barriers and deepening economic ties between ASEAN and India remains accurate. Statement 2 is incorrect. India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus. This is a persistent challenge in the bilateral trade relationship.  Statement 3 is correct. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting did indeed take place in Jakarta to review the AITIGA's performance and effectiveness.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPOI is a non-treaty based, voluntary arrangement, not a legally binding treaty.  The nature of the agreement is a crucial distinction.

Statement 2 is incorrect. IPOI was launched in 2019 at the EAS in Bangkok, Thailand, not in 2018 in Singapore.  The year and location of the launch are important facts.

Statement 3 is correct.  IPOI's underlying principles are directly linked to and expand upon the SAGAR initiative. This connection is a key aspect of IPOI's conceptual framework.


**1. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks nuclear material theft incidents reported by member states.
2.  The Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to enhance agricultural productivity and food security globally, while Atoms4NetZero focuses solely on promoting nuclear energy for climate change mitigation.
3. The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles aims to improve the safety and efficiency of existing nuclear reactor technologies, without exploring new reactor designs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while the ITDB does focus on nuclear material theft, it doesn't exclusively track incidents reported only by member states.  The IAEA also monitors and reports on illicit trafficking from various sources, including non-member states or even non-state actors.  The database is designed to be as comprehensive as possible in its coverage.

Statement 2 is incorrect because Atoms4Food's scope is broader than merely enhancing agricultural productivity. It addresses various aspects of global food security, including improving crop yields, livestock management, and tackling food-related diseases. Similarly, Atoms4NetZero's ambition is not limited to just climate change mitigation; it aims to promote nuclear energy's role in a wider sustainable energy mix.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles is explicitly focused on innovation and exploring *new* reactor technologies and fuel cycles, not just improving existing ones.  This is crucial for ensuring the long-term sustainability and safety of nuclear energy.  The project's core mission is to develop advanced reactor designs that are safer, more efficient, and less prone to proliferation risks.


**2. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1992 and enforced in 1997, mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles within a decade of its ratification by each member state.
2.  Verification under the CWC relies solely on self-reporting by member states, without any on-site inspections or independent verification mechanisms.
3.  The CWC prohibits the diversion of chemical materials to weapon use or military applications, but allows their use for peaceful purposes without any restrictions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the CWC does mandate the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, the timeframe for destruction isn't a fixed decade. It's a process with deadlines and extensions dependent on the specific circumstances of each state's stockpile and capabilities. The destruction process is complex and requires significant resources and technical expertise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC features a robust verification regime, which includes extensive on-site inspections of chemical weapons stockpiles, production facilities, and research programs by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).  This independent verification is a cornerstone of the treaty's effectiveness.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the CWC does allow the use of chemical materials for peaceful purposes, it's not without restrictions.  The Convention establishes strict controls and reporting mechanisms to prevent the diversion of chemicals to weapons development or military applications. There are specific guidelines and regulations governing the production and use of chemicals for civilian purposes to ensure they are not misused.


**3. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 consist of five treaties, each addressing a specific aspect of international humanitarian law during armed conflict.
2.  Geneva Convention IV exclusively protects civilian populations in occupied territories during wartime, without addressing the treatment of prisoners of war or wounded soldiers.
3. Protocol III, added in 2005, introduced a new emblem alongside the Red Cross and Red Crescent, expanding the visual identifiers for humanitarian organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions of 1949 comprise four, not five, treaties. Each addresses a distinct category of protected persons or situations during armed conflict: wounded and sick soldiers on land (I), wounded, sick, and shipwrecked military personnel at sea (II), prisoners of war (III), and civilians (IV).

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Geneva Convention IV primarily focuses on the protection of civilians in occupied territories, it's not exclusive to that. The Conventions are interconnected, and other conventions address aspects related to the treatment of prisoners of war and wounded soldiers.

Statement 3 is correct. Protocol III to the Geneva Conventions, adopted in 2005, added the red crystal as an additional protective emblem alongside the existing Red Cross and Red Crescent symbols. This was done to provide additional protection for humanitarian workers and personnel in areas where the traditional symbols might not be recognized or respected.


**4. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assess a country's effectiveness in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but not other forms of financial crime.
2.  India's MER is a one-time assessment conducted only upon the country's initial request for membership in the FATF.  Once adopted, there are no further reviews.
3. The FATF's peer review process involves only FATF member states; non-member states are excluded from the evaluation process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF's MERs primarily focus on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,  they also consider other related financial crimes that can be used to support these activities. The scope of the assessment is broad and covers various aspects of a country's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The FATF's MERs are not a one-time assessment.  They are periodic reviews conducted to assess a country's ongoing compliance with international standards and the effectiveness of its AML/CFT measures.  The process involves regular updates and follow-up reviews to ensure continuous improvement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the peer review process is primarily conducted by FATF member states, the FATF also engages with and seeks input from non-member states, particularly when their actions have a significant impact on the global financial system.  The FATF's goal is to promote global cooperation and adherence to AML/CFT standards, regardless of membership status.


**5. With reference to the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNODC's World Drug Report focuses solely on the global production and trafficking of illicit drugs, excluding aspects of drug use patterns and trends.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report solely focuses on illegal wildlife trade in Africa and does not cover other regions of the world.
3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), but does not actively participate in implementing its provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Report provides a comprehensive overview of the global drug problem, including production, trafficking, and consumption patterns.  It analyzes drug markets, trends in drug use, and the impact of drug abuse on public health and security.  It's a multifaceted assessment of the global drug situation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report covers illegal wildlife trade globally, not just in Africa.  It examines various aspects of wildlife trafficking, including the species involved, trafficking routes, and the criminal networks involved across different regions of the world.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNODC serves as the secretariat for the UNTOC, playing a vital role in its implementation.  It provides technical assistance to member states, facilitates international cooperation, and actively promotes the treaty's objectives.  The UNODC is deeply involved in all aspects of UNTOC implementation.


**6. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. The CMF is a solely Western-led coalition and does not include any non-Western countries as member states.
2.  India's participation in the CMF is limited to joint naval exercises and does not involve participation in counter-terrorism operations.
3. Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CMF is a multinational coalition, not solely Western-led. It includes a diverse range of countries from different regions, reflecting a commitment to global maritime security.  The coalition's membership reflects a broad international partnership.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's involvement in the CMF is not limited to joint naval exercises.  India actively participates in the CMF's counter-terrorism operations, contributing to maritime security efforts in the region.  This involvement goes beyond mere exercises and demonstrates India's commitment to global security cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While Operation Crimson Barracuda was a significant operation, it was not the *first* counter-terrorism operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF. India's participation involves numerous collaborative efforts and operations to combat maritime threats.  Operation Crimson Barracuda was one notable instance among many.



Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions focus more on international organizations and treaties rather than strictly economic topics.  However, the questions are designed to be challenging and require in-depth knowledge of the subjects.


**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC was adopted in 1993 and entered into force in 1998, aiming to eliminate chemical weapons globally.
2.  Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan are among the 193 member states that have ratified the CWC.
3.  The Convention includes provisions for the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles and verification mechanisms to ensure compliance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The CWC does indeed include provisions for the destruction of chemical weapons and verification mechanisms to ensure compliance.  This is a core element of the treaty.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997, not 1993 and 1998.  These dates are crucial for understanding the treaty's timeline.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The four countries listed (Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan) are *not* parties to the CWC. The text explicitly states that these nations are non-signatories.  This highlights the limitations of the treaty's universal reach.  The question uses a distractor by presenting these nations as signatories.


**2. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to nuclear material theft within the member states of the IAEA.
2.  Atoms4Food is an IAEA program focused on using nuclear technologies to enhance global food production and security.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly mentions Atoms4Food as an IAEA program utilizing nuclear techniques to improve global food security.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB does track incidents of nuclear material theft, it's not limited to only IAEA member states; the information provided states that 31 states were involved in the reported incidents.  This is a key difference.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The program's focus is on innovation in *nuclear reactor* technologies, not exclusively nuclear *fusion* reactor technologies.  The question subtly changes the focus from fission to fusion, creating a deceptive element.  Fusion technology is a distinct and separate area of nuclear research.


**3. With reference to the Geneva Conventions of 1949, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Geneva Conventions consist of five key treaties focusing on the protection of victims of armed conflicts, both international and non-international.
2.  Geneva Convention IV primarily protects wounded and sick soldiers on land during armed conflict.
3.  India has ratified all four Geneva Conventions of 1949 and the Additional Protocols.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. India's ratification of the Geneva Conventions and Additional Protocols is explicitly stated in the text.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Geneva Conventions consist of four, not five, key treaties. The question adds an extra treaty to confuse the candidate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Geneva Convention IV protects civilians, particularly in occupied territories, during conflict, not wounded and sick soldiers on land (that's Convention I). The question incorrectly assigns the function of one convention to another, creating a subtle but significant error.  The candidate must know the specific responsibilities of each convention.



**4. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes evaluation of domestic financial regulations.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2015, providing a comprehensive assessment of the country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) plays a crucial role in India's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The FIU-IND's role in combating money laundering and terrorist financing is explicitly mentioned in the text.

Statement 1 is incorrect because the MER does indeed assess measures related to the proliferation of WMDs, and it implicitly evaluates domestic financial regulations by assessing the efficacy of a country's overall framework to combat these financial crimes.

Statement 2 is incorrect because the provided text states that India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2015.  This is a crucial detail that differentiates a correct answer from an incorrect one.  The question subtly alters the date, making it a significant distractor.


**5.  With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1.  The NSCS was established in 2001 based on recommendations from the K.C. Pant-led task force.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the NSA, primarily focuses on short-term national security policy analysis.
3. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), headed by the NSA, ensures inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly outlines the SPG's role in inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The NSC was constituted in 1999, not 2001.  The question plays on the dates and the functions of the bodies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB provides *long-term* analysis and policy recommendations, not short-term analysis. The question inverts the timeframe for analysis, a key detail that changes the meaning.


These questions demonstrate the required difficulty level, incorporate plausible distractors, and assess various cognitive skills, including factual recall and analysis.  They avoid being overly obvious and require a deep understanding of the topics.


**1. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) primarily focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking incidents globally, excluding data on nuclear material theft.
2.  Atoms4NetZero, an IAEA program, solely concentrates on promoting renewable energy sources to achieve net-zero emissions, excluding nuclear energy.
3. The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program utilizes nuclear science and technology exclusively for the prevention and control of zoonotic diseases, not for management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the ITDB explicitly includes reports on nuclear material theft.  The provided text clearly states that the ITDB reported 168 incidents of *nuclear material theft*.  Focusing solely on illicit trafficking excludes a significant aspect of the database's function.

Statement 2 is incorrect because Atoms4NetZero explicitly promotes *nuclear energy* as a means to achieve net-zero emissions.  The text clearly mentions the program's aim to promote nuclear energy.  This is a key component of the IAEA's strategy for reducing carbon emissions.

Statement 3 is incorrect as the program description does not limit its use to *prevention and control exclusively*.  While disease prevention and control are certainly elements, the term "management" is broader and encompasses various aspects, including monitoring, response, and mitigation efforts.  The use of "exclusively" is a significant oversimplification and makes the statement false.


**2. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments based on a single cybersecurity pillar, focusing solely on legislative frameworks.
2.  India's classification as a "role-modelling" country in Tier 1 of the GCI 2024 signifies a weak commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars.
3. The GCI 2024 indicates that most countries are either "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4) in their cybersecurity capabilities, showcasing a global lack of significant progress.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments across *five* pillars, not just legislative frameworks. The text doesn't specify the exact weighting of each pillar, but it's clear that a multi-faceted approach is used.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's placement in Tier 1 ("role-modelling") signifies a *strong* commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars, not a weak one.  The text explicitly mentions India's inclusion in this tier as demonstrating a strong commitment.

Statement 3 is a distortion of the facts. While the text indicates that most countries are in Tiers 3 or 4, it doesn't imply a lack of significant progress.  "Establishing" and "evolving" are stages of development; they don't inherently mean a lack of progress.  Many countries are actively working to improve their cybersecurity, even if they are not yet at the "role-modelling" stage.


**3. With reference to India's foreign relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Enhanced Strategic Partnership between India and Malaysia, established in 2015, was downgraded to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2024 due to disagreements on trade policies.
2.  Following the ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina,  Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus assumed the role of interim Prime Minister of Bangladesh, significantly impacting India-Bangladesh relations.
3.  The Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership between India and the Maldives focuses exclusively on economic cooperation, neglecting maritime security aspects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Enhanced Strategic Partnership between India and Malaysia was *upgraded* to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, not downgraded.  The provided text explicitly states this elevation.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the text mentions the ouster of Sheikh Hasina and Yunus's role in an interim government, it doesn't state that he became the interim *Prime Minister*. The text is ambiguous on the exact nature of Yunus's role, making this statement unreliable.  Furthermore, the text does not discuss any significant impact on India-Bangladesh relations resulting from this event.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The partnership between India and the Maldives explicitly encompasses both *economic* and *maritime security* aspects. The text clearly uses the phrase "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership," indicating a focus on both areas.


**4. With reference to international organizations and agreements, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) permits the development of chemical weapons for defensive purposes under strict international oversight.
2. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) process solely assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, excluding terrorist financing and weapons proliferation.
3. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is a specialized agency of the World Bank, not the United Nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CWC *bans* the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, with no exceptions for defensive purposes.  The text mentions the CWC's purpose as banning these activities.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FATF MER process explicitly assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, *and* the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  The text clearly lists all three areas as being within the scope of the MER.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UPU is a specialized agency of the *United Nations*, not the World Bank.  The text explicitly states that the UPU is a UN specialized agency.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is situated in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, and is the world's largest permanent desert lake.
2.  The Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, is the primary water source for Lake Turkana.
3. A recent UNESCO and WFP survey revealed that Lake Turkana has a low fish potential, requiring significant investment for sustainable fishing practices.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.  It is also the largest *permanent* desert lake in the world,  but  not necessarily the largest desert lake overall (depending on the definition of "desert lake" and the inclusion of temporary lakes). The qualification of "permanent" is crucial here as many desert lakes are ephemeral.

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River is the primary source of water for Lake Turkana.  Its flow significantly influences the lake's water level and ecosystem.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The recent survey actually revealed *high* fish potential in Lake Turkana, a significant finding given its location and environmental conditions. This contradicts the statement, making it false.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano located in Tanzania, Africa, and is the highest mountain in Africa, but not the highest free-standing mountain in the world.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro's Uhuru Peak is the highest point on the mountain and is significantly lower than Mount Everest.
3.  Mount Kilimanjaro is composed primarily of basalt and volcanic ash, making it a geologically young formation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a stratovolcano located in Tanzania and is the highest mountain in Africa. While it is a very large free-standing mountain, the claim of being the *highest* free-standing mountain globally is debatable and requires a precise definition of "free-standing" which is not uniformly applied. There are other contenders for this title.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While Uhuru Peak is the highest point on Kilimanjaro,  the statement misleads by comparing its height to Mount Everest which is in a completely different mountain range. The focus should be on its height relative to other African mountains, not a global comparison.

Statement 3 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is a stratovolcano formed from layers of ash, lava, and rock, consistent with its volcanic origin. This makes it a comparatively geologically young formation compared to many other mountains.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, and is situated in the Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand, facilitating trade between India and Tibet.
2. The Lipulekh Pass is a crucial route for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, significantly reducing travel time.
3.  The Lipulekh Pass was temporarily closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but its reopening has been hindered by ongoing border disputes between India and China.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct in that Lipulekh Pass is near the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal and located in Uttarakhand.  However,  the statement implying continuous and unhindered trade between India and Tibet through the pass is inaccurate, given the geopolitical complexities and border disputes in the region.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass is a historically important and significantly shorter route for pilgrims undertaking the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra.

Statement 3 is correct. The pass was closed temporarily due to the pandemic, and its reopening is indeed subject to the resolution of ongoing border tensions and disputes between India and China, which affects the overall accessibility of the pass.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, forming a crucial maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2.  India recently shifted a significant portion of its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route due to rising geopolitical tensions.
3. The Suez Canal is entirely located within the borders of Egypt and is under the sole control of the Egyptian government,  with no international oversight.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Suez Canal's geographical location and function as a shortcut between Asia and Europe are well-established facts.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's shift of fuel exports to the longer Cape of Good Hope route reflects strategic considerations, including concerns about potential disruptions or increased costs related to using the Suez Canal, possibly due to geopolitical instability.

Statement 3 is partially correct in that the Suez Canal is primarily within Egypt. However,  the statement that it is under *sole* control of Egypt without any international oversight is inaccurate. The canal's operation and management involve international agreements, treaties, and regulations, even though Egypt retains primary control.  The nuances of international maritime law and agreements make the statement an oversimplification.


**5. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India launched the RuPay card in the Maldives to enhance financial connectivity and reduce reliance on other international payment systems.
2.  A Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) was recently signed between India and the Maldives to assist the Maldives in managing its foreign exchange reserves and improve financial stability.
3. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives significantly weakened bilateral relations, leading to a complete cessation of Indian aid and developmental projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The introduction of the RuPay card in the Maldives is a significant step in strengthening financial ties and providing an alternative payment option.

Outreach countries are invited to participate in specific discussions and events but are not full members with voting rights.


**1. With reference to India's engagement with international organizations combating financial crimes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with India's MER first adopted in 2000.
2.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is a key institution in India's anti-money laundering efforts, collaborating closely with the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956.
3. India's legislative framework for combating money laundering primarily relies on the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), enacted in 1992, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), enacted in 1967.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While the FATF MER does assess the mentioned areas, India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2000.  The  year 2000 is significant for India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, a separate piece of legislation.  The timeline is crucial for accurate understanding of India's participation in international efforts against financial crimes.

Statement 2 is correct. The FIU-IND, established in 2004, plays a vital role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing.  Its collaboration with the ED (established in 1956) strengthens India's enforcement capabilities.  This statement accurately reflects the institutional framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The PMLA was enacted in 2002, not 1992. While the UAPA of 1967 addresses unlawful activities, its primary focus isn't solely on money laundering; it has a broader scope encompassing terrorism and other serious crimes. The inaccuracy in the year of PMLA's enactment and the imprecise description of UAPA's role make this statement flawed.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report actually highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The reversal of the order of cannabis and opioids is a significant factual error.

Statement 2 is correct. The report accurately identifies both the "Death Triangle" and the "Death Crescent" regions as significant areas for illicit drug production and trafficking. This statement correctly reflects the geographical distribution of drug production.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The number of US jurisdictions where cannabis is legalized is considerably higher than 10.  The underestimation significantly alters the accuracy of the statement. The provided number is far below the actual figure.


**3. With reference to India's participation in international counter-terrorism initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. India is a signatory to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), also known as the Palermo Convention, but has not ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption.

3.  India's election to the steering committee of the GlobE network demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts, while its role in the UN's Generation Justice initiative is limited.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is a signatory *and* has ratified the UNTOC.  Furthermore, India has also ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption. The statement incorrectly asserts that India has not ratified the latter.

Statement 2 is correct. SAWEN, a crucial regional initiative, indeed includes India as a key member, actively participating in efforts to combat wildlife crime, a significant aspect of transnational organized crime.

Statement 3 is largely correct. India's election to the GlobE steering committee showcases its commitment to global anti-corruption efforts. While the text doesn't explicitly detail the extent of India's involvement in Generation Justice,  it can be inferred that India's participation is likely not as prominent as its role in GlobE, making the statement largely accurate in its implication.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are largely correct.


**4.  With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and its activities, consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB), operational since 1995, reported over 200 incidents of nuclear material theft in 2023, involving more than 40 states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Yudh Abhyas is indeed a joint military exercise between India and the US. However, SALVEX is a joint naval exercise between India and the *United States*, not Russia. The incorrect pairing of countries makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  Vajra Prahar is accurately described as a joint army exercise between India and the US. Sea Defenders is also correctly identified as a maritime security exercise between the Indian Coast Guard and the US Coast Guard.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the *United States*, not France. Exercise Shakti is a joint military exercise between India and *France*, not the United States.  The incorrect pairing of countries in both parts of the statement renders it completely inaccurate.  Only statement 2 is entirely correct.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While cybercrime is a growing concern, it's not explicitly excluded from the overall assessment of a country's AML/CFT framework.  The evaluation considers the broader financial system vulnerabilities that could be exploited for illicit activities, which indirectly touches upon cybercrime aspects.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010.  Subsequent updates reflect the ongoing efforts by India to strengthen its AML/CFT regime and address any identified deficiencies.  The process is iterative, with periodic reviews and improvements to align with international standards.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. The FIU-IND plays a vital role in domestic AML/CFT efforts, but it also actively collaborates with international organizations through information sharing and mutual legal assistance to combat transnational financial crimes.  Its role is not limited to domestic investigations alone; it is a key component of India's international cooperation in this area.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's reports, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The geographic regions highlighted—the "Death Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) and the "Death Crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran)—remain significant areas of concern for illicit drug production.  The renaming reflects the severity of the drug problem in these regions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a broader scope than just Africa; it addresses global trends in illegal wildlife trade, examining various regions and species affected. While data limitations may exist in certain areas, the report strives for a comprehensive global perspective.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNODC does indeed act as the secretariat for UNTOC, and India is a party to the convention.  Furthermore, the UNODC actively supports and contributes to various regional initiatives, including SAWEN, which aims to combat wildlife crime in South Asia.  Its role extends beyond simply serving as a secretariat; it engages actively in practical collaborations and capacity-building efforts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

Statement 1 is incorrect. While economic cooperation is a significant part of India's SCO engagement, security and counter-terrorism are also crucial elements. The SCO's mandate explicitly includes these areas, and India actively participates in initiatives related to regional security and combating terrorism.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's participation in the G7 as an outreach country reflects its growing global role, and it actively engages in collaborative initiatives within the G7 framework.  The G7 often involves discussions and partnerships on various global issues, including those related to infrastructure, energy, and other areas where India has an interest.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While India's large population and financial contributions to the Commonwealth are significant factors, its engagement goes beyond these aspects.  India actively participates in various Commonwealth initiatives related to culture, development, and other areas of cooperation.  The Commonwealth provides a platform for multilateral diplomacy and collaboration on shared values and goals.


**4. With reference to cross-border energy cooperation in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's engagement with ASEAN encompasses a wide range of areas, including economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and security dialogues.  While security is a component of the relationship, it's not the sole or even primary focus.  Economic collaborations and people-to-people contacts are equally important.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting was held in Jakarta, not Singapore.  The meeting aimed to review the implementation of AITIGA and address various concerns related to trade facilitation and market access.  The focus was not solely on trade imbalances, but on a comprehensive review of the agreement's functioning.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is a crucial law in India's fight against money laundering. Statement 3 is incorrect.  FIU-IND's role is primarily intelligence gathering and dissemination, not direct prosecution.  Prosecution is handled by other agencies like the Enforcement Directorate (ED).

Statement 1 accurately reflects the unique situation in Bolivia where Sucre serves as the constitutional capital, while La Paz functions as the administrative capital. This division of governmental functions is a notable aspect of Bolivian governance. Statement 2 correctly lists Bolivia's landlocked neighbors; it's crucial to note that Bolivia does not border Colombia.  This geographical reality influences Bolivia's trade routes and international relations. Statement 3 is also accurate; Bolivia's historical reliance on the U.S. dollar has made its economy susceptible to global economic shifts. This dependence underscores the challenges Bolivia faces in managing its monetary policy and economic stability.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate and relevant information about Bolivia, making option (d) the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect as they fail to capture the complete picture of Bolivian geography, governance, and economic vulnerability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, and India is a major trading partner for Bangladesh.  However, the phrasing "largest trading partner in Asia" for India in relation to Bangladesh requires clarification. While India is a significant trading partner for Bangladesh,  it might not be the absolute largest across all of Asia. The statement is acceptable for a UPSC-level question if it intends to convey the significance of the bilateral trade relationship, even if the exact ranking might vary depending on the year and data source.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a significant role in investigating financial crimes, including money laundering, it was established in 1956, long before the specific focus on money laundering became a primary concern.  Its mandate has evolved over time to include these aspects, but its initial establishment predates the modern focus on combating money laundering.

Statement 3 is correct. NAM's vocal support for Cuba's removal from the list highlights its solidarity with member states facing unilateral sanctions and its commitment to principles of non-interference in internal affairs.  The inaccuracies in statements 1 and 2 serve as potent distractors, testing the candidate's knowledge of NAM's composition and the complexities of international relations, particularly concerning the application of unilateral sanctions.

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, with a particular focus on the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.
2. India's first MER was adopted in 2010, and it includes legislative frameworks such as the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, alongside institutional measures like the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND).
3.  The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating financial crimes, but it does not encompass cooperation with countries that lack robust anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The FATF MER does assess the mentioned areas, but the statement overemphasizes law enforcement.  The assessment is broader, encompassing legislative and regulatory frameworks, financial sector measures, and overall effectiveness.

Statement 2 is correct.  The information provided accurately reflects India's first MER adoption date and the key legislative and institutional components included in the evaluation.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the MLAT portal aims to enhance international cooperation, it doesn't explicitly exclude countries lacking robust AML/CFT frameworks.  The goal is to improve cooperation globally, even if the level of effectiveness varies across partners. The statement adds an unwarranted limitation to the portal's scope.


**3. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is envisioned as a crucial component of global connectivity, aiming to improve trade and transportation links between India, the Middle East, and Europe through various infrastructure projects.
2.  The IMEC's primary focus is on establishing new sea routes connecting major ports in India to those in the Middle East and Europe, thereby minimizing reliance on existing land-based transportation networks.
3. The IMEC initiative also includes plans for developing energy pipelines and other energy infrastructure projects to support the region's economic growth and enhance energy security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IMEC's conceptualization centers on enhancing global connectivity by fostering improved trade and transportation routes.  It's designed to be a cornerstone of global connectivity, aiming to reduce logistical bottlenecks and improve efficiency.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IMEC likely involves maritime transport, it's inaccurate to say its *primary* focus is on establishing entirely new sea routes. The corridor will likely utilize and improve existing routes and infrastructure while possibly adding new components for greater efficiency.

Statement 3 is plausible and likely correct.  While not explicitly stated in the provided text, the development of energy infrastructure (pipelines etc.) aligns with the overall goal of enhancing economic growth and security within the corridor.  Such infrastructure projects are a common component of large-scale economic corridors.


**4. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. Belarus's accession as the 10th member state of the SCO marks a significant expansion of the organization's geographical reach and influence.
2. The SCO's cooperation programs, such as the Anti-Drug Strategy for 2024-2029, primarily focus on addressing transnational crime and security challenges within the SCO member states, with little emphasis on economic cooperation.
3. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 aims to enhance economic cooperation among member states, including initiatives to improve infrastructure development and connectivity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Belarus joining the SCO is a significant development, expanding the organization's reach and geopolitical influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO does address security challenges, it also has a significant focus on economic cooperation.  The provided text mentions economic development strategies, suggesting a balance between security and economic goals.

Statement 3 is correct.  The long-term development strategy clearly aims to improve economic cooperation and connectivity among member states, which is a crucial aspect of the SCO's overall objectives.  Infrastructure development is a key component of such economic integration.


**5. Consider the following statements regarding the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC):**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter, adopted in 2022, grants BIMSTEC the status of an international organization with legal personality, enabling it to enter into agreements and treaties.
2. BIMSTEC's focus areas include trade, environment, security, agriculture, people-to-people contact, and connectivity, but it excludes any significant initiatives related to health and disaster management.
3.  The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity aims to improve regional transportation infrastructure and facilitate greater trade and people-to-people movement within the BIMSTEC region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The adoption of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2022 and its subsequent entry into force signifies BIMSTEC's transformation into an international organization with legal personality. This allows it to engage in international legal instruments.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The statement incorrectly claims that BIMSTEC excludes health and disaster management.  Disaster management exercises are explicitly mentioned in the provided text.  Health could be implicitly included under broader areas like agriculture and food security or people-to-people contact.

Statement 3 is correct. The mention of the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity clearly indicates a focus on improving regional infrastructure to facilitate trade and people-to-people movement.  This aligns with the broader goals of economic cooperation and regional integration.


**6.  With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) solely focuses on monitoring and reporting illicit nuclear trafficking incidents, excluding any data on accidental releases or security breaches at nuclear facilities.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero initiatives utilize nuclear techniques to improve food security and promote nuclear energy for achieving net-zero emissions, respectively.
3. The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program leverages nuclear science and technology to enhance the prevention, detection, and control of zoonotic diseases, complementing other public health initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ITDB primarily focuses on illicit trafficking, it’s unlikely to *solely* exclude accidental releases or security breaches.  Such events are relevant to nuclear safety and security, and the IAEA’s mandate likely covers them through other reporting mechanisms.  The statement presents an overly restrictive interpretation of the ITDB's scope.

Statement 2 is correct.  The descriptions of Atoms4Food and Atoms4NetZero accurately reflect the IAEA’s initiatives in using nuclear technology for food security and net-zero emission goals.

Statement 3 is correct.  The description of the Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program is accurate; the IAEA does utilize nuclear science to improve the management of zoonotic diseases.  This is a logical extension of its broader mandate in applying nuclear technology for beneficial purposes.


**7. With reference to the  United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cannabis is the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 primarily focuses on illegal wildlife trade in Africa and Asia, neglecting other regions due to data limitations.
3. The UNODC reports highlight the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Death Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand) as regions significantly impacted by drug trafficking and related criminal activities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The report's findings regarding cannabis being the most abused drug, followed by the other substances listed, is accurately reflected in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement incorrectly asserts that the report neglects other regions. While the report likely emphasizes regions with significant wildlife crime, it's highly unlikely to completely disregard other areas due to data limitations.  A comprehensive global report would include data from various regions, even if the level of detail varies.

Statement 3 is correct. The "Triple Frontier Area" and the "Death Triangle" are accurately identified as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking, as mentioned in the text.


**8. With reference to the  Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. The AFSPA, enacted in 1958, grants special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas" to maintain order and security, including the authority to arrest and search without warrants.
2. The AFSPA's application is restricted to specific regions within states, and its extension or revocation requires approval from the state legislative assemblies but not necessarily the central government.
3.  The AFSPA provides immunity to armed forces personnel from legal proceedings except with the prior sanction of the central government, which has been a subject of ongoing debate regarding human rights concerns.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The description of AFSPA's powers and its application in "disturbed areas" is accurately reflected in the provided text.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement is misleading because it incorrectly implies that the state legislative assemblies have the primary authority to approve extensions or revocations.  The central government plays a crucial role in this decision-making process.

Statement 3 is correct.  The immunity granted to armed forces personnel under AFSPA and the associated human rights concerns are accurately reflected in the text.  The central government's role in granting sanction for legal proceedings against personnel is a key controversial aspect of the act.



**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and subsequently updated in 2024, reflecting improvements in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.
3.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, and the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, are key institutions involved in India's anti-money laundering efforts, operating independently of each other without any coordination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  The FATF's MER does indeed assess measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. However, while cybercrime is a growing concern, it's not explicitly stated as being within the scope of this particular evaluation.  The focus remains primarily on the financial aspects of these threats.

Statement 2 is largely correct.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010. While the exact date of the 2024 update is not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, the text implies the existence of a recent update reflecting changes made in the intervening years to strengthen India's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The ED and FIU-IND are indeed key institutions in India's anti-money laundering efforts. However, they do not operate entirely independently. There is coordination and information sharing between the two bodies to ensure effective enforcement and investigation of financial crimes.  The FIU-IND serves as a central hub for financial intelligence, often collaborating with the ED in investigations.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are substantially correct. Statement 3 contains a factual inaccuracy regarding the operational independence of these two agencies.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, while cocaine and ecstasy are only found in limited regions.
2. The report identifies the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Golden Triangle" (Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, now renamed "Death Triangle") as regions significantly impacted by drug trafficking.
3.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024, released concurrently with the World Drug Day report, focuses exclusively on the illegal trade in endangered species and does not address the links between wildlife crime and other transnational organized crimes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The provided text clearly states that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The statement simplifies the information slightly by omitting amphetamines, but the core information regarding cannabis and opioids as the most prevalent remains accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The report correctly identifies the Triple Frontier Area and the Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle) as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking.  The text explicitly names these areas and their constituent countries.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the provided text focuses on the UNODC's release of two separate reports, it does not provide sufficient information to determine the exclusive focus of the World Wildlife Crime Report.  It is highly plausible that a report on wildlife crime would examine the links to other transnational organized crimes, given the frequent overlap between such activities.  The statement presents an assumption not supported by the given information.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are supported by the provided text.


**3. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7) initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure projects in developing countries, with a significant portion dedicated to renewable energy projects.
2.  The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while supporting clean energy projects, primarily focuses on attracting private sector investment and does not involve direct funding from G7 governments.
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) and the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition are initiatives that directly contradict each other, showcasing internal divisions within the G7 on environmental and energy policies.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The text mentions the PGII's aim to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027 for sustainable infrastructure in developing nations. While the exact breakdown of funding isn't specified, the emphasis on sustainable and quality infrastructure strongly implies a significant portion would be dedicated to renewable energy projects, aligning with global sustainable development goals.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses on facilitating access to *external* investment for clean energy projects. This implies that the initiative's role is primarily to create a favorable investment environment rather than directly providing funding from G7 governments.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text mentions the FSOI and the Oil Price Cap Coalition as separate initiatives. There is no information provided to suggest they inherently contradict each other. While they might address different aspects of energy and environmental policy,  it is not accurate to characterize them as contradictory without further evidence. It's important to avoid making assumptions about the internal dynamics of the G7 based on limited information.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are supported by the text.


**4. With reference to India's relations with Bangladesh, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, while India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  Military exercises like Sampriti and Milan are key components of the India-Bangladesh defence cooperation framework, supplemented by joint naval patrols in the Bay of Bengal.
3. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline is a significant energy cooperation project, but the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant's operational status is uncertain due to ongoing regulatory hurdles.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The text states that Bangladesh is India's biggest trade partner in South Asia, and India is the *second* biggest trade partner of Bangladesh in Asia.  The statement misrepresents the relative positions of the two countries in their respective trading relationships.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions military exercises like Sampriti and Milan as examples of defence cooperation between India and Bangladesh. While joint naval patrols aren't explicitly mentioned, the strong defence cooperation suggests their possibility.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. The text mentions both the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline and the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant. However, it makes no claim regarding any uncertainty about the operational status of the power plant. The statement introduces an unsupported assertion about regulatory hurdles.

Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct. Statement 1 contains a factual inaccuracy, and statement 3 introduces an unsubstantiated claim.


**5. With reference to the Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. The 2016 tripartite agreement between India, Iran, and Afghanistan for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port was primarily aimed at providing landlocked Afghanistan with access to the sea, bypassing Pakistan.
2.  Chabahar Port's location on the Gulf of Oman allows for shorter shipping routes to Central Asia compared to routes through the Suez Canal, significantly reducing transit times for goods destined for Afghanistan and other landlocked countries.
3.  The recent 10-year agreement between India and Iran for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal marks a significant shift in India's strategic focus away from Central Asia and towards Southeast Asia.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that the 2016 tripartite agreement aimed to provide a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan. This clearly indicates the primary objective was to facilitate Afghanistan's access to the sea.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights Chabahar's location on the Gulf of Oman and its role in providing a shorter sea route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, minimizing the need for routes through the Suez Canal. The shorter route implies reduced transit times for goods.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text focuses on strengthening India-Iran-Afghanistan relations through the port development.  There is no indication of a shift in India's strategic focus away from Central Asia. The statement presents a conclusion not supported by the text.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are supported by the given information.


**1. With reference to multinational maritime exercises involving the Indian Navy, consider the following statements:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint exercise among the Indian, Brazilian, and South African navies, focusing on humanitarian assistance and disaster relief (HADR) operations.
2. Exercise Cutlass Express, led by the U.S. Naval Forces, involves India and several African nations, primarily focusing on counter-piracy operations in the Indian Ocean.
3. RIMPAC, the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, includes India among its participants and emphasizes advanced naval warfare tactics and interoperability.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. IBSAMAR VIII is indeed a joint multinational maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa. However, while HADR is a component of such exercises, it's not the sole or primary focus.  These exercises typically cover a broader range of naval operations, including anti-submarine warfare, search and rescue, and maritime security cooperation.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Cutlass Express primarily involves the US Naval Forces and several African nations, focusing on enhancing maritime security and counter-piracy efforts within the African continent.  While the Indian Navy might participate occasionally, it's not a consistent or central participant.


Statement 3 is correct. RIMPAC (Rim of the Pacific Exercise) is indeed the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India is a regular participant. The exercise involves numerous nations and focuses on strengthening naval interoperability, improving communication, and promoting cooperation in various maritime domains.


**2. With reference to multinational air exercises involving the Indian Air Force, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Pitch Black, held biennially, is a multinational air exercise that includes India, focusing primarily on air-to-air combat and advanced air operations.
2. Exercise Desert Flag, a multilateral air exercise held in the UAE, involves the Indian Air Force and focuses on counter-terrorism tactics and joint air operations.
3. Exercise Eastern Bridge, conducted between the Indian Air Force and the Royal Air Force of Oman, emphasizes air-to-ground operations and close air support training.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Exercise Pitch Black is a large-scale, biennial multinational air exercise, but its emphasis is not solely on air-to-air combat, although that is a significant component. The exercise involves a wider range of air operations, including air-to-ground, and focuses on interoperability and cooperation among participating air forces. India's participation is not always guaranteed.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Desert Flag does involve several international air forces, but the Indian Air Force's consistent participation is not confirmed in the provided text.

Statement 3 is correct. Tiger Triumph 2024 is accurately described as a bilateral tri-service HADR amphibious exercise between India and the US.  The focus on joint amphibious operations and disaster response is consistent with the nature of such exercises.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the G4 nations:**

1. The G4 nations comprise Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, advocating for permanent seats on the UN Security Council.
2.  The Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group actively opposes the G4 nations' bid for permanent UNSC membership.
3.  Argentina, Canada, and Mexico are among the member states of the UfC, also known as the Coffee Club.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are factually accurate. The G4 nations – Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan – have consistently pushed for permanent seats on the UN Security Council, arguing for a more representative and effective global security body.  Their efforts, however, face opposition from the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group, a coalition of nations that believe the current UNSC reform proposals are insufficient or inappropriate. The UfC includes a diverse range of countries, and Argentina, Canada, and Mexico are indeed among its members. The UfC is also known informally as the "Coffee Club," highlighting its informal nature and frequent meetings. Therefore, all three statements accurately reflect the dynamics of the UN Security Council reform debate. Option (a) is incorrect because it omits the accurate statements 2 and 3. Option (b) incorrectly excludes statement 1. Option (c) excludes the accurate statement 3.


**2. With reference to the International Criminal Court (ICC), consider the following statements:**

1. The ICC's jurisdiction extends to crimes against humanity, war crimes, and genocide committed by individuals, regardless of their nationality or the location of the crime.
2. The ICC issued arrest warrants against Russia's President in March 2023 related to the situation in Ukraine.
3. Member states of the ICC are obligated to cooperate fully with the Court's investigations and arrest warrants, even if it means arresting their own citizens.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are correct. The ICC's mandate is to prosecute individuals for the gravest crimes under international law, including genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, irrespective of the perpetrator's nationality or the location of the crime. This principle of universality is a cornerstone of the ICC's jurisdiction.  The ICC did indeed issue arrest warrants against Russia's President in March 2023, concerning alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Ukraine.  This action underscores the Court's commitment to holding even high-ranking individuals accountable for international crimes. Finally, member states of the ICC are bound by the Rome Statute to cooperate fully with the Court's requests, including the execution of arrest warrants, even if it involves apprehending their own citizens.  Failure to cooperate can lead to sanctions and undermine the credibility of the international legal system.


**3. With reference to the BRICS New Development Bank (NDB), consider the following statements:**

1. The NDB, headquartered in Shanghai, China, focuses solely on financing infrastructure projects within BRICS nations.
2. The NDB's founding took place during the 6th BRICS Summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2014.
3.  All NDB member nations enjoy equal voting power and representation, aiming for a multipolar financial system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The NDB was indeed established during the 6th BRICS Summit in Fortaleza, Brazil, in 2014, with the goal of providing an alternative to Western-dominated financial institutions. A key principle of the NDB is the equal representation and voting power of all member nations (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), reflecting a desire to create a more balanced and multipolar global financial architecture.  However, statement 1 is incorrect. While the NDB prioritizes infrastructure projects, its mandate extends beyond BRICS nations to include other emerging economies as well, reflecting its broader ambition to contribute to global development.  The NDB's lending activities encompass a wider range of projects to support sustainable and inclusive growth in developing countries.


**4. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1. India joined the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996.
2. The ASEAN Future Forum, proposed by Vietnam, aims to facilitate the sharing of ideas and policy recommendations among ASEAN members and partner countries.
3. India is a founding member of the ASEAN Plus Three Cooperation, which includes ASEAN members, China, Japan, and South Korea.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 are correct. India did indeed join the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) in 1996, a significant step in its engagement with Southeast Asia. The ARF provides a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues.  The ASEAN Future Forum, proposed by Vietnam, is a relatively recent initiative designed to foster collaborative policy-making and idea exchange within the ASEAN framework and with partner countries.

2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, utilizing a standardized methodology across all evaluated nations.
3.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, are key legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing,  but don't address the financing of organized crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010, and the FATF's evaluation process involves a peer review by its member countries.  The methodology aims for consistency and comparability across assessments.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MER does assess measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's inaccurate to state that cybersecurity threats are explicitly excluded.  Although not the primary focus, the interconnectedness of financial crimes and cybercrime is increasingly recognized by the FATF, and indirectly, related aspects might be considered within the broader context of the evaluation.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The PMLA, 2002, and UAPA, 1967, are crucial in India's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing efforts. However, the statement's claim that they *don't* address the financing of organized crime is false.  While not their sole focus, both acts have provisions that indirectly or directly impact the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes linked to organized criminal activities.  The overlap between terrorist financing and organized crime is significant, making it difficult to completely separate these legal frameworks from the broader issue of organized crime financing.

3. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on the illegal wildlife trade in Africa, neglecting other global regions significantly affected by this crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is accurate. The UNODC does indeed identify the regions formerly known as the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent (now renamed Death Triangle and Death Crescent, respectively) as major hubs for drug production and trafficking.  These geographic areas are consistently highlighted in their reports due to the significant volume of illicit drug activity emanating from them.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's reports consistently show cannabis as the most widely used drug globally,  followed by other substances like opioids.  Cocaine is a significant concern, particularly in certain regions, but it does not consistently rank as the most abused globally.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope,  addressing the illegal wildlife trade across various regions, including but not limited to Africa.  It would be a significant oversight to focus solely on one continent when the problem is worldwide.

Statement 1 is inaccurate. The NAM's position on Cuba likely stems from a combination of factors, including geopolitical considerations, concerns about the impact of sanctions on the Cuban population, and a broader commitment to principles of sovereignty and non-interference.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2007 renewal of the 1949 treaty reaffirmed the existing framework of cooperation, it did not significantly shift the power dynamics.  While Bhutan has gained greater autonomy in some areas, the fundamental nature of the relationship remains largely unchanged.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The BRO's road construction projects in Bhutan are spread across various regions, not solely focused on the east. The project 'DANTAK' has built a significant portion of Bhutan's road network across the country.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Gelephu Mindfulness City project primarily aims to improve connectivity between Bhutan and India's Assam, not Bangladesh. While improved connectivity with India could indirectly benefit trade with other nations, the city's direct focus is on the India-Bhutan border.

2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and the process involves peer review by FATF members, with the latest review highlighting significant improvements in India's anti-money laundering framework.
3.  The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is the primary institution responsible for receiving, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence related to money laundering and terrorist financing, and it works independently of the Directorate of Enforcement (ED).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the FATF's MER explicitly includes the assessment of measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While cybercrime is a growing concern, it's not currently a primary focus within the scope of the standard MER.

Statement 2 is correct. India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010, and the process involves a peer review by FATF members.  While the provided text doesn't detail the specifics of the latest review, the fact that India's measures are regularly assessed and improved upon is a key element of FATF's function.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While FIU-IND is indeed responsible for financial intelligence gathering and dissemination,  it does work in coordination with agencies like the ED, which is responsible for enforcement actions based on the intelligence provided.  They are not entirely independent entities.  The ED's much earlier establishment (1956) also indicates a broader role beyond just anti-money laundering, although it plays a key part in the overall framework.


**2. With reference to the UNODC's reports on drug abuse and wildlife crime, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report clearly states that cannabis is the *most* abused drug globally, not cocaine.  The ranking of other drugs is also correctly stated, but the concentration of abuse is not solely in the Golden Triangle and Golden Crescent; the report mentions other regions as well.

Statement 2 is correct.  The report directly addresses the legalization of cannabis in various jurisdictions and its implications.

Statement 3 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Golden Triangle, now often called the Death Triangle, consists of Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.  Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran constitute the Golden Crescent, also known as the Death Crescent.  This geographical distinction is crucial for understanding the different drug trafficking networks and production hubs. The confusion between these two regions is a common misconception, making this a challenging distractor in the question.

Statement 2 is correct.  Canada, Uruguay, and a significant number of US jurisdictions (more than 20) have legalized cannabis, highlighting the evolving global landscape of drug policy and the varying approaches to cannabis regulation.  The exact number of US jurisdictions can fluctuate, making a precise number a potential distractor, but the core fact of legalization in these countries remains true.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the INCB is a crucial international body in drug control, its headquarters is not in Vienna, Austria.  The precise location is a detail that requires specific knowledge, making this a good distractor for candidates who may have a general understanding of the INCB but lack the precise details of its location.

This slight alteration in the date serves as a subtle yet effective distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of the convention's adoption year.  The fact that India ratified it is correct, but the incorrect year makes the entire statement false.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC's role as the secretariat for UNTOC and its oversight of initiatives like the GFP are accurate. This statement tests the candidate's understanding of the UNODC's structure and functions within the international framework for combating transnational crime.

Statement 3 is incorrect. SAWEN was established in 2011, not 2001.  This error in the establishment year acts as a distractor, testing the candidate's knowledge of the timeline of regional initiatives in combating wildlife crime.  The fact that India is a member is correct, but the incorrect year renders the statement false.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

The FATF's mandate is broader than just money laundering and terrorist financing; it also encompasses the prevention of the financing of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's first MER was indeed adopted in 2010, and the PMLA, 2002, forms a cornerstone of India's legal framework to combat money laundering.  This Act provides the legal basis for investigating and prosecuting money laundering offenses.

Statement 2 is correct. The definition of an ISO precisely reflects the diverse composition of personnel drawn from different branches of the armed forces, emphasizing the integrated nature of these organizations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Andaman and Nicobar Command and the Strategic Forces Command are tri-services commands, they fall under the purview of the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, as they are bodies of troops composed of personnel from different services.  The Act's application is not limited to specific commands.

Its primary aim is to mobilize resources for infrastructure and sustainable development projects in BRICS and other emerging economies, promoting a more multipolar and equitable global financial system.  The bank aims to provide an alternative to Western-dominated institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

Statement 2 is also correct. The BRICS Grain Exchange is a Russian-led initiative aiming to create a more fair and efficient trading system for agricultural products within the BRICS nations. This initiative aims to improve food security and reduce reliance on global markets dominated by a few players, particularly important given the geopolitical complexities affecting global food supply chains.  The focus is on equitable trade practices and reducing price volatility.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI) or BRICS Pay is *not* a centralized payment system relying on traditional banking infrastructure.  Instead, it leverages blockchain technology to create a decentralized and more secure payment system.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.

The ARF provides a platform for dialogue and cooperation on a wide range of security challenges facing the region.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The ASEAN Future Forum, while indeed proposed by Vietnam in 2023 and serving as a platform for sharing ideas and policy recommendations, is *not* exclusively focused on security issues. It encompasses a broader range of topics relevant to ASEAN and its partners, including economic and social development.  The forum aims to foster innovation and collaboration on various aspects of regional cooperation.

Statement 3 is correct. India's active participation in the ADMM+ and EAMF clearly demonstrates its commitment to regional security and maritime cooperation within the ASEAN framework.

The statement correctly points out the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund's role in integrating Indian companies into global value chains.

Statement 2 is correct. The three bodies—Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and Labor Rights Advisory Board—were indeed established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement, and India's election as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council reflects its active participation in shaping regional supply chain resilience.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPEF Upskilling Initiative targets women and girls in *emerging* economies, not developed ones. The goal is to bridge the digital skills gap in these nations and empower women through digital literacy and employment opportunities in the growing digital economy.  The focus is on capacity building and inclusive growth.

While it covers a broad range of naval operations, the focus extends beyond anti-submarine warfare and amphibious operations to include a wider spectrum of maritime security cooperation, including information sharing and joint tactical exercises.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While IBSAMAR VIII is a joint multinational maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa, its emphasis is not solely on HADR.  The exercise covers a wider range of naval operations, including maritime security, search and rescue, and anti-piracy operations.  HADR is a component, but not the primary focus.

Statement 3 is correct. Exercise Pitch Black is a biennial multinational air exercise in which India participates, focusing on enhancing interoperability in complex air combat scenarios and large-scale air operations.  The exercise provides valuable training opportunities for aircrews and improves coordination among participating nations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. Sittwe Port is indeed a deep-water port, not shallow-water, situated at the estuary of the Kaladan River, not the Irrawaddy River.  Its strategic location enhances trade and transit opportunities for India's Northeast, but its impact extends primarily to India and Myanmar, not necessarily to broader Southeast Asia.  Statement 2 is incorrect because obtaining operational rights for Sittwe Port involves complex geopolitical considerations and may involve multilateral discussions, not solely bilateral agreements with Myanmar.  The other options are incorrect due to the inaccuracies mentioned regarding the port's water depth, river location and the scope of its trade benefits.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The 1974 agreement definitively assigned Saint Martin's Island to Bangladesh.  Statement 1 is incorrect because Saint Martin's Island is not the largest coral island in the Bay of Bengal and is solely under Bangladeshi administration. Statement 2 is also incorrect as the island is located in the northeastern part of the Bay of Bengal, not the southwest, and while it holds some strategic importance, it's not primarily due to its proximity to major shipping lanes in the same way some other islands might. The question tests knowledge of the island's precise location and the nature of its sovereignty agreement.

Statement 1 is misleading; while the 1949 treaty does exist and was renewed in 2007, it doesn't grant India *significant* influence over Bhutan's foreign policy in the way the statement suggests. The phrasing is designed to be a distractor. This question tests understanding of the nuances of the India-Bhutan relationship.


**11. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's "India Out" campaign aimed to strengthen its ties with the Maldives by promoting economic cooperation and countering Chinese influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statements 2 and 3 are correct. The CSA is a key financial arrangement between the two nations. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure initiative. Statement 1 is incorrect because the "India Out" campaign was a movement in the Maldives against Indian influence, not an Indian initiative to strengthen ties.  This question tests knowledge of recent developments in India-Maldives relations.


**12. With reference to India-China relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Line of Actual Control (LAC) between India and China is a formally demarcated border, clearly defined in international agreements and maps.
2.  Disengagement in areas of friction in eastern Ladakh, such as Galwan, Hot Springs, Gogra, and Pangong Tso, has been fully completed as per recent agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. The LAC is not formally demarcated; this is a point of contention. While disengagement has occurred in some areas, it's not fully completed across all friction points.  China's claims in the Western Sector are indeed based on the Macartney-MacDonald Line, while India primarily uses the Johnson Line. This question tests understanding of the complexities of the India-China border dispute.

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is entirely correct. Chabahar Port's strategic location and its role in providing India with alternative access to Afghanistan and Central Asia are accurate.  Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect because  the development of Chabahar Port involves multiple stakeholders, not solely bilateral agreements with Iran, and  while it aims to enhance trade with Afghanistan, a substantial increase in bilateral trade volume hasn't yet been fully realized.  This question tests knowledge of the Chabahar Port's geopolitical significance.

**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS):**

1. The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functions as its secretary, but does not command any military forces directly.
2.  The CDS is the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and a member of both the Defence Acquisition Council and the Defence Planning Committee.
3. The creation of the CDS post was initially recommended by a Group of Ministers (GoM) in 2001, based on the Shri K Subrahmanyam Committee Report, and the post was finally established in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect aspects of the CDS's role and the history of the position's creation.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the CDS's position as head of the DMA and secretary, emphasizing the crucial advisory role rather than direct command authority over the service chiefs. The CDS acts as the principal military advisor, coordinating inter-service matters. Statement 2 accurately describes the CDS's membership in key defence committees, highlighting their role in policy-making and acquisition processes.  Statement 3 correctly notes the GoM recommendation in 2001 based on the Subrahmanyam Committee report, which preceded the eventual establishment of the post in 2019.  There is no contradiction or inaccuracy in any of the statements.


**2. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS is a part of the larger National Security Council (NSC), which was constituted in 1998 based on recommendations from a task force led by K.C. Pant.
2.  The NSC comprises the Prime Minister, Ministers of Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs, and is an apex advisory body on national security.
3. The NSCS houses the Strategic Policy Group (SPG), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), which is responsible for long-term analysis and policy recommendations to the NSC.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is entirely accurate. The NSC is indeed an apex advisory body with the composition as described. Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the NSC was constituted in 1999 based on K.C. Pant-led task force recommendations, the year is slightly off.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the Strategic Policy Group (SPG) is responsible for inter-ministerial coordination, not long-term analysis and policy recommendations. That function belongs to the National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), also headed by the NSA. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**3. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) disciplinary powers over personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, but not the Army Act, 1950, or the Navy Act, 1957.
2.  An ISO is defined as a body of troops, including a Joint Services Command, consisting of persons subject to any two of the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957.
3. The Act aims to streamline administrative processes within ISOs, but does not explicitly address disciplinary matters.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the Act grants the C-i-C and O-i-C disciplinary powers over personnel subject to *all three* Acts (Air Force, Army, and Navy), not just the Air Force Act. Statement 2 is correct; the Act defines ISOs precisely as described. Statement 3 is incorrect because the primary purpose of the Act is to empower the C-i-C and O-i-C with disciplinary and administrative powers. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about the Kargil War and Operation Vijay:**

1. Operation Vijay was launched to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants who had infiltrated the Siachen Glacier region of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Operation Safed Sagar, conducted by the Indian Air Force, targeted Pakistani troops in low-altitude positions in the Kargil sector.
3. Key locations involved in Operation Vijay included Tololing, Tiger Hill, Batalik, and the Drass sector.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the infiltration occurred in the Kargil district, not the Siachen Glacier. Statement 2 is incorrect because Operation Safed Sagar targeted high-altitude positions, not low-altitude ones. Statement 3 is correct; these locations were indeed key battlegrounds during Operation Vijay.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**5. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of any weapons in space, including conventional weapons.
2. Weaponization of space refers solely to the deployment of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in outer space.
3. Militarization of space involves using space-based assets to support military operations on Earth without necessarily deploying weapons in space.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on the Moon, or on other celestial bodies, but it does not explicitly ban all weapons. Statement 2 is incorrect as weaponization encompasses a broader range of weapons beyond WMDs. Statement 3 accurately defines militarization of space.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**6. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC came into force in 1995 and currently has 193 states parties.
2. The CWC secretariat is located in Geneva, Switzerland, and is responsible for implementing the convention.
3. India is not an original signatory to the CWC.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CWC came into force in 1997, not 1995. Statement 2 is incorrect; the CWC secretariat is located in The Hague, Netherlands, not Geneva. Statement 3 is incorrect; India is indeed an original signatory to the CWC.  Therefore, none of the statements are correct.


**7. Consider the following statements about the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) reports exclusively on incidents of nuclear material theft within member states.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve food security by focusing solely on increasing crop yields.
3. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes nuclear energy as a means to achieve net-zero emissions, but also considers the role of renewable energy sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the ITDB reports on incidents globally, not just within member states.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Atoms4Food has a broader scope than just increasing crop yields; it encompasses various applications of nuclear technology in agriculture. Statement 3 is correct; Atoms4NetZero acknowledges the role of both nuclear and renewable energy in achieving net-zero emissions. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**8. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and its Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments across five pillars, and India was ranked in the top 10 countries.
2.  According to the GCI 2024, most countries are categorized as either “establishing” (Tier 3) or “evolving” (Tier 4) in their digital services expansion.
3. The ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, responsible for regulating international telecommunications and setting technical standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while India is a role model country (Tier 1), the statement incorrectly claims a top 10 ranking.  Statement 2 is correct, reflecting the GCI's findings on most countries' digital services expansion. Statement 3 is also correct; the ITU's role is accurately described. Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**9. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda, the first operation conducted under CMF, involved the seizure of narcotics in the Arabian Sea.
2. The CMF is a multinational naval coalition primarily focused on counter-terrorism operations in the Indian Ocean region.
3. India joined the CMF in 2021, expanding its participation in international maritime security initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct, accurately describing the Indian Navy's involvement in Operation Crimson Barracuda and the seizure of drugs. Statement 2 is largely correct, though the CMF's focus also extends to other maritime security issues. Statement 3 is incorrect; India joined the CMF in 2022, not 2021. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are predominantly correct.


**10. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces in "disturbed areas," allowing them to open fire, arrest without warrants, and conduct searches without prior sanction.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, and Arunachal Pradesh, but not in Jammu and Kashmir.
3. The declaration of a "disturbed area" under AFSPA is made by the Chief Minister of the respective state or union territory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct, though it simplifies the legal process and conditions under which these powers can be used. Statement 2 is incorrect; AFSPA remains in force in Jammu and Kashmir through a separate act. Statement 3 is incorrect; the declaration is made by the Governor of the state, the administrator of the Union Territory, or by the central government.  Therefore, only statement 1 is mostly correct.



**1. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade relations between India and European Union member states.
2.  The IMEC initiative aims to significantly reduce transportation costs for goods moving between India, the Middle East, and Europe.
3. The development of IMEC is expected to foster stronger diplomatic ties between India and Middle Eastern nations.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

While IMEC does involve Europe, its primary focus is on creating a more efficient and integrated trade route connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe.  Statement 1 is partially true but oversimplifies the corridor's scope. The core objective is to improve connectivity and reduce logistical challenges, leading to lower transportation costs (statement 2). This enhanced connectivity will naturally strengthen diplomatic and economic relationships between India and Middle Eastern countries (statement 3).  The corridor's success depends on fostering cooperation across multiple nations, and it's not solely focused on any single trading bloc.


**2. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary objective is to counter the influence of NATO in Central Asia.
2.  All SCO member states are located in Asia.
3.  The SCO has a robust mechanism for enforcing its decisions on member states.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The SCO's aims are broader than simply countering NATO; it focuses on security cooperation, economic development, and cultural exchange among its members (statement 1 is incorrect).  Belarus's membership expands the SCO's geographical reach beyond Asia (statement 2 is incorrect). The SCO operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, lacking a centralized enforcement mechanism (statement 3 is incorrect).  Its effectiveness relies on the willingness of its members to cooperate, which is not always guaranteed.


**3. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 summit always takes place in the same location each year.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to solely fund energy projects in developing nations.
3.  All G7 member states are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The G7 presidency rotates annually among its members, changing the summit's location (statement 1 is incorrect).  The PGII's scope is broader than just energy projects; it encompasses various sustainable infrastructure initiatives (statement 2 is incorrect). While many G7 members are also UNSC permanent members, this is not a requirement for G7 membership (statement 3 is incorrect).  The G7's focus is primarily on economic and geopolitical issues among its developed member states.


**4. With reference to India-GCC relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India has a significant trade surplus with the GCC countries.
2. The majority of the Non-Resident Indian (NRI) population resides outside of GCC countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

India currently faces a trade deficit with the GCC, not a surplus (statement 1 is incorrect). A large portion of the NRI population lives in GCC countries (statement 2 is incorrect).  GCC nations contribute significantly more than 25% to India’s oil imports (statement 3 is incorrect). The close economic ties between India and GCC nations are vital for India's energy security and economic growth.


**5. With reference to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Ukraine is currently a full member of NATO.
2.  NATO's funding is solely based on the contributions of its European member states.
3.  NATO operates a Partnership for Peace program aimed at fostering cooperation with non-member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Ukraine is not yet a NATO member, despite its application (statement 1 is incorrect). NATO's funding comes from all its member states, both European and North American (statement 2 is incorrect).  The Partnership for Peace program is a key initiative to engage and cooperate with non-member states (statement 3 is correct).  NATO's role in maintaining transatlantic security and its expanding partnerships are crucial aspects of global geopolitics.


**6. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2005.
2. India has a trade surplus with ASEAN under AITIGA.
3. AITIGA's primary objective is to eliminate all trade barriers between India and ASEAN member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2005 (statement 1 is incorrect). India currently has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus (statement 2 is incorrect).  While AITIGA aims to reduce trade barriers, it doesn't eliminate them entirely (statement 3 is incorrect).  The agreement represents a significant step towards increased economic integration but doesn't lead to complete free trade.


**7. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. SAARC decisions are made based on a majority vote system.
2. The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement was signed in 2000.
3.  SAARC has been consistently highly effective in promoting regional cooperation since its inception.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

SAARC decisions require unanimous consent, not a majority vote (statement 1 is incorrect). SAFTA was signed in 2006, not 2000 (statement 2 is incorrect).  SAARC's effectiveness has been hampered by various political and bilateral issues, leading to periods of inactivity (statement 3 is incorrect).  Understanding the challenges faced by SAARC in achieving its objectives is crucial for assessing regional cooperation in South Asia.


**8. With reference to India’s initiatives for the Global South, consider the following statements:**

1. The Social Impact Fund contributes $15 million to digital infrastructure development.
2. The Global South Young Diplomat Forum focuses solely on providing scholarships.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

The Social Impact Fund's contribution is $25 million, not $15 million (statement 1 is incorrect). The Global South Young Diplomat Forum's activities extend beyond scholarships to include capacity building and educational programs (statement 2 is incorrect).  "Vision of Aarogya Maitri" encompasses a broader approach to health security than just financial aid, including cooperation and knowledge sharing (statement 3 is incorrect).  India's engagement with the Global South is multifaceted and includes various developmental and diplomatic initiatives.


**9. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative (IPOI), consider the following statements:**

1. IPOI is a legally binding treaty among participating nations.
2. IPOI was launched in 2018.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

IPOI is a non-treaty based voluntary arrangement (statement 1 is incorrect). IPOI was launched in 2019, not 2018 (statement 2 is incorrect).  IPOI directly builds upon and expands the principles of India's SAGAR initiative (statement 3 is correct).  Understanding IPOI's voluntary nature and its connection to SAGAR is essential for comprehending India's strategic vision for the Indo-Pacific region.


**10. With reference to the India-EFTA Trade and Economic Partnership Agreement (TEPA), consider the following statements:**

1. EFTA is a customs union similar to the European Union.
2. TEPA aims to establish a common external tariff for all EFTA and Indian goods.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

Statement 2 is correct. The three bodies mentioned – Supply Chain Council, Crisis Response Network, and Labor Rights Advisory Board – are accurately described as established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the IPEF aims to strengthen regional supply chains, the text does not mention a specific priority on establishing new manufacturing facilities or a particular focus on renewable energy technologies.  The statement adds details not supported by the given information.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India was the *highest*, not the second-highest, contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, as per the SIPRI report.  This highlights India's significant commitment to international peace and security.  The question attempts to mislead by suggesting a lower contribution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East. This reflects the ongoing conflicts and instability in that region, requiring substantial international intervention. The option tries to create confusion by offering a geographically plausible but factually incorrect alternative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the SIPRI report analyzed trends in multilateral peace operations, it didn't necessarily indicate a *significant decrease* in global operations. The phrasing is designed to be ambiguous and create doubt, even if the overall number of operations might have fluctuated.  The nuance of the report's findings is deliberately obscured.

1.  Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint air force exercise held biennially between India and the USA.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a *joint military exercise* (involving army and air force components), held *annually*, not biennially, between India and the USA. The question tries to create confusion by altering the frequency and scope of the exercise.

Statement 2 is correct. SALVEX is indeed a joint naval exercise between India and the USA, though the frequency might not be specified in all sources.  The statement accurately reflects the nature of the exercise.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Exercise Vajra Prahar is a *joint army exercise* between India and the USA, but its frequency isn't necessarily every three years; the exact frequency might vary.  The question plays with the frequency to create a distractor.

(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Jagjit Pavadia was re-elected for a *third* term, not a second, running from 2025 to 2030. The alteration in the number of terms is designed to be a subtle but effective distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB deals with controlled substances, including cannabis, its mandate is broader, encompassing the control of all drugs under the international drug control conventions. The statement oversimplifies the INCB’s role.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text does not mention India being on the INCB's steering committee; it only highlights Pavadia's re-election.  The statement introduces a plausible but ultimately false connection.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the CCPCJ addresses various crime issues, its 33rd session focused on combating *transnational organized crime (TOC)*,  not exclusively cybercrime. The question tries to mislead with a related but different focus area.

Statement 2 is correct. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative is accurately described in the provided text as aiming to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) is indeed *legally binding* on states that ratify it, as explicitly stated.  The question attempts to create doubt by suggesting it lacks legal force.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GlobE addresses various aspects of corruption, its focus is not limited to terrorism financing.  The statement creates a misleadingly specific focus.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the steering committee demonstrates its commitment to international anti-corruption cooperation, as the text clearly states.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The provided text doesn't indicate that GlobE is a subsidiary of UNODC; it simply mentions UNODC as a separate entity involved in anti-crime initiatives.  The question creates a false hierarchical relationship.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an *air operation* conducted by the Indian Air Force, not a naval operation. The question swaps the branches of the military involved.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Talwar was a naval operation, not an air operation. The question again swaps the branches of military involved.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam, not A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.  The question substitutes a well-known figure to create a plausible distractor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1967 Outer Space Treaty *bans* the placement of weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) in orbit, on the Moon, or on other celestial bodies.  The question presents the opposite of the treaty's intent.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While Russia raised concerns about various aspects of the proposed resolution, the text doesn't specifically highlight ambiguity regarding surveillance technologies as the primary reason for the veto. The statement introduces a plausible but unsubstantiated detail.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Militarization of space encompasses a broader range of activities, including the use of space for military operations and intelligence gathering, not only weapons deployment. The question narrows the definition to create a misleadingly restrictive interpretation.

2. The Union Finance Minister's request to the AIIB was specifically for assistance in developing renewable energy infrastructure in low-income countries.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 2 and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The AIIB's focus is on providing financial assistance to *low-income* countries, not high-income countries, for infrastructure development. The question reverses the target beneficiary group.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the request was to help low-income countries access resources, the text doesn't specify that it was solely for renewable energy infrastructure. The statement adds a specific and unsubstantiated detail to the request.

Statement 3 is correct. The AIIB is indeed a multilateral development bank headquartered in Beijing.

Statement 2 is correct. While the Arab League addresses political and security issues, economic cooperation is a significant part of its mandate.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While many members overlap, not all members of the Arab League are members of the OIC.  The statement creates a false assumption about complete membership overlap.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that the ITDB reported 168 incidents in 2023, but it doesn't provide comparative data for previous years to confirm a decrease. The question introduces a comparative element not supported by the text.

Statement 2 is correct.  The description of the Atoms4Food program accurately reflects its focus on using nuclear techniques for improved food security.

Statement 3 is correct. The IAEA is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2
(d) 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)


**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments across five pillars, which likely include legal and regulatory aspects. The statement creates a misleadingly narrow interpretation of the index's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The text only states that India is among the "role modelling" countries (Tier 1), it doesn't specify a top-three ranking. The question inflates India's position in the ranking.

Statement 3 is correct. The ITU is a specialized agency of the United Nations.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text explicitly states that Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first such operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF.

Statement 2 is correct. Combating piracy and terrorism is a core mandate of the CMF, although it likely addresses other maritime security challenges as well.

Statement 2 is correct. The AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces in areas declared "disturbed" under specific conditions.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text only mentions the *extension* of AFSPA, not its permanent nature.  The extension is likely for a specified period, subject to review.  The question creates a false sense of permanence.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is a matter of public record.  The INCB plays a crucial role in international drug control, and India's continued presence on the board underscores its commitment to this area.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB does indirectly impact the pharmaceutical trade through its oversight of controlled substances, its main focus is on the international control of drugs and precursors, with a strong emphasis on preventing illicit trafficking and abuse.  Regulation of the global legal pharmaceutical trade falls under different international bodies and national regulatory frameworks.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The INCB is not a specialized agency of the UN responsible for enforcing the UN Convention Against Corruption.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) plays a significant role in the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption, but the INCB's mandate is specific to drug control.

The Generation Justice initiative was specifically launched to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice, recognizing the importance of youth participation in building safer and more just societies.  This aligns with broader UN efforts to promote youth engagement in global governance.

Statement 3 is correct. The CCPCJ is indeed a subsidiary body of ECOSOC, reflecting its role in addressing crime prevention and criminal justice matters within the broader UN system.  This placement within ECOSOC highlights the social and economic dimensions of crime.

The ITU's GCI 2024 provides a comprehensive assessment of a nation's cybersecurity capabilities, encompassing not just technological aspects but also legal, regulatory, and organizational elements.  The index considers a range of factors influencing cybersecurity readiness, including policy frameworks, legal and regulatory environments, and technical infrastructure.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While India is indeed a role model country in the GCI 2024, placing it in Tier 1,  the statement incorrectly suggests a top 10 global ranking.  The  "role model" designation reflects a strong commitment to cybersecurity across all five pillars, but the exact numerical ranking within Tier 1 isn't specified by this.  The number of countries in Tier 1 is mentioned, but not a specific ranking within that tier.

Statement 3 is correct.  The GCI 2024 employs a tiered system to categorize countries according to their cybersecurity maturity. Tier 1 represents countries that exhibit a strong commitment to all five cybersecurity pillars, indicating a high level of preparedness.  This tiered structure allows for a nuanced understanding of cybersecurity capabilities across different nations.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes cybercrime.
2. India's MER, first adopted in 2010, undergoes a peer review process every 10 years by FATF members.
3.  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, are key legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the FATF's MER focuses on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's not explicitly stated to exclude cybercrime.  The focus is on the core areas, but the overall goal of preventing financial crimes could encompass other related areas, including cybercrime, which is increasingly linked to money laundering and terrorist financing.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The statement implies a fixed 10-year review cycle for India’s MER, which isn't necessarily true.  While the initial adoption was in 2010, the frequency and timing of subsequent reviews are determined by the FATF's processes and may not adhere to a strict 10-year schedule. The process is dynamic and depends on various factors.

Statement 3 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are indeed crucial legal instruments employed by India to address money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively. These acts provide the legal framework for investigations, prosecutions, and asset seizures related to these financial crimes.


**4. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights that amphetamines are the most abused drug globally, surpassing cannabis.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade in Africa, neglecting other regions.
3. The UNODC's reports identify the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") and "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") as significant regions affected by drug production and trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. According to the UNODC's World Drug Day report, cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.  The statement reverses the order of the most abused substances.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 covers global trends in illegal wildlife trade, not focusing solely on Africa. While Africa is a significant region affected by wildlife crime, the report provides a broader analysis of the issue across various continents and regions.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNODC's reports correctly identify the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") and "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") as major regions involved in drug production and trafficking. These regions are known for their historical and ongoing involvement in the cultivation and trade of illicit drugs.


**5. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd Session focused solely on combating cybercrime, neglecting other forms of transnational organized crime (TOC).
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative launched by the CCPCJ aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice, but excludes educational programs.
3. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention), is a key mechanism used to tackle TOC, and India is a signatory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCPCJ's 33rd Session addressed a broader range of issues related to transnational organized crime, not just cybercrime. While cybercrime is a significant concern, the session's agenda likely included other forms of TOC as well.  The focus was on a holistic approach to crime prevention.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The GenJust initiative, while focused on youth engagement, likely incorporates educational programs as a key component of its strategy.  Engaging youth effectively in crime prevention and criminal justice often involves educational initiatives to raise awareness and promote positive participation.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNTOC, 2000 (Palermo Convention), is a crucial international legal instrument for tackling TOC, and India is indeed a signatory to this convention.  This convention provides a framework for international cooperation in combating various forms of organized crime.




**1. With reference to the India-Maldives relationship, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives advocated for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel and the adoption of pro-China policies.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was a significant event reflecting a shift in political sentiment towards closer ties with China. This campaign directly challenged India's influence in the Maldives.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Neer (2014) was an Indian initiative to provide *water* assistance to the Maldives during a water crisis, not medical assistance.  The initiative focused on addressing the immediate need for potable water.  Vaccine Maitri was the initiative related to medical assistance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Statement 3 is correct. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is indeed a large-scale infrastructure project undertaken with significant Indian investment and collaboration.  It represents a substantial contribution to the Maldives' infrastructure development.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline originates in the Galkynysh gas field, one of the world's largest natural gas fields, located in Turkmenistan.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the overall distance is substantial, the pipeline's length is closer to 1,800 km, not 1,500 km.  The slight discrepancy is a common point of confusion and makes it a good distractor.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The TAPI pipeline transports *natural gas*, not liquefied natural gas (LNG). LNG requires specialized liquefaction and regasification processes, which are not part of the TAPI infrastructure.  This distinction is crucial for understanding the technical aspects of the pipeline project.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage explicitly mentions India's recent chairmanship of the Colombo Process. This fact is directly stated and easily verifiable.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Colombo Process is not limited to South Asian countries; it involves a wider range of stakeholders and participating nations across the region and beyond.  The regional scope is more extensive than implied in the statement.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.

**3. With reference to India's relations with Bangladesh, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  Key aspects of India-Bangladesh defense cooperation include military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN, and the recent addition of Bangladesh to the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.
3.  Enhanced connectivity initiatives between India and Bangladesh include the operationalization of the Agreement for the usage of Chittagong and Mongla Ports, but exclude any initiatives related to inland waterways.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text states that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, but India is only the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest. This subtle difference makes the statement inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct.  The passage clearly mentions SAMPRITI and MILAN as examples of defense cooperation and notes Bangladesh's recent joining of the Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text specifically mentions the operationalization of the Agreement for the usage of Chittagong and Mongla Ports *and* the Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) as examples of enhanced connectivity initiatives.  The statement wrongly excludes the inland waterways aspect.

Therefore, only statement 2 is fully correct.


**4.  With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB's mandate includes monitoring the implementation of international drug control treaties, but excludes any role in coordinating global anti-drug campaigns or initiatives.
2.  India's Jagjit Pavadia has been elected to the INCB for a third term, spanning from 2025 to 2030.  This term is his final term on the INCB.
3. The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), responsible for advising the UN General Assembly on matters related to drug control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INCB's primary role is monitoring treaty implementation, it's inaccurate to say it has *no* role in coordinating global initiatives.  Its work inherently involves influencing and shaping global anti-drug efforts, even if it doesn't directly lead large-scale campaigns.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The text states that Pavadia was re-elected for a *third* term, but it does *not* state that this is his final term.  There's no information supporting this claim.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The INCB is an independent body, not a subsidiary of the UNODC.  While both organizations work within the broader UN system to combat drug trafficking, the INCB has a distinct legal and operational structure.  The statement misrepresents the INCB's relationship with the UNODC.

Therefore, none of the statements are completely accurate.


**5. With reference to India's participation in international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India is a member of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which recently admitted Belarus as its tenth member, but India is not a member of the Group of Seven (G7).
2. India's participation in the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS)+20 Forum highlights its commitment to the digital economy and digital inclusion, with the forum marking 20 years since the WSIS's initial phases.
3.  India's role in the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) includes its election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF’s Supply Chain Council and participation in the IPEF's Crisis Response Network, but not participation in the IPEF's Labor Rights Advisory Board.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The passage states that India *is* a member of the SCO and that Belarus joined.  However, it also indicates India participated in the G7 summit as an Outreach Country.  While not a full member, participation implies engagement.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text explicitly explains India's participation in the WSIS+20 Forum and its significance in the context of the digital economy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The passage clearly indicates India's involvement in *all three* bodies mentioned within the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement: the Supply Chain Council, the Crisis Response Network, and the Labor Rights Advisory Board.

Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects the information provided.



**1. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. GLOBE Network's primary function is to facilitate international cooperation in combating transnational organized crime, focusing on intelligence sharing and joint investigations.
2. India's election to the steering committee of GLOBE Network signifies its commitment to strengthening global anti-corruption efforts and enhancing international collaborations.
3. The GLOBE Network is an initiative solely spearheaded by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), with no involvement from other intergovernmental organizations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the steering committee of the GLOBE Network underscores its dedication to amplifying global anti-corruption initiatives and fortifying international collaborations in this domain.  This demonstrates India's proactive role in international law enforcement cooperation.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GLOBE Network does indeed focus on combating corruption, its scope extends beyond transnational organized crime.  It encompasses a broader range of anti-corruption activities, including asset recovery, capacity building, and legislative harmonization. The focus is not solely on intelligence sharing and joint investigations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UNODC plays a significant role in the GLOBE Network, it is not the sole driving force.  The network involves a collaborative effort of various anti-corruption law enforcement agencies from different countries, working together to achieve common objectives.  Therefore, the statement oversimplifies the network's governance structure.


**2. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) complete authority over all aspects of personnel management, including promotions and postings, but excludes disciplinary matters.
2. An Inter-Services Organization (ISO) is defined exclusively as a joint services command comprising personnel subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, the Army Act, 1950, and the Navy Act, 1957, thus excluding any other personnel.
3. The Act aims to streamline the command structure of inter-services organizations, enhancing operational efficiency and inter-service coordination in joint military operations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, is designed to improve the command structure of inter-services organizations. This will result in better operational efficiency and enhance inter-service coordination in joint military endeavors.  This is a core objective of the legislation.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Act explicitly grants the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs comprehensive authority over disciplinary and administrative powers over serving or attached personnel. This includes not only personnel management aspects but also disciplinary actions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of an ISO is not as restrictive as stated. While it includes personnel subject to the three service acts, it is not limited to only joint services commands.  The Act's broader scope encompasses a wider range of inter-services bodies.


**3. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS), consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS is directly responsible for the formulation and implementation of all national security policies, bypassing the need for inter-ministerial consultations.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), primarily focuses on short-term tactical assessments and immediate crisis response strategies.
3. The NSCS plays a crucial role in facilitating inter-ministerial coordination on national security issues, ensuring a cohesive and integrated approach to policy formulation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The NSCS is instrumental in fostering collaboration among various ministries on matters of national security. This ensures a unified and comprehensive approach to policy development.  Its role is facilitative, coordinating efforts rather than dictating policy unilaterally.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSCS does not independently formulate and implement all national security policies.  It works in conjunction with other governmental bodies and ministries, playing a coordinating role.  Inter-ministerial consultations remain a crucial aspect of the policy-making process.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB, under the NSA, focuses primarily on long-term strategic analysis and providing policy recommendations to the NSC.  It's concerned with broader, long-term perspectives, not immediate crisis management.


**4. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), consider the following statements:**

1. India's MER assesses its measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes its efforts to combat cybercrime.
2. The FATF MER process involves a peer review conducted by FATF members, ensuring objectivity and transparency in evaluating a country's anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regime.
3. India's first MER was adopted in 2005, reflecting its early engagement with international standards on AML/CFT.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The FATF MER process is indeed a peer review conducted by FATF members. This ensures a degree of objectivity and transparency in evaluating a country's AML/CFT framework. This peer review system is a key element of the FATF's effectiveness.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MER assesses India's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it is an oversimplification to say it *excludes* cybercrime.  The scope of AML/CFT has evolved to include various aspects of financial crime, and the MER likely addresses relevant aspects of cybercrime in the context of financial crimes.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2005.  This is a factual inaccuracy regarding the timeline of India's engagement in the FATF's mutual evaluation process.


**5. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention), consider the following statements:**

1. UNTOC is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, which focuses solely on domestic corruption within signatory nations, excluding transnational aspects.
2. India is not a signatory to UNTOC, relying instead on its domestic legislation to address transnational organized crime.
3. UNTOC provides a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in preventing and combating transnational organized crime, encompassing measures such as mutual legal assistance and extradition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The Palermo Convention (UNTOC) is indeed a comprehensive international treaty establishing a framework for cooperation in combating transnational organized crime.  It covers various aspects, including mutual legal assistance and extradition, to strengthen international collaboration.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While UNTOC is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, the latter does not solely focus on domestic corruption. It addresses both domestic and transnational aspects of corruption, recognizing its cross-border nature.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India *is* a signatory to UNTOC.  This is a crucial point, showing India's commitment to international standards in combating transnational organized crime.  The statement incorrectly asserts that India is not a signatory.


**6. With reference to Cannabis legalization, consider the following statements:**

1.  The legalization of cannabis is primarily driven by the potential for substantial tax revenue generation, outweighing all other considerations.
2.  Uruguay was one of the first countries to fully legalize the recreational use of cannabis, paving the way for other nations to explore similar reforms.
3.  The legalization of cannabis in various jurisdictions has been met with widespread and uniform support across all segments of society, with no significant opposition.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Uruguay did indeed become one of the pioneering nations in fully legalizing recreational cannabis use. This decision has influenced subsequent discussions and policy changes in other countries.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While tax revenue is a factor considered in the legalization debate, it is not the sole or primary driver.  Other factors include public health concerns, social justice issues, and the potential economic benefits beyond tax revenue.  The statement presents an oversimplified and potentially misleading view of the motivations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The legalization of cannabis has been a highly contentious issue, generating significant debate and opposition from various groups.  There is no uniform support across society; concerns remain regarding public health, safety, and potential negative social impacts.  The statement misrepresents the complexity of public opinion surrounding cannabis legalization.


**7. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. The INCB is a subsidiary body of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), operating under its direct supervision and guidance.
2. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB reflects India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts and its active role in global drug policy discussions.
3. The INCB's mandate is limited to monitoring and regulating the production and trade of opium poppies, excluding other controlled substances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB is a clear indication of India's ongoing commitment to international drug control efforts.  His presence on the board enhances India's participation in shaping global drug policy.

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INCB is linked to the UN, it is not a subsidiary body of the UNODC. It operates independently under the UN's overall authority but has its own distinct structure and mandate.  The statement incorrectly describes the INCB's relationship with the UNODC.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The INCB's responsibilities extend beyond opium poppies.  It monitors and regulates a wide range of controlled substances, playing a crucial role in the global effort to combat drug trafficking and abuse.  The statement significantly understates the INCB's scope of work.


**8. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused exclusively on combating cybercrime, neglecting other forms of transnational organized crime.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice by providing them with specialized training in law enforcement techniques.
3. The CCPCJ is a subsidiary organ of the United Nations General Assembly, responsible for promoting international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The CCPCJ is indeed a subsidiary organ of the UN General Assembly, playing a significant role in fostering international cooperation in crime prevention and criminal justice.  Its mandate is broad, covering various aspects of crime control.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The CCPCJ's 33rd session addressed a broader range of issues related to transnational organized crime, not just cybercrime.  The statement misrepresents the scope of the session's agenda.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While GenJust aims to engage youth, its focus is not on specialized law enforcement training.  Instead, it seeks to promote youth participation in crime prevention and criminal justice through broader initiatives, such as awareness campaigns and community engagement programs.  The statement misinterprets the initiative's goals.


**9. With reference to the South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network (SAWEN), consider the following statements:**

1. SAWEN was established in 2005 with the primary goal of combating wildlife trafficking in South Asia by enhancing regional cooperation and intelligence sharing.
2. India is not a member of SAWEN, preferring to address wildlife crime through its own domestic legislation and enforcement mechanisms.
3. SAWEN's activities include capacity building for law enforcement agencies, strengthening legislation, and improving inter-agency coordination in tackling wildlife crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct.  SAWEN's activities indeed encompass capacity building for law enforcement, legislative improvements, and better inter-agency coordination to combat wildlife crime.  These are core elements of its operational framework.

Statement 1 is incorrect. SAWEN was established in 2011, not 2005.  This is a factual error regarding the network's founding year.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India *is* a member of SAWEN.  Its participation reflects India's commitment to regional cooperation in addressing the significant challenge of wildlife trafficking.  The statement wrongly claims India's non-membership.


**10. With reference to the  SAARC Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, 2002, consider the following statements:**

1. All SAARC member states have fully ratified the Convention, ensuring its uniform implementation across the region.
2. The Convention focuses solely on the prevention and suppression of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation, excluding other forms of human trafficking.
3. The Convention establishes mechanisms for regional cooperation, including information sharing and joint investigations, to combat trafficking in women and children.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 3 is correct. The SAARC Convention does establish mechanisms for regional cooperation to combat trafficking, including information sharing and joint investigative efforts.  This collaborative approach is a key aspect of the Convention's framework.

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While many SAARC member states have ratified the Convention, it is not universally ratified across all members.  The statement presents an inaccurate picture of the Convention's implementation status.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Convention's scope extends beyond sexual exploitation.  While sexual exploitation is a major focus, the Convention also addresses other forms of trafficking that exploit women and children.  The statement incorrectly limits the Convention's scope.


**1. With reference to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The CDS heads the Department of Military Affairs (DMA) and functions as its secretary, but does not command any military personnel, including the three Service Chiefs.
2.  The post of CDS was created in 2019, based on recommendations from the K. Subrahmanyam Committee Report submitted in 2001, and holds the rank equivalent to a four-star General.
3. The CDS is the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and holds a crucial advisory role to the Nuclear Command Authority but does not have any direct command over tri-service agencies related to Cyber and Space.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CDS heads the DMA and acts as its secretary, playing a vital role in coordinating the three services. However, a crucial point to note is that the CDS does not exercise any direct military command over the Service Chiefs or individual units.  This crucial distinction prevents potential conflicts and maintains the chain of command within each service branch.

Statement 2 is correct. The CDS post was established in 2019, fulfilling a long-standing recommendation from the K. Subrahmanyam Committee Report, which was submitted much earlier in 2001. The rank of the CDS is equivalent to that of a four-star General, reflecting the high-level strategic role within the Indian military structure.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the CDS is indeed the Permanent Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee and advises the Nuclear Command Authority, the assertion that they lack command over tri-service agencies related to Cyber and Space is inaccurate.  The text clearly states that such agencies fall under the CDS’s command. This reflects the increasing importance of these domains in modern warfare and the need for integrated tri-service capabilities.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 1999 based on recommendations by a task force headed by K.C. Pant and comprises the Ministers of Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB), headed by the National Security Advisor (NSA), is a part of the NSCS and focuses primarily on short-term security threats and immediate policy responses.
3. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG), also headed by the NSA, facilitates inter-ministerial coordination for national security policies, operating under the NSC.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The NSCS was indeed established in 1999 based on the recommendations of the K.C. Pant-led task force. However, the statement incorrectly attributes the composition of the NSC itself to the NSCS. The NSC, the apex advisory body, is headed by the Prime Minister and includes the Ministers of Finance, Defence, Home, and External Affairs.  The NSCS is the secretariat that supports the NSC's functions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSAB, headed by the NSA, provides long-term strategic analysis and policy recommendations to the NSC, not short-term responses.  The focus is on long-term planning and anticipating future threats.

Statement 3 is correct. The SPG, under the NSA, plays a crucial role in coordinating national security policies across different ministries.  This inter-ministerial coordination is vital for effective policy implementation.  Therefore, only statements 1 (partially, corrected above) and 3 are correct.


**3. With reference to the Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023, consider the following statements:**

1. The Act grants the Commander-in-Chief (C-i-C) and Officer-in-Command (O-i-C) of Inter-Services Organizations (ISOs) complete disciplinary and administrative control over all personnel, including those attached temporarily.
2. An ISO is defined as a body comprising troops subject to the Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957, but only if all three Acts apply simultaneously.
3. The Act aims to improve inter-service coordination and streamline decision-making processes for joint operations, including those involving personnel from different services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Act explicitly aims to grant the C-i-C and O-i-C of ISOs comprehensive disciplinary and administrative authority over all personnel under their command, regardless of whether they are permanently assigned or temporarily attached. This centralized authority streamlines command and control.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The definition of an ISO includes bodies of troops subject to any two of the mentioned Acts (Air Force Act, 1950, Army Act, 1950, and Navy Act, 1957), not necessarily all three. This broader definition accommodates the variety of joint operations and organizational structures.

Statement 3 is correct. The Act's underlying goal is to enhance inter-service cooperation and expedite decision-making in joint military operations. By clarifying command structures and responsibilities, the Act seeks to improve efficiency and effectiveness.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 accurately reflect the Act's provisions.


**4.  With reference to the Kargil War and Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Vijay, launched in 1999, aimed to expel Pakistani soldiers and militants who had infiltrated the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, but primarily focused on air power to minimize Indian military casualties.
2. The Kargil War victory is commemorated annually on the anniversary of the conflict's conclusion, celebrating the successful conclusion of Operation Vijay.
3. The primary objective of Operation Vijay was to secure the strategic heights in the Kargil region, which had been occupied by Pakistani forces, thus securing vital Indian infrastructure.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Operation Vijay's goal was indeed to evict Pakistani forces from Kargil, the statement's claim that it primarily relied on air power to minimize Indian casualties is inaccurate.  The operation involved a significant ground offensive, alongside air support.

Statement 2 is correct. The anniversary of the Kargil War victory is celebrated annually, commemorating the successful completion of Operation Vijay and the Indian Army's success in reclaiming the occupied territories.

Statement 3 is correct. Securing the strategic heights in Kargil was a central objective of Operation Vijay.  These heights were crucial for India's national security, and their recapture was a significant achievement.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.




Here are some UPSC-style multiple-choice questions based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (focused on international organizations and events), creating questions that strictly adhere to all instructions (especially the requirement for difficult, fact-based statements with strong distractors) is challenging.  The focus is on testing knowledge of specific details and nuanced understanding, rather than simple recall.


**1. With reference to the Commonwealth of Nations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commonwealth Sub Window, established under the India-UN Development Fund, allocated $75 million over 5 years.
2.  Decisions within the Commonwealth are made through a voting system, where each member holds a weighted vote proportional to its population size.
3.  King Charles III is the Head of State in 16 Commonwealth countries, excluding the United Kingdom.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Commonwealth Sub Window allocated $50 million, not $75 million, over 5 years.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the Commonwealth operates on a consensus-based decision-making process, not a weighted voting system.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; King Charles III is the Head of State in 14 Commonwealth countries (realms), in addition to the UK, not 16.  The question requires precise knowledge of the funding amount and the decision-making process within the Commonwealth, making it a difficult question for those who only have a superficial understanding.


**2. With reference to the India-GCC Joint Ministerial Meeting, consider the following statements:**

1.  The first India-GCC Political Dialogue was held in 2002.
2.  The Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 was adopted at the meeting, outlining a framework for enhanced cooperation in various sectors.
3. The meeting focused primarily on security issues, given the current geopolitical climate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The first India-GCC Political Dialogue took place in 2003, not 2002.  While the Joint Action Plan 2024-2028 was indeed adopted (Statement 2), the source material doesn't specify that security issues were the *primary* focus of the meeting (Statement 3).  Therefore, only Statement 2 is definitively correct. This question tests the ability to differentiate between factual information and inferred interpretations.


**3. With reference to the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1.  The CDS holds the rank of a five-star General.
2.  The CDS directly commands the three service chiefs (Army, Navy, and Air Force).
3.  The Department of Military Affairs (DMA) was created concurrently with the establishment of the CDS post in 2019.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the CDS holds the rank equivalent to a four-star General, not five-star. Statement 2 is incorrect. The CDS is the principal military advisor but does not exercise direct command over the service chiefs. Statement 3 is incorrect; although the DMA was created within the Ministry of Defence, and the CDS functions as its secretary, the text doesn't explicitly state that the DMA was created *concurrently* with the CDS post in 2019.  The creation of the DMA might have occurred slightly earlier or later.  This question highlights the importance of precise wording and understanding the nuances of organizational structures.



**4. With reference to the National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) in India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NSCS was established in 2000 based on the recommendations of the K.C. Pant-led task force.
2. The National Security Advisory Board (NSAB) is responsible for the day-to-day operational management of national security policies.
3. The Strategic Policy Group (SPG) under the NSA facilitates inter-ministerial coordination for national security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the NSC was constituted in 1999, not 2000. Statement 2 is incorrect; the NSAB provides long-term analysis and recommendations, not day-to-day operational management. Statement 3 is correct; the SPG does indeed facilitate inter-ministerial coordination. This question tests the knowledge of the specific roles and responsibilities of different bodies within the NSC structure.  The incorrect options provide plausible distractors based on a general understanding of national security mechanisms.


**5. With reference to the India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, showcasing energy cooperation.
3.  The Protocol on Inland Waterways Trade and Transit (PIWTT) has not been fully operationalized due to ongoing infrastructural challenges.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; While Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, India is the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest. Statement 2 is correct; the Maitree Power Plant exemplifies energy cooperation. Statement 3 is incorrect; the text explicitly mentions the *operationalization* of the PIWTT, implying successful implementation, not ongoing challenges. This question tests the understanding of the specific details of India-Bangladesh economic and energy partnerships, requiring precise knowledge beyond general awareness.



These questions aim for a higher difficulty level by incorporating plausible distractors and requiring detailed knowledge of specific facts and figures.  The explanations provide sufficient context and analysis to justify the correct answers and explain why the other options are incorrect.  Further questions could be generated following the same format and criteria if more text is provided.

Here are some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, following the specified format and criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (geographical locations and historical facts),  creating questions that meet all the stringent criteria for difficulty and plausible distractors while maintaining complete accuracy is challenging.  I've aimed for a high level of difficulty and incorporated plausible but ultimately incorrect distractors where possible.


**1. With reference to Lake Turkana, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is situated in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, making it the largest permanent desert lake globally.
2. The primary water source for Lake Turkana is the Omo River, originating in Ethiopia, contributing significantly to its ecological importance.
3. A recent survey conducted by UNESCO and the World Food Programme (WFP) revealed that Lake Turkana has a low fish potential, impacting the livelihoods of local communities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct. The Omo River is indeed the primary water source for Lake Turkana, and its flow significantly impacts the lake's ecosystem and the communities dependent on it.  Statement 1 is incorrect because while Lake Turkana is the largest *permanent* desert lake, its location is specified as northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia, not northeastern Kenya.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the survey actually revealed *high* fish potential, contradicting the statement's claim of low potential.  The inclusion of seemingly plausible but ultimately false information in statements 1 and 3 increases the question's difficulty and tests the candidate's precise knowledge.


**2. With reference to Mount Kilimanjaro, consider the following statements:**

1. Mount Kilimanjaro, located in Kenya, is the highest peak in Africa and a significant stratovolcano composed of ash, lava, and rock.
2.  Mount Kilimanjaro's unique characteristic lies in its status as the world's largest free-standing mountain, independent of any mountain range.
3. A recent expedition team, under the aegis of the Ministry of Defence, planted the Indian national flag atop the Mawenzi Peak of Mount Kilimanjaro.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 is correct; Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed the world's largest free-standing mountain. Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya, and the expedition planted the flag on Uhuru Peak, not Mawenzi Peak.  Statement 3 is incorrect because the text mentions Uhuru Peak.  These inaccuracies in the distractor statements increase the question's difficulty, requiring the candidate to possess precise knowledge of the mountain's location and the expedition details.


**3. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is situated near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Bhutan, facilitating trade between India and China.
2.  Indian traders are advocating for the reopening of the Lipulekh Pass, closed during the Covid-19 pandemic, to resume border trade with Nepal.
3. The Lipulekh Pass significantly reduces travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, making it a crucial route for religious tourism.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. The Lipulekh Pass does indeed shorten the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage. Statement 1 is incorrect because the tri-junction involves India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan. Statement 2 is incorrect because the trade is with China, not Nepal.  The deliberate misdirection in statements 1 and 2 aims to challenge the candidate's detailed knowledge of the pass's geopolitical context.


**4.  With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1.  India recently shifted a significant portion of its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Panama Canal, impacting global trade dynamics.
2. The Suez Canal, located in Egypt, connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, serving as a crucial maritime link between Asia and Europe.
3. The shift in India's fuel export route has primarily resulted from increased congestion and higher tolls associated with the Suez Canal, prompting a search for alternative routes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 2 correctly describes the Suez Canal's location and function. Statement 1 is inaccurate; the text mentions the Cape of Good Hope, not the Panama Canal, as the alternative route.  Statement 3 presents a plausible but ultimately unsupported reason for the route shift; while congestion and tolls are factors in maritime trade, the text doesn't explicitly state them as the primary cause. The inclusion of these partially true but ultimately incorrect distractors raises the difficulty level, demanding precise recall of the information presented.


**5. With reference to the Chagos Islands, consider the following statements:**

1. The Chagos Islands, located north of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean, are a subject of a sovereignty dispute between the UK and Seychelles.
2. The UK's recent decision to restore sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius has resolved the long-standing territorial dispute in the Indian Ocean region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate.  The strategic location of the Chagos Islands is a key element in the dispute. Statement 1 is incorrect because the dispute is between the UK and Mauritius, not Seychelles. Statement 2 is partially correct in that the UK is restoring sovereignty to Mauritius, but it doesn't fully resolve all aspects of the complex dispute.  The inclusion of partially correct statements increases the difficulty and tests the candidate’s nuanced understanding of the geopolitical situation.


These five MCQs aim to test not only factual recall but also analytical and evaluative skills, aligning with the prompt's requirements for challenging questions with plausible distractors.  Further MCQs could be generated following the same pattern using the remaining information from the provided text.

1. The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund is designed to promote investments and capacity building for Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) within the framework of the Clean Economy Agreement.
2.  The Fair Economy Agreement under IPEF primarily focuses on enhancing resource mobilization through measures such as improved tax transparency and anti-corruption initiatives, while neglecting cross-border investigations.
3. The IPEF Upskilling Initiative, launched in 2022, exclusively targets women and girls in developed economies to provide digital skills training.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund is a key component of the Clean Economy pillar, explicitly aiming to support MSMEs through investment and capacity-building initiatives.  This aligns with the broader goal of promoting clean energy technology development and deployment within the IPEF framework.  The fund's focus on MSMEs is crucial for fostering inclusive growth and participation in global value chains.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Fair Economy Agreement does indeed prioritize anti-corruption measures and improved tax transparency for resource mobilization, it also significantly emphasizes strengthening information sharing, asset recovery, and cross-border investigations to combat illicit financial flows and enhance economic fairness.  These are integral parts of its strategy.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPEF Upskilling Initiative, while focusing on digital skills training, targets women and girls in *emerging* economies, not developed ones.  This initiative recognizes the crucial role of empowering women and bridging the digital divide in developing countries to foster economic growth and inclusivity.  The focus is on capacity building in regions that need it most.


**2. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER), first adopted in 2010, assesses the country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, excluding cybercrime.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is solely responsible for collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to terrorist financing, leaving money laundering to other agencies.
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation by streamlining the process of sharing financial information between India and other countries, but excludes the sharing of intelligence on drug trafficking.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct.  The FATF's MER does indeed assess India's efforts in combating money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a growing concern, it's not explicitly stated as a primary focus within the context of the initial MER.  The 2010 date is also accurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND plays a vital role in collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to *both* money laundering and terrorist financing.  It's not limited to just one area.  Its mandate encompasses a broad range of financial crimes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MLAT portal, while enhancing international cooperation, is not restricted to just financial information.  It aims to facilitate broader legal assistance, potentially including information relevant to various crimes, including drug trafficking, as part of a comprehensive approach to international cooperation in combating crime.


**3. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the initial 2016 agreement primarily involved India, Iran, and Afghanistan, it's improbable that the development of such a significant port would entirely exclude other regional players or potential stakeholders.  The project has broader regional implications and may involve other countries in some capacity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The strategic location of Chabahar Port offers benefits to several countries beyond Afghanistan and India.  It has the potential to significantly impact regional trade and connectivity by providing access to landlocked Central Asian countries, reducing reliance on other, potentially less stable, routes.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The recent 10-year agreement has significant implications beyond just bilateral relations.  It impacts regional trade and connectivity, potentially impacting the economic development of several countries in the region, and influencing geopolitical dynamics.  The agreement carries much wider implications.


**5. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC, established in 2000, is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transportation network connecting India with Russia and Europe, exclusively through Iran and Central Asia, bypassing all other possible routes.
2. The INSTC initiative aims to provide an alternative route to the Suez Canal, primarily focusing on freight transportation and neglecting passenger transport.
3.  The initial agreement for the INSTC was signed solely by India, Iran, and Russia, with no subsequent additions or modifications to the participating countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the INSTC primarily connects India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia, it's unlikely to completely exclude all other possible routes.  The initiative is flexible and might incorporate other routes as needed to optimize efficiency and connectivity.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Although the INSTC primarily focuses on freight transport, it is not impossible that the corridor could facilitate passenger transport in the future as the infrastructure and regulations develop.  The focus might shift as the corridor matures.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The INSTC is a dynamic initiative, and it's highly probable that since its inception in 2000, there have been additions or modifications to the participating countries.  International collaborations of this nature often involve evolving partnerships and expanding participation.

This is a crucial detail, testing the candidate's precise recall of the report's findings.  Statement 2 is correct.  The report indeed highlights the "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent" as regions significantly impacted by drug production and trafficking.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the UNODC does publish a World Wildlife Crime Report, it is not released annually, and the report does address the overlap between wildlife crime and drug trafficking.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IPEF has a broad scope encompassing clean energy, supply chain resilience, and fair trade practices, along with trade liberalization.  The emphasis is not solely on trade liberalization; it's a multifaceted framework. Statement 2 is incorrect. The IPEF's Clean Economy pillar explicitly includes capacity-building initiatives for MSMEs through funds like the IPEF Catalytic Capital Fund.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  While India did sign agreements under the Fair Economy pillar, it was elected as the *Vice-Chair*, not the Chair, of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council. This subtle difference highlights the importance of precise factual recall. The question assesses the candidate's knowledge of the IPEF's structure, pillars, and India's role within the framework.  The incorrect options present plausible but inaccurate details, demanding careful attention to detail for accurate assessment.

This is a key detail that differentiates the correct answer from the incorrect ones. Moreover, India and Nepal are actively involved in various energy projects.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While Arun III and UKHP are indeed significant projects, India and Nepal also have pipeline projects for the transport of natural gas.  Statement 3 is largely correct regarding the hydropower projects, but incorrect about the Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline. This pipeline transports petroleum products, not natural gas. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of regional energy cooperation initiatives, focusing on specific project locations and the types of energy resources involved. The options are carefully crafted to include plausible but factually incorrect details, requiring precise knowledge for a correct response.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India is a significant contributor to UN peacekeeping forces,  it was the *highest* contributor in 2023, not second highest. China's contribution, while substantial, was less than India's that year.  The statement incorrectly places India in second position.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not the Middle East.  While the Middle East has seen numerous peacekeeping operations historically and continues to, the sheer volume of personnel deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa surpassed it in 2023 according to SIPRI data.

Statement 3 is correct.  While the exact figures may vary depending on the specific SIPRI report referenced, the trend towards greater female participation in UN peacekeeping missions is a well-documented development and a key finding often highlighted in their reports. The report likely highlighted a positive increase in 2023 compared to prior years.

**3. With reference to India's participation in multilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exercise Malabar is a quadrilateral naval exercise involving India, the United States, Japan, and Australia.
2.  Exercise RIMPAC is a multilateral naval exercise held biennially and India's participation is limited to observers.
3.  Exercise Khaan Quest is a multinational military exercise hosted by Kazakhstan, and India is a regular participant.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. Exercise Malabar is indeed a quadrilateral naval exercise involving India, the United States, Japan, and Australia. It is a significant event for demonstrating interoperability and cooperation amongst these Indo-Pacific nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is a *participant* in RIMPAC, not merely an observer. It's the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India's active participation reflects its growing engagement in global maritime security.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Exercise Khaan Quest is hosted by *Mongolia*, not Kazakhstan.  It is a multinational exercise focusing on peacekeeping and other aspects of military cooperation, with India being a frequent participant.


**4.  With reference to India's engagement with international organizations, consider the following statements:**

1. India is a member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) but has never undergone a Mutual Evaluation Report (MER).
2. India is a founding member of the International Solar Alliance (ISA) and has played a leading role in its development.
3.  The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights India as a major transit point for narcotics originating in the Golden Crescent region but not a major consumer market.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India *is* a member of the FATF and has undergone Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs).  The MER process is a key part of FATF's work to assess countries' anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regimes.

Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed a founding member of the ISA and has played a crucial role in shaping its agenda and promoting solar energy globally.

Statement 3 is correct. While the UNODC reports may vary year to year,  India's geopolitical location makes it a significant transit route for drugs from the Golden Crescent (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran).  However, the scale of domestic drug consumption within India is a complex issue and might not necessarily be identified as a *major* consumer market compared to others in the UNODC reports, depending on the year and specific metrics used.  The statement doesn't necessarily claim India is *not* a consumer, just not a *major* one.  Therefore, the statement is considered correct in a broad sense.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is a unified tri-service command responsible for the security and administration of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.  This command integrates the Army, Navy, and Air Force under a single operational commander.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Strategic Forces Command (SFC) is responsible for India's *nuclear* weapons stockpile, not conventional military capabilities.  It's a specialized command focused solely on the country's nuclear deterrent.

Statement 3 is correct. The Inter-services Organisations (Command, Control and Discipline) Act, 2023 was indeed enacted to provide clearer command structures and enhance the disciplinary and administrative powers of the Commanders-in-Chief within Inter-Services Organizations. This addresses the organizational complexities and challenges of managing joint operations involving personnel from multiple services.

3. The ARF's primary objective is to facilitate dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues among ASEAN member countries and their partners.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was indeed established in 1994, and India joined in 1996. This marks a significant step in India's engagement with Southeast Asia's regional security architecture.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the ARF does include all ten ASEAN member states and several dialogue partners, the total membership is not 27.  Furthermore, the ARF's focus extends beyond economic cooperation; it primarily addresses political and security issues in the region.  The ARF's structure is built on consensus and dialogue, aiming to foster trust and cooperation among diverse actors.

Statement 3 is correct. The ARF's core objective is to promote dialogue and cooperation on political and security issues. This is crucial for regional stability and conflict prevention in a complex geopolitical environment. The ARF serves as a platform for members to discuss concerns, share perspectives, and build confidence-building measures.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct. Option (b) accurately reflects this.

This initiative seeks to reduce reliance on existing systems and enhance financial connectivity within the bloc.  The use of blockchain promises increased transparency, security, and efficiency in transactions.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BCBPI aims to provide an alternative to SWIFT, it does not aim to completely replace it for all BRICS members by 2025 or any specific timeframe.  The implementation of such a large-scale system is a complex and gradual process, requiring significant technical and regulatory adjustments.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Although Russia and China have been proactive in the BCBPI's development, it's not solely driven by them.  Other BRICS members are involved in its design and implementation, reflecting a collaborative approach to building a robust and inclusive payment system within the BRICS framework.

Therefore, only statement 1 is correct. Option (a) is the accurate answer.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India experiences a trade deficit with ASEAN, meaning its imports from ASEAN exceed its exports to the region. This highlights the need for further efforts to balance trade flows and enhance competitiveness.

Statement 3 is incorrect. AITIGA has, in fact, led to an increase in trade volume between India and ASEAN.  While the trade balance remains a challenge, the agreement has facilitated increased economic interactions.

Only statement 1 is accurate. Therefore, option (a) is the correct answer.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While economic cooperation is a component, IPOI's goals extend beyond purely economic aspects. It aims for a free and open Indo-Pacific based on a rules-based regional order, encompassing security, environmental protection, and sustainable development.


Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  Option (b) is the correct answer.

2. The initiative aims to reduce reliance on existing international payment systems like SWIFT and enhance financial independence among BRICS members.
3. BCBPI utilizes a centralized payment system managed by a single BRICS bank to ensure security and efficiency.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

The BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), or BRICS Pay, is indeed designed to streamline cross-border transactions within the BRICS group. Its primary goal is to offer a faster and more cost-effective alternative to existing systems like SWIFT, thereby reducing reliance on Western-dominated financial infrastructure.  This directly supports the aim of enhancing financial independence and sovereignty among the BRICS nations.  Statement 2 is therefore correct. However, statement 3 is incorrect.  BCBPI leverages blockchain technology, a decentralized system, rather than a centralized one controlled by a single bank. Blockchain's decentralized nature enhances security through distributed ledger technology and reduces single points of failure. The absence of a central authority also increases transparency and reduces the risk of manipulation. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the ARF was indeed established in 1994, India joined in 1996, not as a founding member.  Statement 2 is also incorrect. The ARF's membership extends beyond ASEAN member states and their immediate neighbours to include a broader range of ASEAN Dialogue Partners, reflecting its aim for wider regional engagement on security issues.  Statement 3, however, accurately describes the ARF's core objective: to provide a platform for dialogue and cooperation on political and security matters among ASEAN member states and their partners.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

Although the EAS does discuss economic issues, its scope is broader, encompassing strategic, political, and economic matters.  Statement 3 is correct. The EAS membership comprises all ASEAN member states along with several other Asia-Pacific countries, including the United States, Australia, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Korea and Russia.

While IPOI was launched in 2019, it builds upon India's 'SAGAR' (Security and Growth for All in the Region) initiative, not the 'Act East' policy.  Statement 3 correctly identifies the core focus areas of IPOI, which include collaboration on diverse aspects of maritime cooperation, such as environmental protection and security. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  EFTA is not a customs union; its members maintain their own individual external tariffs.  Statement 2 is also not entirely accurate. While TEPA aims to reduce trade barriers and deepen economic ties, it does not necessarily create a completely free trade area eliminating tariffs on *all* goods.  Statement 3 is correct.

(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The GCI 2024 uses a multi-faceted assessment based on five cybersecurity pillars, not a single criterion. Statement 2 is correct. India was indeed recognized as a role model country in the GCI 2024, signifying a strong commitment to cybersecurity. Statement 3 is incorrect.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes SAARC's decision-making mechanism, which requires unanimous agreement among its members. Statement 2 is partially correct. The SAARC Currency Swap Framework aims to provide liquidity support to member states during times of financial need, but it's not solely focused on bilateral exchanges. It's more about regional financial stability. Statement 3 is incorrect. SAARC's operational effectiveness has been significantly hampered in recent years, with reduced cooperation among member states.  Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Belarus's membership does signal a geographical expansion for the SCO, but it's not solely focused on Eastern Europe. The SCO's focus is broader than just Eastern Europe. Statement 2 is incorrect. While the SCO addresses economic issues, its focus is much broader, encompassing security, counter-terrorism, and cultural exchanges. Statement 3 is correct. The SCO's decision-making process relies on consensus, requiring unanimous agreement among its members. Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely accurate.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because while the CWC does mandate the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles, the timeframe isn't necessarily "irrespective of their production date."  The destruction process is complex and timelines are negotiated based on factors like the quantity and type of weapons.  Moreover, the CWC includes robust verification measures, including on-site inspections.  Statement 2 is entirely false.  The CWC's verification regime is a key component of the treaty, involving inspections and declarations.  Statement 3 is correct; these four countries remain outside the CWC's framework.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The question tests factual knowledge of the CWC and its implementation, highlighting potential misconceptions regarding the treaty's verification mechanisms and the timeline for weapons destruction.


**2. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India, first adopted in 2010, assesses the country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes cybercrime.
2. India's counter-money laundering measures include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, alongside the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-IND) in 2004.
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating financial crimes, but excludes cooperation with countries not members of the FATF.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While the MER does assess money laundering, terrorist financing, and WMD proliferation, it's not explicitly stated (nor implied in the given text) that it *excludes* cybercrime. The provided text focuses on the three primary areas. Statement 2 is completely correct. It accurately reflects India's legislative and institutional frameworks for combating money laundering.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The text does not state that the MLAT portal excludes cooperation with non-FATF members.  The focus of the statement is on international cooperation, and there's no basis to assume it excludes any country.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are partially or fully correct. The question tests knowledge of the FATF's activities and India's specific responses to financial crimes, including the potential misconception that the MLAT portal has restrictions on its partnerships.


**3. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's 2024 World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with the highest prevalence in the "Golden Triangle" region.
2.  The UNODC report highlights the "Triple Frontier Area" (Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay) and the "Golden Crescent" (Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran) as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking and abuse, but downplays the role of the "Golden Triangle."
3.  The report indicates that cannabis legalization is limited to Canada and Uruguay, with no US jurisdictions having legalized cannabis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While cannabis is identified as the most abused drug, the report highlights multiple regions of concern, not just the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle"). Statement 2 is also incorrect. The report highlights *both* the "Triple Frontier Area" and the "Golden Crescent" (now "Death Crescent") as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking. The text doesn't indicate downplaying the role of the "Death Triangle." Statement 3 is also incorrect; the report clearly states that cannabis is legalized in 27 US jurisdictions, in addition to Canada and Uruguay. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely accurate. The question tests knowledge of the UNODC's drug reports, highlighting potential misconceptions about the regions most impacted by drug abuse and the extent of cannabis legalization globally.  It also checks for precise recall of the names and locations.

2. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in armed conflict, but does not address their production or stockpiling.
3. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) is a universally ratified treaty, with all nations participating in its implementation and verification processes.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

While anti-piracy is a key component of CMF operations, the force's mandate encompasses a broader range of maritime security tasks, including counter-terrorism, drug interdiction, and other threats to maritime stability.  The Indian Navy's participation contributes to these diverse operations.

Statement 3 is correct. Operation Crimson Barracuda did indeed result in the seizure of a significant quantity of drugs in the Arabian Sea. This highlights the CMF's effectiveness in combating illicit activities in international waters and India's active role in these efforts.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**4. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA has been recently revoked from all areas of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.
2. The AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces to maintain public order in designated areas, even overriding certain fundamental rights.
3. The extension of AFSPA requires parliamentary approval.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The provided text states that AFSPA has been *extended* to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh, not revoked. This indicates a continuation, not a cessation, of its application in these regions.

Statement 2 is correct.  The AFSPA does grant special powers to the armed forces, enabling them to maintain public order in designated disturbed areas. This includes powers that might override certain fundamental rights, a point of significant contention and debate.

Statement 3 is correct.  The extension of AFSPA to any area requires parliamentary approval, highlighting the legislative oversight involved in the application of this controversial act.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are accurate.  The question plays on the nuance of the word "revoked" versus "extended".



**5. With reference to the Kargil War and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar was a naval operation conducted by the Indian Navy to blockade Pakistan's navy.
2. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was chaired by A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.
3. The Kargil War primarily involved combat in the Siachen Glacier region.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an air operation conducted by the Indian Air Force, not a naval operation.  The statement incorrectly attributes it to the Navy.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Kargil Review Committee (KRC) was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam, not A.P.J. Abdul Kalam.  This involves confusing two prominent figures in Indian defense and science.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While high altitude warfare was a significant feature, the Kargil War primarily involved combat in the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir, not exclusively the Siachen Glacier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1967 Outer Space Treaty aims to prevent an arms race in space, it doesn't explicitly prohibit *all* types of weapons.  The treaty focuses primarily on weapons of mass destruction (WMDs).  The wording is crucial here.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNSC resolution vetoed by Russia specifically targeted WMDs and nuclear weapons, not all types of space-based weaponry. This highlights the complexities and nuances of international space law and the differing interpretations of existing treaties.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Militarization of space has a broader meaning than just weapon deployment. It also includes the use of space for supporting ground, sea, and air-based military operations, even without deploying weapons in space itself.  This is a key distinction often missed. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Strengthening the Quad Act" aims to *strengthen*, not weaken, cooperation among the Quad nations (US, Australia, India, and Japan). The statement misrepresents the intent of the act.

Statement 2 is correct. The Quad Leaders' Summit in Wilmington did indeed adopt the "Wilmington Declaration," which outlined various key partnerships and initiatives.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership specifically focuses on combating *cervical* cancer, not breast cancer.  The statement contains a factual error regarding the type of cancer targeted. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating TOC was a key focus, the 33rd session of the CCPCJ addressed a broader range of criminal justice issues, not solely cybercrime.  The statement oversimplifies the session's agenda.

Statement 2 is correct. The "Generation Justice (GenJust)" initiative is specifically designed to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice efforts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India *is* a signatory and a party to the UNTOC, demonstrating its commitment to international cooperation in combating transnational organized crime.  Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating corruption encompasses money laundering, GlobE's mandate is broader, addressing various forms of corruption and related crimes.  The statement is too narrow in scope.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election to the GlobE steering committee does highlight its commitment to international anti-corruption efforts and cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. GlobE is a global network, not limited to law enforcement agencies from G20 nations.  The statement incorrectly restricts the network's membership. Therefore, only statement 2 is accurate.

(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER also assesses a country's measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to money laundering and terrorist financing.  The statement omits a key aspect of the MER's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2000.  This is a chronological error.

Statement 3 is correct. The FIU-IND is indeed a crucial institution in India's efforts to combat money laundering and related financial crimes. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the *most* abused drug globally, not the least.  This is a direct contradiction of the report's findings.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 has a global scope, not limited to Africa.  The statement incorrectly restricts the report's geographical focus.

Statement 3 is correct. The "Golden Triangle" region, notorious for drug production, does include Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand and is now often referred to as the "Death Triangle". Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IBSAMAR VIII involves only India, Brazil, and South Africa; the US is not a participant.  The statement adds an extra participant country.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Pitch Black is held every *two* years, not four.  This is a simple numerical error concerning the exercise's frequency.

2. The Mindanao conflict involves a struggle for autonomy and Islamic governance, pitting the Philippine government against the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
3. The Tigray conflict in Ethiopia is characterized by a political power struggle and demands for autonomy, with the Ethiopian government confronting the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect the core issues driving the respective conflicts.  Statement 1 correctly identifies the key drivers of the West Papuan conflict: the Indonesian government's exploitation of resources and suppression of Papuan culture fueling the OPM's independence movement.  Statement 2 accurately describes the Mindanao conflict's central issues: the MILF's pursuit of greater autonomy and the establishment of Islamic governance, countered by the Philippine government. Finally, Statement 3 correctly pinpoints the core of the Tigray conflict – a power struggle between the Ethiopian government and the TPLF, further complicated by Tigrayan demands for greater autonomy.  Therefore, all three statements provide accurate and concise summaries of these complex geopolitical situations.

(a) 2 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the IAEA's ITDB explicitly includes incidents of nuclear material theft, not just trafficking.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the ITU's GCI 2024 assessment and India's classification as a "role-modeling" country. Statement 3 correctly describes Operation Crimson Barracuda as India's first such operation under the CMF following its 2022 membership.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  The inclusion of theft within the ITDB's scope renders statement 1 inaccurate, highlighting the importance of precise understanding of organizational mandates.


**3. With reference to geopolitical hotspots and conflicts, consider the following statements:**

1. The Nagorno-Karabakh region, known as Artsakh by Armenians, is officially recognized as part of Azerbaijan, and the recent withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers follows Azerbaijan's recapture of disputed territory.

3. The Nord Stream pipelines, damaged by explosions, supplied natural gas from Russia to northern Germany, and a recent study suggests thousands of tonnes of methane may have dissolved in the Baltic Sea as a result.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements correctly describe aspects of the geopolitical situations mentioned. Statement 1 accurately reflects the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, its contested nature, and the implications of the Russian peacekeeping withdrawal. Statement 2 correctly identifies Snake Island's location and its strategic importance within the broader context of the Ukraine conflict, even if not explicitly mentioning shipping lanes. Statement 3 correctly describes the Nord Stream pipelines, their function, the impact of the explosions, and the subsequent methane leak into the Baltic Sea.  Therefore, all three statements are factually accurate, showcasing a solid understanding of relevant geopolitical events.

2. The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), adopted in 1992 and in force since 1997, includes detailed verification measures to ensure compliance, and India is a signatory and party, having enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000.
3.  The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development and use of biological weapons, while the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention bans the production and stockpiling of chemical weapons, but not necessarily their use in all contexts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Geneva Protocol prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare but doesn’t ban their development, production, or stockpiling.  Statement 2 is correct in its description of the CWC and India's involvement.  Statement 3 is also largely correct; while the 1993 CWC aims to eliminate chemical weapons comprehensively,  the nuances of its application and interpretation might allow for exceptions under certain circumstances (although the treaty's overall goal is complete prohibition).  Thus, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate representations of the conventions described.  The inaccuracy of statement 1 highlights the importance of precise understanding of international law.


**5. With reference to India's relations with its neighbors, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's second-largest trading partner in Asia; both countries engage in joint military exercises such as SAMPRITI and MILAN.
2.  The India-Maldives relationship has seen initiatives like Operation Neer (providing water during a crisis) and Vaccine Maitri (supplying vaccines during the COVID-19 pandemic), but also faced challenges due to the Maldives' pro-China stance under previous administrations.
3.  India's engagement with Bhutan includes hydropower projects like Kurichu, Tala, Chukha, and Mangdechhu, along with cross-border energy cooperation initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 1 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of India's relationships with its neighbors. Statement 1 correctly highlights the significant trade relationship between India and Bangladesh and the presence of joint military exercises. Statement 2 accurately describes the multifaceted nature of India-Maldives relations, including both cooperative efforts and challenges arising from the Maldives' shifting geopolitical alignments. Statement 3 correctly points to the substantial energy cooperation between India and Bhutan, exemplified by the mentioned hydropower projects.  Therefore, all three statements provide a balanced and accurate overview of India's regional partnerships.  The inclusion of both cooperative and challenging aspects in statements 2 highlights the complexity of regional diplomacy.


**1. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC, adopted in 1992 and in force since 1997, mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles within a predetermined timeframe, regardless of the signatory nation's geopolitical standing.
2.  The CWC's verification mechanisms solely rely on self-reporting by member states, with no provision for on-site inspections of chemical facilities or research programs.
3.  Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan are the only four countries that have not ratified the CWC, highlighting a significant gap in global chemical weapons control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The CWC does mandate the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles within a specified timeframe. However, the timeframe and specific requirements may vary slightly based on a nation's capabilities and circumstances.  The core principle of complete destruction remains, but the implementation details are nuanced.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The CWC has a robust verification regime that includes on-site inspections of declared and undeclared chemical weapons facilities, stockpiles, and research programs.  This is a crucial aspect of ensuring compliance and preventing the proliferation of chemical weapons.  The system isn't solely dependent on self-reporting.

Statement 3 is correct.  Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan are indeed the only four countries that are not parties to the CWC as of the information provided. This omission significantly undermines the treaty's global reach and effectiveness in preventing the use and proliferation of chemical weapons.


**2. With reference to India's measures to combat money laundering, consider the following statements:**

1. The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, are the primary legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, respectively, with no overlap in their jurisdictions.
2. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, and the Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, are the two key institutions responsible for investigating and prosecuting money laundering cases in India, with the FIU-IND focusing solely on intelligence gathering.
3. India's Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating money laundering but is limited to information sharing only, excluding any provisions for joint investigations or prosecutions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While PMLA and UAPA are crucial, they do have some overlap in their application, particularly in cases where money laundering is linked to terrorist activities.  The statement incorrectly implies complete separation of jurisdictions.

Statement 2 is partially correct.  The FIU-IND is primarily responsible for intelligence gathering, but the ED plays a larger role in investigations and prosecutions. The statement oversimplifies the roles of these two agencies.  It also incorrectly states that FIU-IND focuses solely on intelligence gathering.  

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The MLAT portal is designed to facilitate broader international cooperation, including joint investigations and prosecutions, not just information sharing.  The statement understates the scope and functionality of the portal.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations with Maldives, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" between India and Maldives focuses solely on economic cooperation, excluding any aspects of maritime security or defense collaborations.
2.  India's RuPay card launch in the Maldives and the Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) are primarily aimed at boosting tourism revenue for the Maldives and strengthening the Indian Rupee against the Maldivian Rufiyaa.
3.  India's initiatives to strengthen relations with the Maldives include the construction of a new Coast Guard base at Uthuru Thilafalhu (UTF) atoll, but exclude any grant aid for community development projects.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership" explicitly includes both economic and maritime security aspects, reflecting a broader strategic partnership.  The statement misrepresents the partnership's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While the RuPay card and CSA aim to enhance financial linkages, the primary goals are to improve financial access and stability for the Maldives, not specifically to boost tourism revenue or manipulate exchange rates.  The statement incorrectly frames the objectives.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  India's aid to the Maldives includes both infrastructure projects like the Coast Guard base and grant aid for High Impact Community Development Projects (HICDPs). The statement omits a key aspect of India's engagement.


**4. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) programs, consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively focuses on incidents of nuclear material theft, excluding any monitoring or reporting of illicit nuclear trafficking.
2.  The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to enhance global food security by solely focusing on crop improvement and not considering any other aspects of food production.
3. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes nuclear energy to achieve net-zero emissions, but does not address the challenges or concerns related to nuclear waste management.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) None
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB explicitly covers both incidents of theft and trafficking of nuclear materials.  The statement incorrectly restricts the database's scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Atoms4Food utilizes nuclear techniques across a wide spectrum of food production, not just crop improvement. This includes areas such as animal husbandry, pest control, and food processing. The statement severely limits the program's activities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Atoms4NetZero promotes nuclear energy, the IAEA also acknowledges and addresses the challenges of nuclear waste management as an integral part of the sustainable use of nuclear energy.  The statement ignores a critical aspect of the initiative.


**5. With reference to India-Bhutan relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation between India and Bhutan, renewed in 2007, grants India complete control over Bhutan's foreign policy and defense matters.
2.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, with a significant trade surplus in Bhutan's favor, and the leading source of foreign direct investment in Bhutan.
3.  The India-Bhutan SAT (Satellite) project is a joint venture aimed at enhancing telecommunications infrastructure in Bhutan, with India providing all the technological expertise and funding.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the treaty establishes a close relationship, it does not grant India complete control over Bhutan's foreign policy and defense. Bhutan maintains its sovereignty and independent decision-making.  The statement misrepresents the nature of the treaty.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, but the balance of trade is significantly in India's favor, not Bhutan's.  Also, while India is a leading investor, the statement overstates its role.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While it is a joint venture, the statement oversimplifies the collaboration.  Both countries contribute technologically and financially to the project.  The statement inaccurately portrays the nature of the partnership.



**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Golden Crescent and Golden Triangle regions:**

1. The Golden Crescent, now often referred to as the Death Crescent, primarily encompasses Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, known for significant opium production.
2. The Golden Triangle, now sometimes called the Death Triangle, consists of Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, also notorious for illicit drug cultivation.
3.  Cannabis legalization has been implemented in a majority of US states, mirroring similar legislation in Canada and Uruguay.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect the geographical composition and historical significance of the Golden Crescent and Golden Triangle as major regions for opium and other illicit drug production.  The renaming of these regions to "Death Crescent" and "Death Triangle" reflects the devastating impact of the drug trade on these areas.  Statement 3 is partially correct in that cannabis legalization has occurred in Canada and Uruguay and in several US jurisdictions, but it's inaccurate to state it's a *majority* of US states.  While a significant number of US states have legalized cannabis for medicinal or recreational purposes,  a majority have not. This makes option (a) the only entirely correct choice. The other options include statement 3, which is partially incorrect, making them unsuitable as the correct answer.


**2. With reference to the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB), consider the following statements:**

1. Jagjit Pavadia's re-election to the INCB signifies India's continuous commitment to international drug control efforts.
2.  The INCB's primary function is to monitor and regulate the global trade in legal pharmaceuticals.
3. The INCB's mandate includes assessing the implementation of international drug control treaties and conventions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct as Jagjit Pavadia's re-election highlights India's continued involvement in international drug control.  Statement 3 correctly identifies a key role of the INCB—monitoring treaty implementation to combat illicit drug production and trafficking.  Statement 2 is incorrect. While the INCB is concerned with the legitimate trade in controlled substances to prevent diversion for illicit purposes, its primary focus is not the regulation of legal pharmaceuticals. The INCB's main concern is the illicit trafficking and abuse of drugs. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the appropriate answer.


**3. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1.  The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative aims to involve young people in crime prevention strategies.
2. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused solely on addressing cybercrime and data breaches.
3.  The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC) is a key mechanism in tackling transnational organized crime, and India is a signatory.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the GenJust initiative's goal of engaging youth in crime prevention.  Statement 3 correctly points out UNTOC's importance and India's participation. Statement 2 is incorrect; while the 33rd session addressed transnational organized crime, it didn't focus *solely* on cybercrime. The session had a broader scope encompassing various aspects of transnational organized crime. Options (b), (c), and (d) are therefore incorrect because they either include the false statement 2 or exclude the true statements 1 and 3.


**4. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GLOBE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1. India's election to the GLOBE Network's steering committee strengthens its role in international anti-corruption efforts.
2. The GLOBE Network primarily focuses on combating money laundering through international financial regulations.
3. The GLOBE Network's activities are solely confined to sharing intelligence and conducting joint investigations within the G20 framework.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly reflects the significance of India's participation in the GLOBE Network's steering committee. Statements 2 and 3 are incorrect. While combating money laundering is a part of the GLOBE Network's broader mandate, it doesn't focus *primarily* on it through international financial regulations alone. The network's scope extends beyond just money laundering and intelligence sharing within the G20.  The GLOBE Network operates internationally, not being limited to the G20 framework. Therefore, only statement 1 is entirely accurate.


**5. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1.  The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's efforts to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, demonstrating a long-standing commitment to anti-money laundering measures.
3. The FATF primarily operates by imposing direct sanctions on non-compliant countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the purpose and timeline of India's MER within the FATF framework. Statement 3 is incorrect. The FATF doesn't directly impose sanctions; its primary mechanism is peer review and the publication of reports that highlight compliance issues.  These reports can then influence other international bodies or individual countries to take action.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**6. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug globally.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade in Africa.
3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects a key finding from the UNODC's World Drug Day report. Statement 3 correctly identifies the UNODC's role as the secretariat for UNTOC. Statement 2 is incorrect; the UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, not limited to Africa. Therefore, options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect as they either include the false statement 2 or exclude the true statements 1 and 3.


**7.  Consider the following statements regarding the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA):**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors illicit nuclear material trafficking globally.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food initiative solely focuses on improving crop yields in developing nations.

1. The Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) assesses countries' commitment to cybersecurity.
2.  India is categorized as a "role-modeling" country in the GCI 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity.
3. The ITU's primary focus is on regulating international air travel and communication systems.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately describe the GCI and India's position within it. Statement 3 is incorrect; the ITU's focus is on telecommunications, not air travel.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**9. With reference to the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Indian Navy's participation in Operation Crimson Barracuda demonstrates its commitment to international counter-narcotics efforts.
2. CMF operations are exclusively focused on combating piracy in the Indian Ocean region.
3. India joined the CMF in 2022, signifying its growing involvement in multinational maritime security collaborations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly highlights India's involvement in Operation Crimson Barracuda as part of its contribution to international efforts against drug trafficking. Statement 3 accurately notes India's 2022 entry into the CMF. Statement 2 is incorrect; CMF operations encompass a broader range of maritime security issues, not just piracy. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 are correct.


**10. Consider the following statements regarding the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA):**

1. AFSPA has been extended to certain parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.
2. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces, including the power to arrest without a warrant.
3. AFSPA has been repealed in all states of India where it was previously in effect.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly states the extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. Statement 2 accurately describes some of the special powers granted under AFSPA. Statement 3 is incorrect; AFSPA remains in effect in certain areas of India. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are correct.


**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1.  The PGII was launched in 2021 with the aim of mobilizing $500 billion by 2025 for infrastructure projects in developing countries.
2.  The initiative prioritizes sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development, focusing primarily on renewable energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa.
3.  The PGII is a collaborative effort involving the G7 nations, the World Bank, and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: the PGII was launched in 2022, not 2021, and it aims to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not $500 billion by 2025. Statement 2 is partially correct in its emphasis on sustainable and high-quality infrastructure, but it incorrectly limits the focus to renewable energy projects in Sub-Saharan Africa. The PGII's scope is broader, encompassing various infrastructure sectors across developing nations. Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the G7 is a key driver of the PGII,  the World Bank and AIIB are not explicitly named as core partners in the initiative's foundational structure. The PGII’s funding mechanisms involve a complex interplay of public and private sector investment, with multiple international and national actors involved.  The question highlights the need for precise recall of details surrounding the PGII’s launch date, funding target, and the precise nature of its partnerships.  The distractors are plausible because they incorporate elements of truth while altering key details, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between factual accuracy and close approximations.


**2. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral terrorism list reflects its historical commitment to supporting communist regimes irrespective of their human rights records.
2.  The US's unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism' is based solely on objective assessments of a country's involvement in international terrorist activities, devoid of any political considerations.
3.  In addition to Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and Syria, Venezuela is also currently included on the US's unilateral list of State Sponsors of Terrorism.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 presents an oversimplified and biased view of NAM's motivations. While NAM has historically included countries with varying political systems, its position on Cuba's inclusion on the US terrorism list is primarily driven by a principled opposition to unilateral sanctions and a desire to protect the sovereignty of its member states. The statement misrepresents NAM's nuanced approach to international relations by focusing on a single aspect and applying a potentially unfair generalization.  Statement 2 is false because the US's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism is often criticized for being politically motivated and lacking transparency. The inclusion and exclusion of countries on this list are often influenced by geopolitical considerations and bilateral relations rather than purely objective assessments. Statement 3 is incorrect; while North Korea, Iran, and Syria are on the list, Venezuela is not currently included. This statement tests the candidate’s knowledge of current geopolitical events and the specifics of the US's State Sponsors of Terrorism list. The distractors are designed to exploit potential biases or incomplete knowledge about NAM's foreign policy and the complexities of international terrorism designation.


**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is the largest among all member states.
2.  The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) was last hosted by India in 2003.
3.  The Commonwealth Sub-Window, established under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund, has a total allocation of $40 million over 5 years.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is wrong; while India is a significant contributor, it is not the largest contributor to the Commonwealth's budget. Several other countries, including the UK and Canada, contribute larger sums. The statement tests the candidate's understanding of the financial dynamics within the Commonwealth. Statement 2 is incorrect. India last hosted the CHOGM in 1983, not 2003. The incorrect year serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of historical events.  Statement 3 is also incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Partnership Fund has a total allocation of $50 million, not $40 million, over 5 years. This error tests the candidate’s attention to detail and ability to recall specific financial figures. The incorrect figures and dates in the statements are carefully chosen distractors, designed to test the candidate's ability to critically evaluate information and avoid making assumptions.


**4. With reference to the UN Global Supply Chain Forum (UN-GSCF), consider the following statements:**

1. The UN-GSCF's inaugural edition was hosted jointly by the UNCTAD and the government of Singapore.
2.  The UN-GSCF primarily focuses on mitigating supply chain disruptions caused by climate change and geopolitical tensions, with a secondary focus on technological advancements in logistics.
3. The UN-GSCF launched a manifesto advocating for efficient and resilient freight transport, emphasizing the use of electric vehicles to meet global climate targets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)


**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. Statement 1 incorrectly states the location of the inaugural UN-GSCF.  It was hosted by the UN Trade and Development and the Government of Barbados, not Singapore. This tests the candidate's knowledge of specific geographical locations and international collaborations. Statement 2 is partially correct in recognizing the primary focus on mitigating supply chain disruptions, but it downplays the forum's broad scope. The UN-GSCF addresses a wide range of factors affecting global supply chains, not just climate change and geopolitical tensions, and technological advancements are a central, not secondary, concern. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the UN-GSCF did launch a manifesto for efficient and resilient freight transport, it did not specifically emphasize electric vehicles.  The manifesto focuses on intermodal, low-carbon transport and logistics more broadly.  The incorrect details in the options serve as effective distractors, testing the candidate's understanding of the UN-GSCF's objectives and outcomes. The question necessitates a precise understanding of the UN-GSCF's location, priorities, and specific policy outcomes.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade and investment between India, the Middle East, and Europe by developing new sea routes.
2.  The IMEC initiative was formally launched during the 2023 G20 Summit in New Delhi.
3.  The IMEC aims to improve connectivity by developing digital infrastructure alongside physical infrastructure projects.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is accurate. The IMEC aims to improve connectivity, and this includes both physical infrastructure projects and digital infrastructure development.  Statement 1 is partially correct in that the IMEC aims to enhance trade and investment but is inaccurate in its assertion that it focuses on developing *new* sea routes.  The corridor will likely utilize existing sea routes and aim to improve their efficiency and reduce bottlenecks.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while the IMEC's importance is frequently discussed at high levels, its formal launch is not specifically tied to the 2023 G20 Summit in New Delhi. The corridor is a developing concept whose formal launch date might not be explicitly defined.  The question tests the candidate's ability to differentiate between the core objectives of the IMEC and peripheral details about its launch and implementation strategy. The distractors test the candidate's knowledge of the IMEC's scope and its relationship with other international initiatives.  The candidate must accurately recall the IMEC's stated goals, avoiding assumptions based on the general context of regional economic corridors.


**6. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's 2024 summit was held in Samarkand, Uzbekistan.
2.  At the 2024 summit,  the SCO adopted a new anti-drug strategy covering the period 2025-2030.
3.  Belarus's accession to the SCO was finalized at the 2024 summit, making it the tenth member state.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely accurate. Belarus's membership in the SCO was confirmed at the 2024 summit. Statement 1 is incorrect; the 2024 summit was held in Astana, Kazakhstan, not Samarkand, Uzbekistan. This tests the candidate's ability to recall precise geographical locations and details of international events. Statement 2 is also incorrect; while a new anti-drug strategy was adopted, the timeframe is 2024-2029, not 2025-2030.  This tests the candidate's attention to detail regarding the specific timeframes of SCO initiatives.  The question tests the candidate’s ability to recall specific details about recent SCO summits, including the location, key decisions, and membership changes. The distractors use plausible but incorrect dates and locations to create a challenging question for the candidate.


**7.  With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 summit in 2024 was held in Berlin, Germany.
2.  The G7's "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative focuses solely on solar energy projects.
3.  The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) primarily addresses issues related to marine pollution and biodiversity loss.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; the 2024 G7 summit was held in Apulia, Italy, not Berlin, Germany.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of recent G7 summit locations. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative has a broader scope than just solar energy projects. It aims to facilitate access to external investment for various clean energy projects across Africa.  Statement 3 is inaccurate; while marine pollution and biodiversity loss are addressed, the FSOI has a broader focus encompassing sustainable ocean management, maritime security, and sustainable fisheries. The question tests the candidate's recall of specific G7 initiatives and their detailed objectives, requiring precise knowledge of the location of the summit, the scope of the energy initiative, and the FSOI's focus areas. The distractors incorporate elements of truth while misrepresenting the overall scope and focus of the G7 initiatives.


**8. With reference to the BRICS, consider the following statements:**

1. The New Development Bank (NDB) is headquartered in New Delhi, India.
2.  The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement primarily aims to provide long-term financial assistance to member nations facing economic crises.
3.  The BRICS Grain Exchange is designed to facilitate direct trade between farmers and consumers, eliminating intermediaries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; the NDB's headquarters is located in Shanghai, China, not New Delhi, India. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the location of significant international financial institutions. Statement 2 is also incorrect. The BRICS Contingent Reserve Arrangement provides *short-term* liquidity support, not long-term financial assistance, to member nations experiencing balance-of-payments difficulties.  This tests the understanding of the nature and purpose of the CRA. Statement 3 is inaccurate; the BRICS Grain Exchange aims to create a fairer trading system for agricultural products within the BRICS community but does not necessarily eliminate intermediaries. This tests the candidate's understanding of the mechanisms used by the BRICS Grain Exchange. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational details and operational mechanisms of key BRICS institutions. The distractors are designed to exploit potential misconceptions about the location of the NDB, the purpose of the CRA, and the operational structure of the Grain Exchange.


**9. With reference to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), consider the following statements:**

1.  India became a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN in 1992.
2.  The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) includes all members of ASEAN plus 17 ASEAN Dialogue Partners.
3. The ASEAN Future Forum was proposed by Indonesia at the 43rd ASEAN Summit.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; India became a Dialogue Partner of ASEAN in 1996, not 1992.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the chronology of India's engagement with ASEAN. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the ARF includes 10 ASEAN member states and 10 ASEAN Dialogue Partners, not 17. This tests the candidate's knowledge of the membership of the ARF. Statement 3 is false; the ASEAN Future Forum was proposed by Vietnam, not Indonesia, at the 43rd ASEAN Summit. This tests the candidate’s ability to recall the origin of specific ASEAN initiatives. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of the timeline of India-ASEAN relations, the membership structure of the ARF, and the origin of the ASEAN Future Forum. The distractors offer plausible but inaccurate dates, figures, and attributions, making it challenging to determine the correct answer without precise factual knowledge.


**10. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) was established in 2005.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program primarily focuses on using nuclear technology for improving crop yields in developed countries.
3. The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program uses nuclear techniques for disease surveillance and control.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. The IAEA's Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program does utilize nuclear techniques for disease surveillance and control.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the ITDB was established in 1995, not 2005.  This tests the candidate's knowledge of the IAEA's historical initiatives. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the Atoms4Food program focuses on improving food security globally, with a significant emphasis on developing countries, not just developed ones.  The question tests the candidate's understanding of the IAEA's various programs and their specific applications. The distractors involve incorrect dates and misrepresentations of the program's geographical focus.  The question requires precise knowledge of the IAEA's programs and their objectives.


**1. With reference to international treaties related to weapons, consider the following statements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention mandates the complete destruction of existing biological weapon stockpiles within a specified timeframe.
2. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention includes provisions for on-site inspections of declared chemical weapons facilities to ensure compliance.
3. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) explicitly defines and criminalizes the development, production, and use of chemical weapons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons, it doesn't explicitly mandate the destruction of existing stockpiles within a specified timeframe.  The treaty focuses on prevention and prohibition, leaving the specifics of stockpile destruction to national implementation and subsequent protocols.

Statement 2 is correct. A key feature of the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention is its robust verification mechanism. This includes detailed provisions for on-site inspections of declared chemical weapons facilities, production sites, and research programs to ensure compliance with the treaty's stipulations.  This verification process is crucial for building confidence among states and deterring non-compliance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishes the ICC to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  While the use of chemical weapons could fall under the definition of war crimes, the Rome Statute itself doesn't specifically define or criminalize the development, production, and use of chemical weapons.  This is the purview of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  The ICC's jurisdiction is based on the crimes committed, not necessarily the specific weapons used.


**2. With reference to international organizations and their activities, consider the following statements:**

1. The Universal Postal Union (UPU), a specialized agency of the United Nations, is celebrating its 200th anniversary in 2024.
2. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) has been tasked by the Union Finance Minister of India to focus primarily on providing financial assistance to high-income countries.
3. The OPEC+ group, comprising OPEC members and other major oil-producing nations, recently extended its deep oil output cuts into 2025.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is celebrating its 150th anniversary, not its 200th anniversary, in 2024.  This is a significant milestone for the organization, highlighting its long history in facilitating international postal services.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Union Finance Minister of India has requested the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) to assist low-income countries, not high-income countries, in accessing financial resources for infrastructure development. This reflects India's commitment to supporting the development of less developed nations.

Statement 3 is correct. OPEC+ (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries plus other major oil producers) did indeed agree to extend its significant oil production cuts into 2025.  This decision has important implications for global oil prices and energy markets.


**3. With reference to the Bay of Bengal Initiative for Multi-Sectoral Technical and Economic Cooperation (BIMSTEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  BIMSTEC's charter, adopted at the 4th BIMSTEC summit in 2021, outlines principles of sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and peaceful coexistence.
2. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity focuses primarily on developing air transport links between member states.
3.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2024 marked the completion of the ratification process by all member states, bringing the Charter into force.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The BIMSTEC charter was adopted at the 5th BIMSTEC summit, not the 4th,  in Sri Lanka in 2022. The principles mentioned—sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and peaceful coexistence—are indeed core tenets of the Charter.  The slight inaccuracy regarding the summit number makes the statement incorrect.


Statement 2 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity aims to improve connectivity across various modes of transport, it's not solely focused on air transport.  It encompasses a broader vision, including road, rail, and maritime connectivity, to facilitate trade and regional integration.


Statement 3 is correct. Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter in 2024 was the final piece of the puzzle, completing the ratification process by all member states. This brought the Charter into force, providing a stronger legal and institutional framework for the organization.


**4. With reference to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), consider the following statements:**

1. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership, announced in the Wilmington Declaration, focuses exclusively on combating breast cancer.
2. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" aims to promote sustainable port infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region.
3. The Maritime Initiative for Training in the Indo-Pacific (MAITRI) is a completely new initiative unrelated to any previous Quad initiatives.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "Quad Cancer Moonshot" partnership has a broader focus than just breast cancer. It aims to combat cervical cancer, a significant health challenge in the Indo-Pacific region. The specificity of only breast cancer is a misleading detail.


Statement 2 is correct. The "Quad Ports of the Future Partnership" is indeed focused on promoting sustainable and resilient port infrastructure development in the Indo-Pacific region, reflecting the importance of maritime connectivity and trade.


Statement 3 is incorrect. MAITRI builds upon and leverages existing Quad initiatives, particularly the Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness (IPMDA), launched in 2022.  It doesn't represent a completely independent and unrelated initiative.  The claim of being entirely new and unrelated is the misleading component.


**5. With reference to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), consider the following statements:**

1. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively tracks incidents related to the theft of nuclear weapons.
2. The IAEA's Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques to improve agricultural productivity and enhance food security.
3. The IAEA's Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes the use of nuclear energy as a means of achieving net-zero emissions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors a broader range of incidents related to nuclear material, including theft, loss, and illicit trafficking of nuclear materials, not just nuclear weapons.  Focusing solely on nuclear weapons is a significant oversimplification.


Statement 2 is correct. The Atoms4Food program effectively uses nuclear techniques and isotopes in agriculture to improve crop yields, enhance food quality, and address various agricultural challenges, thus contributing significantly to food security.


Statement 3 is correct. The Atoms4NetZero initiative promotes the exploration and use of nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source to help nations achieve their net-zero emissions targets. This reflects the growing interest in nuclear energy as a potential solution to climate change.


**1. With reference to global economic initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027, primarily focusing on infrastructure projects in developed nations.
2. The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is a G7-led effort focusing solely on renewable energy projects.
3. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is exclusively concerned with marine biodiversity conservation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect because while the PGII does aim to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 and focuses on infrastructure, its target is developing nations, not developed ones. The initiative emphasizes sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure development. Statement 2 is incorrect as the "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative, while led by the G7, encompasses a broader range of energy projects beyond just renewable energy; it aims to facilitate access to external investment for clean energy projects, acknowledging the need for a diverse energy mix in the African context.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate; the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) addresses a wider scope than just marine biodiversity. It likely involves sustainable management of ocean resources, combating marine pollution, and promoting sustainable maritime activities.  UPSC often tests nuanced understanding of global initiatives, and it's crucial to avoid simplistic interpretations.  The correct response highlights the need for a detailed understanding of the specifics of each initiative.


**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade relations between India and the Middle East, excluding Europe.
2. The IMEC initiative is solely driven by India, without any involvement from Middle Eastern or European nations.
3. IMEC's primary objective is to reduce regional trade barriers and promote free trade agreements.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 misrepresents IMEC's scope; it's designed to improve connectivity and trade among India, the Middle East, and Europe, not just between India and the Middle East.  Statement 2 is false because IMEC is a collaborative initiative involving multiple stakeholders from India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It's not a unilaterally driven project by India.  Statement 3 is also inaccurate; while reducing trade barriers might be a consequence, IMEC's primary focus is likely on enhancing connectivity (transport, communication, etc.) which facilitates trade and economic cooperation among the three regions. The corridor aims to create a more efficient and integrated economic space. The UPSC often emphasizes understanding the collaborative and multi-faceted nature of such economic corridors.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and joint military operations among member states.
2.  Belarus's admission as the 10th member significantly strengthens the SCO's economic influence in South America.
3.  The SCO's "Initiative ‘On World Unity for a Just Peace, Harmony and Development’" primarily focuses on humanitarian aid and disaster relief.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; while security cooperation is a key aspect of the SCO, its focus extends beyond military alliances to encompass economic, cultural, and political cooperation.  The SCO is not primarily a military alliance. Statement 2 is false because Belarus's admission as a member expands the SCO's reach geographically, but primarily within Eurasia, not South America. Statement 3 misinterprets the initiative's scope; the initiative aims for broader peace and development goals, potentially encompassing a wider range of cooperative actions beyond just humanitarian aid and disaster relief. It's a high-level aspirational goal rather than a specific program.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of regional organizations and their nuanced objectives, requiring a deeper understanding than simplistic characterizations.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates under a fixed, permanent organizational structure with a dedicated secretariat.
2. The G7's initiatives are exclusively focused on addressing economic challenges among its member states.
3. India's participation in the G7 summit as an outreach country implies full membership status.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating presidency sets the annual agenda.  It's a forum for cooperation rather than a formal organization. Statement 2 is false because the G7's scope extends beyond its member states' economic concerns to include broader global issues, such as climate change, global health, and development.  Statement 3 is incorrect; outreach country status does not equate to full membership. It signifies participation in specific summits or initiatives but doesn't grant full voting rights or decision-making power within the G7 framework.  The UPSC requires knowledge of the structures and functioning of international organizations, highlighting the differences between formal membership and participation in their meetings.


**5. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

2. The US's unilateral list of "State Sponsors of Terrorism" is based solely on objective criteria and international consensus.
3.  NAM's membership is restricted to countries that have never aligned with any major power bloc.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; NAM's stance on Cuba reflects its commitment to defending the interests of developing nations and opposing unilateral sanctions, not alignment with US policy.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the US list is often criticized for being subjective, politically motivated, and lacking a transparent, universally accepted process.  Statement 3 is also false;  NAM's membership includes countries with diverse historical alignments, the defining feature being non-alignment with major power blocs during the Cold War and a commitment to independent foreign policy. The UPSC expects a nuanced understanding of NAM's historical context and its evolving role in international affairs.  The question aims to test the candidate's ability to differentiate between NAM's principles and the complexities of geopolitical realities.


**6. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India's contribution to the Commonwealth's budget is the largest among all member states.

3.  All decisions within the Commonwealth are made through a majority vote system.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false; while India is a significant contributor to the Commonwealth, it's not the largest contributor.  The exact figures vary, but it's not the largest contributor. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Commonwealth Sub Window, while funded by India, is designed to support development projects across various Commonwealth countries, not solely India's goals. It's a collaborative initiative. Statement 3 is false; decisions within the Commonwealth are typically made by consensus, not majority vote. This reflects its emphasis on cooperation and mutual agreement among diverse member states.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of international organizations and their decision-making processes, emphasizing the importance of understanding nuances in their operational mechanisms.


**7. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF Supply Chain Council is solely responsible for crisis response and emergency management related to supply chain disruptions.
2. India is the chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
3. The Labor Rights Advisory Board under the IPEF focuses on enhancing worker rights and skills development only within India.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; the IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses on strengthening supply chains, while the Crisis Response Network is specifically for collective emergency responses to disruptions. They have distinct roles. Statement 2 is incorrect; India is the *vice-chair*, not the chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.  Statement 3 is false; the Labor Rights Advisory Board's focus on worker rights and skills development is regional, encompassing all IPEF partner countries, not limited to India.  The UPSC frequently assesses understanding of regional economic frameworks and their intricate structures. The question tests the ability to distinguish between the different components and their respective functions.


**8. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA's primary objective is to eliminate all trade barriers between ASEAN and India immediately.
2. India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN under the AITIGA framework.
3. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting of AITIGA focuses exclusively on resolving trade disputes.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; AITIGA aims to reduce, not eliminate immediately, trade barriers.  The process of trade liberalization takes time and involves gradual reductions.  Statement 2 is false; India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with ASEAN under AITIGA.  Statement 3 is incorrect; while resolving trade disputes might be a part of the 5th Joint Committee Meeting's agenda, it's not the sole focus.  The meetings review the overall implementation of AITIGA, discuss trade facilitation measures, and address various aspects of economic cooperation.  The UPSC expects an understanding of trade agreements and the complexities of international trade relations.  The question tests the understanding of the nuances of trade agreements and their implementation processes.


**9. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1. SAARC's currency swap framework is exclusively designed for bilateral transactions between India and other SAARC members.
2.  All decisions within SAARC require a two-thirds majority vote among member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; SAARC's currency swap framework is intended for regional cooperation and financial stability among all participating SAARC members, not just bilateral transactions with India. Statement 2 is incorrect; SAARC operates on a principle of *unanimity*, meaning all member states must agree for a decision to be taken.  A majority vote system is not used.  Statement 3 is false; while SAFTA aims to reduce tariffs, it hasn't completely eliminated them among all SAARC nations.  There are still some remaining tariffs and non-tariff barriers. The UPSC emphasizes understanding the functioning of regional organizations and the challenges they face in achieving their objectives. The question tests the candidate's knowledge of SAARC's decision-making process and the limitations of its trade agreements.

3. All BIMSTEC member states ratified the BIMSTEC Charter simultaneously.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are correct. Statement 1 is false; the entry into force of the BIMSTEC Charter doesn't automatically create a BIMSTEC parliament.  The charter sets the framework for cooperation, but the formation of new institutions would require further agreements. Statement 2 is incorrect; BIMSTEC's focus areas are multi-sectoral, encompassing trade, security, environment, agriculture, people-to-people contact, science and technology, and connectivity.  It's not restricted to only trade and security. Statement 3 is false; while the charter's entry into force required ratification by all member states, the ratifications didn't happen simultaneously.  The process took time as each member state followed its own internal procedures.  The UPSC often assesses understanding of regional organizations and their operational mechanisms.  The question tests the candidate's knowledge of BIMSTEC's structure and the process of treaty ratification.

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; while UNPK involves military components, its operations encompass a broader range of activities including civilian policing, humanitarian assistance, and election monitoring. It's not solely focused on military interventions.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India is a significant contributor to UNPK, providing both military personnel and financial support.  Statement 3 is false; UNPK received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1988, recognizing its significant contributions to international peace and security.  The UPSC often tests knowledge of UN peacekeeping operations and the role of various countries in contributing to them. The question aims to assess the candidate's understanding of the multi-faceted nature of UN peacekeeping and India's significant role in it.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; UNCTAD's reports cover both developed and developing economies, focusing on trade, development, and investment issues relevant to all countries.  Statement 2 is false; UNCTAD played a crucial role in implementing the Addis Ababa Agenda, which focuses on financing for development.

2.  Significant defense cooperation exists between the two nations, including joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN.
3.  Both countries actively engage in various multilateral platforms, including SAARC, BIMSTEC, BBIN, and IORA, but have differing approaches to regional security cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia. However, India is the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  China holds that position.  The statement's inaccuracy makes it incorrect as it presents itself as a completely accurate fact.

Statement 2 is correct.  India and Bangladesh have a robust defense cooperation framework, evident in joint military exercises like SAMPRITI and MILAN. This strengthens their bilateral security relationship.

Statement 3 is partially correct.  While both countries participate in the mentioned multilateral platforms, their approaches to regional security, particularly concerning issues like cross-border terrorism and water sharing, sometimes differ. This divergence in approach necessitates a more nuanced understanding than the statement suggests. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to cross-border electricity trade in South Asia, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the India-Bangladesh electricity corridor is planned,  the statement wrongly claims its full operational status.  The project is still under development and is not yet fully operational. This factual inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.

Statement 2 is correct.  India and Nepal are indeed collaborating on hydropower projects like Arun III and Upper Karnali, aiming to enhance energy security and trade.  These projects represent a key aspect of their bilateral energy cooperation.

Statement 3 is partially correct. The projects mentioned reflect a successful history of energy cooperation between India and Bhutan. However, the claim about current hurdles due to environmental concerns is an oversimplification. While environmental considerations are always part of such projects, the statement's implication that major roadblocks currently exist needs further substantiation and is not a fully accurate statement.  The statement is therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives, advocating for the withdrawal of Indian military personnel, significantly impacted the bilateral relationship, leading to a complete breakdown in cooperation.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign did indeed create tensions, but it did not lead to a *complete* breakdown in cooperation between India and the Maldives.  While it strained relations, diplomatic efforts and continued engagement prevented a total collapse.  The statement's exaggeration renders it inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. India's commitment to strengthening its relationship with the Maldives is evident in its various initiatives. Building the Coast Guard base and providing grants for HICDPs are examples of this commitment.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure initiative where India plays a major role in its development and funding, contradicting the statement's claim of zero Indian involvement.  This factual inaccuracy makes the statement incorrect.


**4. Consider the following statements about India-Bhutan relations:**

1. The Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation, signed in 1949 and renewed in 2007, forms the bedrock of India-Bhutan relations, granting India significant influence over Bhutanese foreign policy decisions.

3.  The initiative for Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, and Nepal (BBIN) has been fully endorsed and implemented by all four countries, facilitating seamless regional cooperation in various sectors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. The 1949 treaty is indeed foundational, but the statement's implication of significant influence over Bhutanese foreign policy is an oversimplification.  While close cooperation exists, Bhutan maintains its sovereignty and independent decision-making.  The statement is therefore incorrect in its broad claim.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives was primarily focused on the withdrawal of Indian military personnel and a perceived excessive Indian influence, not economic aid.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the CSA can indirectly benefit tourism by stabilizing the Maldivian economy, its primary aim is to help Maldives manage its foreign exchange reserves and enhance monetary stability.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nepal has withdrawn from the BBIN initiative due to concerns regarding sustainability and environmental issues.  Its participation has not been consistent or unwavering.

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 2007 renewal of the 1949 Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation did not fundamentally alter the power dynamics. While it clarified certain aspects and reaffirmed the commitment to cooperation, it didn't shift power significantly.  The treaty continues to reflect a close and cooperative relationship, but it doesn't grant Bhutan complete autonomy in its foreign policy. India continues to play a significant role in Bhutan's security and defense.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While hydropower is a significant component of India's investment in Bhutan, it is not the sole focus. India invests in various sectors, including infrastructure development, education, and other areas crucial for Bhutan's economic and social development.  The investments are strategically planned to support Bhutan's overall development goals.

Statement 3 is correct. The Gelephu Mindfulness City project is primarily aimed at enhancing connectivity between Bhutan and Assam, thereby improving trade and people-to-people contact. While it has broader developmental goals, the core objective is improved infrastructure linking the two regions.  The project's focus on mindfulness is a secondary aspect, not the primary driver.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is not a formally demarcated border.  It is a de facto boundary, and the lack of a mutually agreed-upon, formally defined border is a major source of contention between India and China.  There are differing perceptions of the LAC's location in various sectors, leading to frequent border disputes.

Statement 2 is correct. The Galwan clash of 2020 was indeed a major escalation and the deadliest border clash between India and China since the 1962 war. This incident highlighted the fragility of the peace along the LAC and underscored the complexities of the border issue.

Statement 3 is incorrect. China does claim Arunachal Pradesh as part of its territory, but its claim is not based on its interpretation of the McMahon Line.  Rather, China rejects the McMahon Line's legitimacy altogether, claiming that it was signed without China's proper consent.  China's claim is based on historical maps and arguments that predate the McMahon Line.

(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the 1950 treaty establishes a close relationship, it doesn't grant Nepal complete autonomy in its foreign policy.  There are aspects of the treaty that have been subject to debate and reinterpretation over the years, reflecting the evolving nature of the bilateral relationship.  Nepal maintains independent relations with other countries but the treaty continues to play a significant role in shaping the overall dynamic.

Statement 2 is correct. India is indeed Nepal's largest trading partner and a major source of FDI.  This economic interdependence is a critical aspect of the India-Nepal relationship, shaping various aspects of cooperation and also creating potential points of friction.

Statement 3 is correct. The Kalapani dispute centers on the differing interpretations of the Kali River's origin.  This geographical ambiguity contributes to the ongoing territorial disagreement, with each country basing its claim on its interpretation of the river's source and the resulting boundary delineation.  This highlights the complexity of border demarcation in mountainous and geographically challenging regions.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct.  While PMLA, 2002, is the primary legislation against money laundering, UAPA, 1967, also has provisions relevant to combating terrorist financing, though its primary focus is broader than just financial crimes.  The statement is partially correct because it accurately identifies PMLA's role, but its description of UAPA's exclusive focus is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956. The Directorate of Enforcement (ED), established in 1956, also plays a role in combating money laundering but is distinct from the FIU. The statement incorrectly states both the establishment year and the primary role of FIU-IND.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The MLAT portal facilitates international cooperation in various areas of criminal justice, including money laundering and terrorist financing, not solely the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The statement incorrectly limits the scope of the MLAT portal.  Only statement 1 contains a partially correct element, making (a) the most accurate response.

**2. With reference to international organizations and their initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction through a peer-review process by FATF members.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010.
2. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) released reports highlighting cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, with regions like the Triple Frontier Area and the Golden Triangle (now Death Triangle) being particularly affected.  Cannabis legalization has occurred in certain jurisdictions.
3. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)'s Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) monitors and reports illicit nuclear trafficking, while its other programs include Atoms4Food, Atoms4NetZero, and the International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles.

(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect information about the respective international organizations and their activities.  The FATF's role in evaluating anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing measures is correctly described, along with the timeline of India's evaluation. The UNODC's reports on drug abuse, including the identification of most abused substances and affected regions, are accurately summarized. The IAEA's ITDB and its other key programs are also correctly described.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements present. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**3. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Maldives have adopted a vision for a “Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership,” launched RuPay cards in the Maldives, and signed a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) to help stabilize the Maldivian economy.  India has undertaken projects like the Greater Male Connectivity Project.
2.  India's relations with China include significant trade (China being India's largest trading partner in goods), but also border disputes along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), particularly in the Western Sector (Ladakh), where differing interpretations of historical border lines exist.
3.  India and Singapore have elevated their strategic partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership,  signed a Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement (CECA), and collaborate on initiatives like Project Nexus for cross-border payments, involving the Unified Payments Interface (UPI).

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately portray aspects of India's bilateral relationships. The statement on India-Maldives relations correctly highlights key economic and security cooperation initiatives. The statement on India-China relations accurately describes the trade relationship and the complexities of the border dispute, including the different interpretations of historical border lines in Ladakh. The statement on India-Singapore relations accurately reflects the enhanced partnership, economic agreements, and collaborative fintech initiatives like Project Nexus.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making option (d) the only valid choice.


**4. With reference to international collaborations and initiatives, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention), ratified by India, is supplemented by the UN Convention Against Corruption, 2003, and is supported by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Regional initiatives like SAWEN (South Asia Wildlife Enforcement Network) also exist.
2.  The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to mobilize investment for infrastructure projects in developing nations, while other initiatives like the G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) and the G7 Oil Price Cap Coalition also exist.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Each statement accurately describes a different aspect of international collaboration and initiatives. Statement 1 correctly outlines the UNTOC, its supplementary conventions, and relevant regional initiatives. Statement 2 accurately details the PGII and mentions other G7-led initiatives. Statement 3 correctly describes NAM's stance on Cuba's inclusion on the US terrorism list and the broader implications for Global South countries.  Therefore, all three statements are factually accurate, making option (d) the correct answer.  Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete and therefore incorrect.


**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII was launched in 2021 with the primary aim of promoting sustainable infrastructure development in developing countries.
2. The initiative targets to mobilize a total of $500 billion in funding by 2026, focusing primarily on renewable energy projects.
3.  The PGII is solely funded by G7 nations and excludes participation from other global partners.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is partially incorrect; while the PGII does aim for sustainable infrastructure, its launch year was 2022, not 2021.  Furthermore, its scope is broader than just sustainable infrastructure, encompassing quality and inclusive infrastructure. Statement 2 is incorrect on multiple counts. The target funding is $600 billion, not $500 billion, and the focus is not solely on renewable energy; it encompasses a broader range of sustainable infrastructure projects.  Statement 3 is also incorrect.  While the G7 is a key driver of the PGII, it's not solely funded by them and actively seeks participation from other global partners to achieve its ambitious goals. The PGII aims for a multilateral approach to infrastructure development.


**2. With reference to India's trade relations with ASEAN, consider the following statements:**

1. The ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA) was signed in 2010 with the primary objective of eliminating all trade barriers between India and ASEAN member states.
2.  India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN, driven by its strong exports of IT services and manufactured goods.
3. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA recently concluded with an agreement to significantly expand the scope of the agreement to include services trade.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect; AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2010, and it doesn't aim to eliminate *all* trade barriers, but rather to significantly reduce them.  Statement 2 is incorrect; India has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, not a surplus. This is a crucial point reflecting the imbalance in trade flows.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; while the 5th Joint Committee Meeting reviewed AITIGA, there's no mention of an agreement to significantly expand it to include services trade in the provided text. The focus was on reviewing the existing agreement on goods.


**3. With reference to the SAARC Currency Swap Framework, consider the following statements:**

1. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced the SAARC Currency Swap Framework for the period 2023-2026.
2. This framework allows member countries to exchange their currencies at a predetermined rate to manage exchange rate volatility and enhance regional financial stability.
3.  The framework is designed to replace the existing bilateral currency swap agreements between India and other SAARC member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the framework's timeframe is 2024-2027, not 2023-2026.  Statement 2 correctly describes the core function of a currency swap agreement (CSA) – managing exchange rate fluctuations and bolstering financial stability.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the SAARC Currency Swap Framework is a new initiative and doesn't replace existing bilateral agreements; it acts as a supplementary framework.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes an aspect of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework.


**4. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership between India and Singapore was established in 2015.
2.  Singapore is consistently India’s largest trading partner globally.
3. Project Nexus, a collaborative initiative between India and Singapore, aims to facilitate cross-border payments by connecting their domestic fast payment systems.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership was elevated to that level in 2024, not established in 2015.  The initial partnership was established earlier, but the upgrade happened in 2024.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while Singapore is a major trading partner for India, it's not consistently the largest globally.  The provided text mentions it as India's largest trade partner within ASEAN and its 6th largest globally in 2023-24. Statement 3 accurately describes Project Nexus and its objective. Therefore, only statement 3 is correct.


**5. With reference to India's engagement with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. India's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) by the FATF was first adopted in 2015.
2. The MER assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
3.  India's MER highlighted significant deficiencies in its legislative framework for combating money laundering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2015.  Statement 2 accurately describes the purpose of the MER. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the text mentions India's measures to combat money laundering, it does not suggest any significant deficiencies in its legislative framework were highlighted in the MER.  The provided text focuses on the measures taken, not deficiencies.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.


**6. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing trade and investment flows between India, the Middle East, and Europe through improved infrastructure connectivity.
2. The IMEC is a fully operational initiative with several key projects already underway.
3. The IMEC's development is primarily driven by bilateral agreements between India and individual countries in the Middle East and Europe.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately reflects the core objective of the IMEC – to boost economic ties through enhanced connectivity.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the IMEC is mentioned as a future cornerstone of global connectivity, implying it's not yet fully operational.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the text mentions the IMEC as a corridor for global connectivity, suggesting a broader, multilateral approach rather than solely relying on bilateral agreements.  Therefore, only statement 1 is correct.


**7. With reference to the India-US trade relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-US Trade Policy Forum was established in 2006 to address trade disputes and promote bilateral trade.
2. India consistently maintains a trade deficit with the United States.
3. The Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) has significantly hampered bilateral trade between India and the United States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the India-US Trade Policy Forum was established in 2005, not 2006.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the provided text mentions India having a trade *surplus*, not a deficit, with the US. Statement 3 is incorrect; while CAATSA is mentioned as a potential challenge,  the text doesn't state it has significantly hampered bilateral trade. The text highlights CAATSA as a potential risk, not a significant impediment. Therefore, none of the statements are entirely correct.


**8. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. India was elected as the Chair of IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2.  The IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement established three bodies: a Supply Chain Council, a Crisis Response Network, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board.
3. The IPEF primarily focuses on strengthening security cooperation among Indo-Pacific nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; India was elected as the *Vice-Chair*, not the Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council. Statement 2 correctly outlines the three bodies established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement. Statement 3 is incorrect; while the IPEF has security implications, its primary focus is on economic cooperation and strengthening supply chains within the Indo-Pacific region, not solely security. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**9. With reference to the TAPI Gas Pipeline Project, consider the following statements:**

1. The TAPI pipeline is designed to transport natural gas from the Galkynysh gas field in northeastern Turkmenistan.
2. The pipeline's route spans approximately 1,500 kilometers across Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India.
3. The TAPI project was officially launched in the early 2000s.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; the Galkynysh gas field is in southeastern Turkmenistan, not northeastern.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the pipeline's length is approximately 1,800 kilometers, not 1,500 kilometers. Statement 3 is incorrect; the project emerged in the mid-1990s, not the early 2000s.  Therefore, only a modified version of statement 1 would be correct.  Given the options, (a) is the closest to being correct, although it contains a minor geographical inaccuracy.


**10. With reference to the India-Bangladesh relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2.  The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports natural gas from India to Bangladesh.
3.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) All three


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, but India is the second-largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  Statement 2 is incorrect; the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports fuel oil, not natural gas. Statement 3 correctly describes the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant as a joint venture.  Therefore, only statements 1 (with a minor correction) and 3 are correct.  Given the options, (c) is the most appropriate.


**1. Consider the following statements about the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1.  Jagjit Pavadia's recent re-election to the INCB signifies India's continued commitment to international drug control efforts.
2.  The INCB's mandate primarily focuses on monitoring and controlling the production and trafficking of cannabis, given its status as the most abused drug globally.
3.  The INCB's reports directly influence the legal frameworks and policies related to drug control adopted by individual countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  Jagjit Pavadia's re-election highlights India's active participation and influence within the INCB, demonstrating a sustained commitment to international drug control collaborations and strategies.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While cannabis is indeed the most abused drug according to UNODC reports, the INCB's mandate is broader than just cannabis. It encompasses a wide range of controlled substances and aims to monitor and regulate the global production, trade, and use of all substances under the international drug control conventions.  The INCB's focus extends to opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and other controlled substances, reflecting the multifaceted nature of the global drug problem.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While INCB reports provide crucial data and analysis that inform international drug control discussions, they do not directly dictate national legal frameworks or policies.  Individual countries retain sovereignty over their domestic drug control legislation and policies, although they are expected to align with international treaties and conventions. The influence of INCB reports is indirect, acting as a source of information and recommendations for policymakers.


**2. With reference to the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The UNTOC, also known as the Palermo Convention, establishes a comprehensive framework for international cooperation in combating various forms of transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking and money laundering.
2.  India's ratification of the UNTOC signifies its commitment to international standards against corruption, as the UN Convention Against Corruption (2003) is a direct amendment to UNTOC.
3.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) serves as the secretariat for UNTOC and plays a crucial role in facilitating information sharing and coordinating international efforts to implement the Convention's provisions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 3 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The UNTOC provides a robust framework for international collaboration to combat transnational organized crime, encompassing a broad spectrum of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, human trafficking, and money laundering.  It establishes mechanisms for cooperation, information exchange, and mutual legal assistance among signatory states.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UN Convention Against Corruption (2003) is a separate, though complementary, international instrument that addresses corruption specifically. While both conventions aim to combat transnational crime, they are distinct legal instruments, not directly amendatory of each other.  India's ratification of both shows its commitment to these areas but doesn't imply one is an amendment of the other.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNODC plays a vital role in supporting the implementation of the UNTOC as its secretariat.  It facilitates information sharing, provides technical assistance to member states, and coordinates international efforts to combat transnational organized crime.  Its initiatives, such as TOCTA and GFP, directly contribute to the UNTOC's objectives.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1.  The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs) assess a country’s effectiveness in combating money laundering and terrorist financing, but exclude the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
2.  India's MER, first adopted in 2010, undergoes periodic review to assess the ongoing effectiveness of India's measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing.
3.  The FATF's recommendations are legally binding on member countries, ensuring consistent implementation of global anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing standards.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MERs comprehensively assess a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  All three areas are integral parts of the FATF's evaluation process.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's MER is subject to periodic review, reflecting the dynamic nature of money laundering and terrorist financing techniques.  Regular updates ensure that the assessment accurately reflects the ongoing effectiveness of a country's countermeasures.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The FATF's recommendations are not legally binding.  While they establish international standards, their implementation depends on individual countries' domestic legal frameworks and enforcement mechanisms.  The FATF relies on peer pressure and international cooperation to encourage compliance with its recommendations.  The lack of legal binding power is a key aspect of the FATF's operational model.


**4. With reference to the Global Operational Network of Anti-Corruption Law Enforcement Authorities (GlobE) Network, consider the following statements:**

1.  India's election to the GlobE Network's steering committee strengthens its role in international anti-corruption initiatives and facilitates cooperation with other law enforcement agencies globally.
2.  The GlobE Network primarily focuses on providing financial and technical assistance to developing countries to enhance their capacity to combat corruption.
3.  Membership in the GlobE Network is limited to countries that have ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption, thereby ensuring a high level of commitment to anti-corruption efforts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. India's inclusion in the GlobE Network's steering committee underscores its increasing involvement in international anti-corruption efforts and provides a platform for collaboration with other nations to combat corruption effectively.  This elevates India's profile in global anti-corruption governance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the GlobE Network aims to improve global anti-corruption efforts, its primary focus is not on direct financial and technical aid.  The network fosters information sharing, operational cooperation, and best practice exchanges among its members.  Financial and technical assistance might be facilitated through other channels but isn't the core function of GlobE.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While GlobE Network membership likely attracts countries committed to anti-corruption, there is no formal requirement for ratification of the UN Convention Against Corruption for membership.  The network's membership criteria may involve other factors related to a country's demonstrated commitment and capacity to combat corruption.  The network focuses on practical cooperation rather than strict adherence to specific treaties.


**5. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1.  The CWC prohibits the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, setting strict verification mechanisms to ensure compliance.
2.  India's enactment of the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, demonstrates its adherence to the CWC's provisions and its commitment to international norms against chemical warfare.
3.  The CWC's implementation is solely managed by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW), with no role for the UN in its oversight or enforcement.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The CWC establishes a comprehensive framework for the elimination of chemical weapons, encompassing prohibitions on development, production, stockpiling, and use. It also incorporates stringent verification measures to ensure compliance by member states.

Statement 2 is correct. India's domestic legislation, the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, aligns its national laws with the CWC's international standards, demonstrating its commitment to the treaty's goals and principles.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the OPCW plays a central role in implementing the CWC, the UN also has a significant involvement. The UN Security Council has adopted resolutions supporting the CWC and its objectives.  The UN's role is primarily in reinforcing the international legal framework against chemical weapons and promoting compliance through diplomatic initiatives.  The OPCW and UN have a cooperative relationship concerning the CWC.


**1. With reference to international treaties and conventions related to weapons, consider the following statements:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, but allows for their use in self-defense.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 mandates the complete destruction of all chemical weapons stockpiles by signatory nations within a specified timeframe.
3. The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but excludes crimes committed by state officials acting in their official capacity.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, but it does *not* allow for their use in self-defense.  The convention is based on the principle of complete prohibition.  Any use of biological weapons, regardless of circumstance, is a violation.

Statement 2 is correct. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention aims for the complete elimination of chemical weapons.  Signatory states are obligated to destroy their chemical weapon stockpiles according to a strict schedule and verification process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Rome Statute establishes the ICC with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  Crimes committed by state officials are *not* excluded if they meet the criteria defined by the Statute.  The principle of complementarity is relevant, meaning the ICC only intervenes if national courts are unwilling or unable to genuinely prosecute such crimes.


**2. With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU) and its significance, consider the following statements:**

1. The UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, responsible for coordinating international postal services and setting global standards for mail delivery.  India's postal service, India Post, is not a member of this Union.
2. India Post celebrated its 170th anniversary in conjunction with the UPU's 150th anniversary.
3. The UPU's primary focus is on facilitating cross-border mail delivery, but it also plays a role in promoting financial inclusion through postal banking services.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UPU is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations and is responsible for coordinating international postal services.  Critically, India Post *is* a member of the UPU, a crucial aspect of its international operations.

Statement 2 is correct.  The provided text correctly states that India Post celebrated its 170th anniversary concurrently with the UPU's 150th anniversary.

Statement 3 is partially correct. While the UPU's primary function is coordinating international mail, its influence extends to aspects of financial inclusion.  The role of postal banking services in various countries is indirectly impacted by the UPU's framework, but this is not its central or primary focus.  The statement is misleading due to the emphasis on this aspect.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and its Mutual Evaluation Reports (MERs), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's MER process assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but does not consider the country's domestic laws.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and has been subsequently updated to reflect improvements in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.
3. The FATF's recommendations are legally binding on all member countries, ensuring a consistent global approach to combating financial crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MERs comprehensively assess a country's measures, including its legislative frameworks (like the PMLA and UAPA in India's case), institutional structures (FIU-IND and ED), and practical initiatives to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. The assessment goes beyond just evaluating the intentions, and also checks the implementation of the laws.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was initially adopted in 2010, and subsequent updates reflect ongoing efforts to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing mechanisms.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FATF's recommendations are *not* legally binding.  The organization relies on peer pressure and international cooperation to encourage member countries to adopt and implement its standards.  Compliance is voluntary, though non-compliance can lead to reputational damage and potential financial consequences.


**4. With reference to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and its reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy. The UNODC also tracks the use of other drugs.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report focuses exclusively on illegal wildlife trade impacting endangered species, neglecting other forms of organized crime.
3. The UNODC’s reports highlight the "Golden Triangle" (now renamed "Death Triangle") and the "Golden Crescent" (now renamed "Death Crescent") as significant regions for drug production and trafficking, but does not consider the impact of cannabis legalization in various countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. While the specific ranking of drug abuse might fluctuate slightly from year to year based on data, cannabis is consistently highlighted as a major concern in UNODC reports. The report focuses on various drugs and their effects.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report is indeed concerned with illegal wildlife trade, but it's part of a broader mandate that also addresses other forms of transnational organized crime, including drug trafficking and other illicit activities.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNODC reports consistently mention the regions mentioned, and also takes into account the impact of cannabis legalization in various jurisdictions on global drug trends. This is a significant factor influencing the reports.


**5. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to the armed forces in designated "disturbed areas," including the power to arrest and search premises without warrants, but does not allow them to open fire without prior warning.
2. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, but only the central government can declare an area as "disturbed".
3.  The Act provides immunity to armed forces personnel from prosecution for actions taken under AFSPA, except with the prior sanction of the central government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 3 only
(b) 1 and 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  AFSPA does grant the powers mentioned, and importantly, it *does* allow armed forces to open fire, even without prior warning, in situations deemed necessary to maintain order. This is a highly controversial provision.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect.

(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the FATF's MER also assesses measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to money laundering and terrorist financing.  The scope of the evaluation is broader than just the two crimes mentioned.

Statement 2 is also correct. BIMSTEC's focus areas are broad and cover various aspects of regional cooperation.  However, while infrastructure development is crucial for connectivity, it's not listed as a separate focus area.  The statement accurately reflects the seven officially declared focus areas.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a significant initiative, it's not limited to rail connectivity. It encompasses various modes of transportation to improve regional connectivity, including road, sea, and air links. This makes the statement factually inaccurate, focusing on a narrower aspect of the plan.

(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

This highlights the nuances of bilateral trade relations and the influence of other significant economic players.

Statement 2 is partially correct. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports refined petroleum products, not crude oil. The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint venture, as stated.  This demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of infrastructure projects and their functionalities.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While the PIWTT aims to facilitate trade through inland waterways, it doesn't eliminate all customs duties.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  LEMOA facilitates logistical support and access to bases for each other's forces, but it does not automatically grant the right to deploy troops without further agreements. The agreement focuses on logistical support rather than troop deployment.

Statement 2 is incorrect. COMCASA is specifically designed to facilitate secure communication, and a key component of this is the sharing of sensitive information and intelligence between participating forces.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While an amendment was passed to exempt India from some CAATSA sanctions, the act remains a potential tool for sanctions if India were to engage in actions deemed contrary to US interests.  The US government has the authority to apply CAATSA, regardless of past exemptions.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Katihar-Bornagar corridor is intended to improve electricity trade between India and Bangladesh, not India and Nepal. This highlights the geographic specifics of energy infrastructure projects.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects are joint ventures between India and Nepal, not India and Bhutan. This shows the importance of accurate information about international collaborations.

Statement 3 is correct. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline indeed transports natural gas from India to Nepal, contributing to Nepal's energy security. This demonstrates the practical application of energy cooperation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because India maintains observer status in Pillar I (Trade) of IPEF and is a full member of Pillars II, III, and IV.  Statement 2 is false because the IPEF's Supply Chain Council addresses a broader range of issues concerning supply chain resilience, not solely labor rights. While labor rights are a component, the council's scope is far wider, encompassing diversification, risk mitigation, and enhancing transparency within critical supply chains. Statement 3 is inaccurate as the Crisis Response Network's purpose is to facilitate *collective* emergency responses to supply chain disruptions, involving multilateral cooperation among IPEF partner countries, not just bilateral actions between India and individual partners.  The network aims for coordinated and comprehensive responses to disruptions impacting the entire regional economic ecosystem.


**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. The IMEC is designed to create a more efficient and cost-effective trade route connecting India, the Middle East, and Europe. This involves optimizing existing infrastructure and reducing bureaucratic hurdles like customs procedures to expedite the movement of goods.  Statement 1 is incorrect because the IMEC explicitly involves the Middle East as a crucial link in the corridor, not bypassing it. The corridor leverages the geographic proximity and existing infrastructure of Middle Eastern countries to streamline trade flows.  Statement 3 is false as the IMEC's success relies on active participation and cooperation from all three regions – India, the Middle East, and Europe.  It is a collaborative initiative aimed at creating a mutually beneficial economic corridor.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only

(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is accurate.  Belarus's inclusion in the SCO expands the organization's reach and influence, particularly in Central Asia. This addition has geo-political implications impacting the region's dynamics. Statement 1 is incorrect because while security cooperation is a key element of the SCO, it encompasses a broader range of activities beyond purely military cooperation. The SCO aims for comprehensive security cooperation, including economic and cultural exchanges. Statement 3 is false as the SCO's anti-terrorism strategy, while focusing on regional security, also addresses broader global terrorism concerns through international collaborations and information sharing. The strategy aims to prevent and counter terrorism in all its forms and manifestations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements contain inaccuracies. Statement 1 is incorrect; Operation Crimson Barracuda was the first drug seizure operation conducted by the Indian Navy after joining the CMF, not an anti-piracy operation.  While counter-terrorism is a key focus, the CMF's mandate extends to a wider range of maritime security challenges, including combating piracy, drug trafficking, and other transnational crimes.  Statement 3 is incorrect; India actively participates in CMF operations, contributing personnel and assets to various tasks.  India's role is not merely logistical but involves direct operational engagement. The CMF is a multinational coalition with a broad mandate, and none of the statements accurately capture the nuances of India's involvement and the CMF's activities.


**4. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants unlimited powers to the armed forces, exempting them from all legal accountability.
2. The extension of AFSPA to parts of Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh is a permanent measure, not subject to review.
3. AFSPA's application is consistent across all regions of India where it is enforced, without any regional variations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements misrepresent the AFSPA. Statement 1 is incorrect; while AFSPA grants significant powers to the armed forces, it does not completely exempt them from all legal accountability. There are mechanisms for redressal and accountability, although these are often subject to debate and criticism. Statement 2 is incorrect; the extension of AFSPA is periodically reviewed and is subject to renewal.  It is not a permanent measure.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the application of AFSPA can vary depending on the specific region and the prevailing security situation.  There are regional variations in its implementation.  The AFSPA is a contentious piece of legislation with complex legal and political dimensions, and none of the statements accurately reflect its complexities.


**5. With reference to the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention, the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, and the 1998 Rome Statute, consider the following statements:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention allows for the development of biological weapons for defensive purposes.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention permits the production of chemical weapons for research purposes.
3. The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction exclusively over war crimes committed by heads of state.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, without any exceptions for defensive purposes.  The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention similarly bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons, with limited exceptions for research and development under strict controls.  The Rome Statute establishes the International Criminal Court's jurisdiction over a range of international crimes, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.  Its jurisdiction is not limited to heads of state; it applies to individuals regardless of their position.  These international treaties aim to prevent the use and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and hold individuals accountable for serious international crimes, and none of the statements correctly reflect their provisions.


**6. With reference to the Universal Postal Union (UPU), consider the following statements:**

1. The UPU is a specialized agency of the World Bank, focusing on postal services globally.
2. India Post's 170th anniversary coincides with the UPU's 150th anniversary.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the UPU is a specialized agency of the United Nations, not the World Bank.  It is dedicated to fostering cooperation and coordination among postal administrations worldwide.  Statement 2 is incorrect; while India Post is indeed celebrating its 170th anniversary, this event does not coincide with the UPU's 150th anniversary. The anniversaries are not simultaneous. Statement 3 is incorrect; the UPU's functions extend beyond regulating international postage rates.  It also works on improving postal services, promoting technological advancements, and facilitating international cooperation in the postal sector.  The UPU plays a significant role in the global postal system, and none of the statements accurately depict its functions or history.


**7. With reference to the Five Eyes Alliance, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate regarding the Five Eyes Alliance.  Statement 1 is incorrect; while cybersecurity is a significant concern, the alliance's intelligence sharing encompasses a much broader range of topics, including political, military, and economic intelligence.  Statement 2 is incorrect; membership in the Five Eyes Alliance is extremely exclusive and limited to the five founding members: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It is not open to other countries. Statement 3 is incorrect; each member country has its own unique legal and regulatory frameworks governing intelligence activities. While there is cooperation and coordination, there's not complete uniformity in legal systems. The Five Eyes Alliance is a highly secretive intelligence-sharing partnership with a long history, and none of the statements correctly describe its nature or operations.


**8. With reference to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC+), consider the following statements:**

1. OPEC+'s decisions on oil production are binding on all member countries, irrespective of their individual circumstances.
2. OPEC+ includes only oil-producing countries, excluding any countries that are significant oil consumers.
3. OPEC+'s primary objective is to maintain stable oil prices, disregarding the interests of oil-consuming nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements misrepresent OPEC+. Statement 1 is incorrect; OPEC+'s production decisions are not legally binding on member countries. While there's significant pressure to comply with agreed-upon production quotas, individual countries retain some autonomy in their production decisions based on their own economic and political considerations. Statement 2 is incorrect; OPEC+ includes both oil-producing and some significant oil-consuming countries, reflecting the complex interplay of supply and demand in the global oil market.  Statement 3 is an oversimplification; while maintaining stable oil prices is a key objective, OPEC+ also considers the interests of both producers and consumers, attempting to balance supply and demand to avoid extreme price volatility.  OPEC+ is a complex organization with a significant impact on the global energy market, and none of the statements accurately reflect its operations or objectives.


**9. With reference to the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), consider the following statements:**

1. The AIIB exclusively provides funding for large-scale infrastructure projects in developed economies.
2. The AIIB's lending decisions are solely determined by its member countries' political interests, disregarding economic viability.
3. The AIIB's operations are completely independent of other multilateral development banks, without any collaboration or coordination.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. Statement 1 is incorrect; the AIIB provides funding for infrastructure projects across a range of economies, with a focus on developing countries and emerging markets.  It supports a variety of projects, not just large-scale ones. Statement 2 is incorrect; the AIIB's lending decisions are based on rigorous economic and financial assessments, taking into account project feasibility, environmental sustainability, and other key factors. Political considerations are not the sole determinant.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the AIIB collaborates and coordinates with other multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, to leverage expertise and avoid duplication of efforts.  The AIIB is a significant player in the global infrastructure finance landscape, and none of the statements accurately reflect its operations or principles.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Lake Turkana is situated in both Kenya and Ethiopia. The Omo River is a major source of water but not the only one; other smaller rivers and seasonal streams contribute to the lake's water levels. The recent survey conducted by UNESCO and the World Food Programme actually revealed a high fish potential in Lake Turkana, not a decline.  Lake Turkana is a significant ecological and geographical feature of East Africa, and none of the statements accurately reflect its location, hydrology, or recent findings.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Mount Kilimanjaro is a freestanding mountain, not part of a mountain range. The Uhuru Peak is the highest peak, not the lowest. Mount Kilimanjaro is considered a dormant volcano, not an extinct one, meaning it's not currently erupting but could potentially erupt again in the future.  Mount Kilimanjaro is a prominent landmark in Africa, and none of the statements accurately describe its geological features.


**12. With reference to the Lipulekh Pass, consider the following statements:**

1. The Lipulekh Pass is located solely within the territory of Nepal.
2. The Lipulekh Pass significantly increases travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The Lipulekh Pass is located at the tri-junction of India, China, and Nepal, not solely in Nepal.  The Lipulekh Pass significantly *reduces* travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, not increases it.  Border trade through the Lipulekh Pass was closed during the Covid-19 pandemic, not uninterrupted. The Lipulekh Pass is a strategically important location, and none of the statements accurately depict its geographical location or its role in trade and pilgrimage.

1. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean.
2. The Suez Canal is the longest maritime route between Asia and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are inaccurate. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.  The Suez Canal is the *shortest*, not the longest, maritime route between Asia and Europe. While increased canal tolls might be a contributing factor, India's shift of fuel exports is primarily driven by geopolitical considerations and concerns about the stability of the Suez Canal region.  The Suez Canal is a crucial global shipping route, and none of the statements accurately describe its geographical features or the reasons behind India's recent shift in fuel export routes.


**14. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Bangladesh is India's *largest* trade partner in South Asia, not the smallest.  While SAMPRITI is solely between India and Bangladesh, MILAN is a multinational naval exercise involving several countries, not just India and Bangladesh.  The Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint initiative between India and Bangladesh, not a solely Bangladeshi project. India-Bangladesh relations are multifaceted and encompass various areas of cooperation, and none of the statements accurately reflect the nature of this relationship.

The Arun III and Upper Karnali hydropower projects involve collaborations between India and Nepal, not solely funded by Nepal.  Energy pipelines like TAPI are designed to benefit multiple countries involved in the project, not just India.  Regional energy cooperation in South Asia involves multiple countries and projects, and none of the statements accurately reflect this complexity.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. IBSAMAR VIII is a trilateral exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa. Exercise Pitch Black is a multinational air exercise, not solely a naval exercise.  Exercise Cutlass Express focuses on various maritime security aspects, including counter-piracy and other maritime threats, not exclusively on counter-terrorism.  Multinational military exercises often involve multiple countries and focus on various security challenges, and none of the statements accurately reflect the nature of the exercises mentioned.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Operation Sadbhav is an initiative of the Indian Army, not the Navy, focused on providing HADR to Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. Operation Sadbhavana is an initiative of the Indian Army, not the Air Force, for civic action programs in certain parts of India. Tiger Triumph 2024 is a bilateral tri-service HADR amphibious exercise between India and the US, not a unilateral US exercise.  India's HADR operations are multifaceted, involving various branches of the armed forces and collaborations with other countries, and none of the statements accurately reflect these operations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Chloropicrin has multiple applications, including as a fumigant, antimicrobial, fungicide, herbicide, and nematicide, in addition to its potential use as a warfare agent. The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibits the use of chemical and biological weapons in warfare, and chloropicrin, due to its potential for use as a chemical weapon, falls under this prohibition.  The Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC) does not exempt chloropicrin; it is subject to the convention's provisions. Chloropicrin's dual-use nature and its implications under international law are complex, and none of the statements accurately reflect this.


**19. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC entered into force in 1992.
2.  All countries in the world are parties to the CWC.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The CWC entered into force in 1997, not 1992.  Several countries are not parties to the CWC.  The CWC includes detailed verification measures to ensure compliance, including inspections and reporting requirements, in addition to provisions for the destruction of chemical weapons.  The CWC is a significant international treaty aimed at eliminating chemical weapons, and none of the statements accurately reflect its key features.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect.  While the PMLA, 2002, is a crucial legal framework, other laws and regulations also play a role in combating money laundering in India.  The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956.  The MLAT Portal is designed to facilitate international cooperation in criminal investigations, not exclusively for domestic legal cooperation. India's anti-money laundering framework is complex and involves multiple laws, institutions, and international collaborations; none of the statements accurately represent this.


**21. With reference to the UNODC's reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most abused drug globally.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. The Chagos Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, not the Caribbean Sea. The UK's decision to restore sovereignty is the culmination of a long-standing dispute, not a recent event without prior conflict.  The Chagos Islands hold significant strategic importance due to their location in the Indian Ocean and their proximity to key shipping lanes. The Chagos Islands represent a complex geopolitical issue, and none of the statements accurately depict their location or the history of the sovereignty dispute.


**25. With reference to Rwanda, consider the following statements:**

1. Rwanda is a coastal country in Central Africa.
2. The UK's asylum policy involving Rwanda is solely focused on addressing economic migration.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Rwanda is a landlocked country, not a coastal country. The UK's asylum policy involving Rwanda is intended to address irregular migration, encompassing various factors beyond just economic migration. Lake Kivu forms part of Rwanda's western border, not the eastern border. Rwanda's geographical location and its involvement in the UK's asylum policy are significant, and none of the statements accurately reflect these aspects.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Togo is located in Western Africa, not Eastern Africa. Togo borders Ghana to the west, not Nigeria. The review of bilateral relations indicates a continuation and strengthening of existing cooperation, not a complete lack of prior cooperation. Togo's geographical location and its relations with India are significant, and none of the statements accurately represent these.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Lake Turkana is indeed located in northwestern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia. However, while it is the largest *permanent* desert lake, it's not necessarily the largest desert lake overall, as other lakes might exceed it in size at certain times of the year.  The statement's inaccuracy doesn't invalidate the core geographical location information.

Statement 2 is correct.  The Omo River is the main source of water for Lake Turkana.  This is a crucial element of the lake's hydrology and ecosystem.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that a recent survey revealed *high* fish potential, directly contradicting this statement. This highlights the importance of carefully reading and understanding the provided information.  The inclusion of this incorrect statement serves as a key distractor, testing the candidate's ability to discern factual accuracy from misleading information.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts.  Kilimanjaro is located in Tanzania, not Kenya, and it is the highest peak in Africa, not the second highest. This statement contains two significant errors designed to mislead.

Statement 2 is incorrect regarding the composition. While it is a stratovolcano, it's composed of ash, lava, and rock, not primarily granite and sedimentary rock.  This demonstrates the need for precise knowledge of geological formations.

Statement 3 is correct. Mount Kilimanjaro is indeed a free-standing mountain, a significant geographical feature distinguishing it from mountain ranges. This correct statement is included among plausible distractors to test the candidate's ability to identify the accurate information amidst misleading options.

3. Border trade through the Lipulekh Pass was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Indian traders are seeking its resumption.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The Lipulekh Pass is located at the trijunction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, not Bhutan.  This subtle but significant change in the geographical location is a crucial distractor.

Statement 2 is incorrect in its quantification. While the Lipulekh Pass does reduce travel time for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, there's no specific mention of a 50% reduction in the provided text.  The inclusion of a numerical value adds a layer of complexity and potential for error.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that Indian traders are demanding the resumption of border trade through Lipulekh Pass following its closure during the COVID-19 pandemic. This statement provides a straightforward fact that contrasts with the more nuanced and potentially misleading information in the other statements.


**4. With reference to the Suez Canal route, consider the following statements:**

1. The Suez Canal connects the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean, providing a shorter maritime route between Asia and Europe.
2. Recently, India shifted a portion of its fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal route to the Cape of Good Hope route due to geopolitical factors.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, not the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. This is a fundamental geographical error designed to test the candidate's basic knowledge.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage clearly states that India shifted some fuel exports to Europe from the Suez Canal to the Cape of Good Hope route.  This reflects changing geopolitical realities and trade dynamics.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Suez Canal is located in Egypt, not Sudan. This is a simple geographical fact that serves as a straightforward distractor. The candidate must accurately identify the location of the canal to answer the question correctly.


**5. With reference to the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC), consider the following statements:**

1. The CWC was adopted in 1993 and entered into force in 1998, aiming to eliminate chemical weapons and prevent their future use.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect regarding the dates. The CWC was adopted in 1992 and entered into force in 1997. This seemingly minor detail is a significant distractor, testing the candidate's precise recall of factual information.

Statement 2 is correct. The passage accurately lists Israel, Egypt, North Korea, and South Sudan as non-signatories to the CWC. This serves as a straightforward test of factual recall.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect regarding the year of the act. India is a signatory and party to the CWC and enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, not 2001.  While the core fact about India's participation is correct, the year is slightly off, acting as a subtle distractor.


**6. With reference to Sittwe Port, consider the following statements:**

1. Sittwe Port is a shallow-water port located on the Bay of Bengal coast in the Rakhine State of Myanmar.
2. India has secured the right to operate Sittwe Port, which will enhance trade and transit opportunities for India's Northeast.
3. The development of Sittwe Port is primarily aimed at improving maritime connectivity between India and Bangladesh.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Sittwe Port is described as a *deep-water* port, not a shallow-water port, located at the estuary of the Kaladan River, not directly on the Bay of Bengal coast.  These geographical inaccuracies are designed to test the candidate's knowledge of the port's specifics.

Statement 2 is correct. The text clearly states that India has secured the right to operate Sittwe Port and that this will enhance trade and transit opportunities for India's Northeast.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While improved connectivity with Myanmar is a key objective, the primary focus is not on improving relations with Bangladesh. This statement introduces a completely different country to act as a distractor.


**7. With reference to Saint Martin's Island, consider the following statements:**

1. Saint Martin's Island is located in the southwestern part of the Bay of Bengal.
2.  A sovereignty agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar in 1974 established Bangladesh's ownership of the island.
3. Reports suggest that China has expressed interest in establishing a military base on Saint Martin's Island.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Saint Martin's Island is located in the *northeastern* part of the Bay of Bengal, not the southwestern part.  This is a crucial geographical detail that acts as a strong distractor.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly states that a 1974 agreement between Bangladesh and Myanmar confirmed Bangladesh's sovereignty over Saint Martin's Island.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text mentions that the US, not China, was reported to have considered establishing a military base on the island. This substitution of one major power for another is a highly effective distractor.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on multiple counts. The Seine is France's *second* longest river (after the Loire), not the longest. It flows in a *northwesterly* direction, not southeasterly, and empties into the English Channel, not the Atlantic Ocean.  This statement is riddled with errors to challenge the candidate's understanding of the river's basic characteristics.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the Marne is a tributary of the Seine, the Loire is *not*. The Loire is a separate, major river system.  This statement tests the candidate's knowledge of French river systems.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately states that the Seine River originates near Dijon, France.


**9. With reference to Nagorno-Karabakh, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Nagorno-Karabakh is officially recognized as part of *Azerbaijan*, not Armenia, although it has been a source of conflict and is predominantly populated by ethnic Armenians.  This statement plays on the complexities of the region's political status.

Statement 2 is correct. The text accurately describes Azerbaijan's recent actions in Nagorno-Karabakh and the subsequent withdrawal of Russian peacekeepers.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Nagorno-Karabakh is located in the *South Caucasus*, not Eastern Europe, and its borders are with Azerbaijan (primarily), Armenia, and Iran.  This statement is incorrect in terms of both region and bordering countries.


**10. With reference to the Kursk Region, consider the following statements:**

1. The Kursk Region is located in western Russia, bordering Belarus and Ukraine.
2.  A recent emergency was declared in the Kursk Region due to severe flooding caused by unusually heavy rainfall.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. The Kursk Region is in *central* Russia, not western Russia, and it borders Ukraine, but not Belarus.  The imprecise description of its location is intended to mislead.

Statement 2 is not directly supported by the provided text. While an emergency was declared, the text doesn't specify the cause as flooding. This omission is a crucial element of the distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The passage accurately states that the Kursk Region is situated within the Dnieper and Don river basins.  This represents a straightforward factual element amongst more complex and potentially misleading statements.


**11. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The provided text explicitly mentions the launch of the RuPay card in the Maldives as a key outcome of a recent visit by the Maldivian president.

Statement 2 is correct.  The text also indicates the signing of a Currency Swap Agreement (CSA) between India and the Maldives.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the "India Out" campaign and its impact on India-Maldives relations, highlighting its pro-China stance.  The campaign's aim to drive out Indian influence and promote closer ties with China is a key element of the political context.  


**12. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2010 with the objective of reducing trade barriers and deepening economic ties between ASEAN and India.

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2010.  This seemingly small error is a significant distractor, testing the candidate's attention to detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions the recent 5th Joint Committee Meeting and its purpose of reviewing AITIGA.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The text clearly states that India has a *trade deficit*, not a surplus, with ASEAN under AITIGA. This reversal of trade balance is a crucial detail that tests the candidate's understanding of the economic aspects of the agreement.


**13. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

1. India and Singapore elevated their strategic partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership in 2015.
2.  Singapore is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN and its 5th largest trading partner globally as of 2023-24.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The elevation of the strategic partnership to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership occurred in 2024, not 2015. This is a key date that tests the candidate's knowledge of the chronology of bilateral relations.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. Singapore is indeed India's largest trading partner in ASEAN, but it's India's 6th largest globally, not the 5th, according to the text. This minor numerical discrepancy acts as a subtle distractor.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes Project Nexus and its objective of facilitating cross-border payments.


**14. With reference to Bolivia, consider the following statements:**

1. Bolivia's capital city is La Paz, which also serves as its constitutional capital.

Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided text, adhering to all specified criteria.  Note that due to the nature of the source material (which focuses on various international relations and geopolitical events), creating MCQs that fit perfectly into the "Indian History" category is impossible.  Therefore, the questions will primarily use the "With reference to..." and "Consider the following statements..." formats.


**1. With reference to multilateral peace operations, consider the following statements:**

1.  In 2023, India provided the largest number of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces.
2.  The majority of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 were deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa.
3.  The SIPRI report on multilateral peace operations in 2023 focused solely on the deployment of troops in conflict zones.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect key findings from the SIPRI report on multilateral peace operations in 2023.  India's significant contribution to UN peacekeeping forces is a well-documented fact, highlighting its commitment to international peace and security. Similarly, the concentration of peacekeeping operations in Sub-Saharan Africa reflects ongoing conflicts and instability in the region.  However, statement 3 is incorrect. While troop deployment is a major focus, the SIPRI report likely covers broader aspects of multilateral peace operations, including developments, trends, and challenges faced in various regions.  The report’s scope extends beyond mere troop numbers to encompass the complexities of peacekeeping missions.



**2. With reference to India's bilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise held annually between India and the United States, focusing primarily on naval operations.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is entirely correct. Exercise Tarkash, a counter-terrorism exercise between India and the US, was indeed held in Kolkata.  Statement 1 is partially correct in that Yudh Abhyas is a joint exercise between India and the US, but it's not solely focused on naval operations; it involves the armies of both countries.  Statement 2 is entirely incorrect. Vajra Prahar is an army exercise between India and the US, not an air force exercise between India and France conducted in the Mediterranean.  The Mediterranean Sea is the location for Exercise Varuna, a naval exercise between India and France.  These inaccuracies highlight the need for precise recall of details regarding specific bilateral exercises.


**3. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with ASEAN:**

1. India became a Dialogue Partner with ASEAN in 1992.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. India is indeed a founding member of the ASEAN Future Forum, a platform for sharing ideas and policy recommendations.  Statement 1 is incorrect; India began formal engagement with ASEAN in 1992, but it became a Dialogue Partner in 1996. Statement 2 is also incorrect; the ARF was established in 1994, not 1996. India joined the ARF in 1996.  The precise chronology of India's engagement with ASEAN and the establishment dates of key ASEAN institutions are crucial for a complete understanding of the dynamics of India's foreign policy in the region.


**4. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  The "India Out" campaign in the Maldives advocated for increased Indian military presence.
2.  Operation Neer provided medical assistance to the Maldives during a health crisis.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct.  Operation Neer provided crucial water assistance to the Maldives during a water crisis.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the "India Out" campaign aimed to reduce Indian influence, not increase it. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the Greater Male Connectivity Project is a significant infrastructure initiative undertaken by *India*, not China. These inaccuracies highlight the importance of understanding the nuances of India's relations with its neighbours and the specific nature of its aid and development projects.


**5. With reference to the Kargil War and its aftermath, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Safed Sagar was a naval operation conducted by the Indian Navy to blockade Pakistan's navy.
2. The Kargil Review Committee was chaired by K. Subrahmanyam.
3. Operation Talwar was an air force operation targeting Pakistani troops in high-altitude positions.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct; K. Subrahmanyam did indeed chair the Kargil Review Committee.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Operation Safed Sagar was an air force operation, not a naval one. The naval operation was Operation Talwar. Statement 3 is also incorrect; Operation Talwar was a naval operation, while Operation Safed Sagar was the air force operation targeting high-altitude positions. The confusion between these operations underlines the importance of precisely recalling the roles of different branches of the Indian armed forces during the Kargil War.



**6. With reference to geographical locations, consider the following statements:**

1. Lake Turkana is located in northeastern Kenya and southwestern Ethiopia.
2. Mount Kilimanjaro is the highest peak in Africa and is located in Kenya.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statements 1 and 3 are correct. Lake Turkana's location is accurately described, and the Lipulekh Pass's location at the tri-junction is also accurate.  Statement 2 is incorrect on two counts: Mount Kilimanjaro is located in *Tanzania*, not Kenya, and while it is the highest peak in Africa, the question contains a slight misdirection in the statement.  The precise geographical locations of significant landmarks are essential knowledge for various aspects of UPSC examinations, including geography, international relations, and current events.

(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 1 is correct. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline indeed transports petroleum products. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a joint project between India and *Bangladesh*, not Nepal. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the TAPI pipeline's primary purpose is to transport *natural gas*, not crude oil.  Understanding the specifics of these energy cooperation projects is crucial for comprehending India's regional energy security strategies.


**8. With reference to the weaponization and militarization of space, consider the following statements:**

1.  The 1967 Outer Space Treaty explicitly prohibits the deployment of all types of weapons in space.
2. Russia's veto of the UNSC resolution on weapon-free outer space was based on concerns about the treaty's limitations.
3.  Militarization of space involves deploying weapons in space to target objects in orbit or on Earth.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is entirely accurate. Russia's veto was indeed motivated by concerns that the resolution focused too narrowly on WMDs, while ignoring other potential space-based weapons.  Statement 1 is partially true; the 1967 treaty aims to prevent an arms race in space, but its interpretation and enforcement are complex and subject to debate.  Statement 3 is incorrect; that defines weaponization, not militarization. Militarization refers to the use of space for military purposes without necessarily deploying weapons *in* space.  The distinctions between weaponization and militarization of space are subtle yet crucial for understanding the ongoing geopolitical debate.


**9. With reference to India-Australia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Australia's National Defense Strategy 2024 identifies India as a ‘second-tier security partner’ in the Indo-Pacific region.
2. The Australia-India Indo-Pacific Oceans Initiative Partnership (AIIPOIP) focuses primarily on economic cooperation.

(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 3 is correct. AUSINDEX is indeed a joint maritime exercise between India and Australia.  Statement 1 is incorrect; Australia's 2024 strategy identifies India as a *top-tier* security partner, not second-tier. Statement 2 is also incorrect; AIIPOIP focuses on maritime cooperation, not primarily on economic aspects.  Understanding the strategic nuances of India-Australia relations, including their defense cooperation and their positioning within the Indo-Pacific framework, is crucial.


**10. Consider the following statements about the Colombo Process:**

1. The Colombo Process primarily focuses on addressing issues related to climate change.
2. India recently chaired its first meeting as the Chair of the Colombo Process.
3. Bangladesh is a founding member of the Colombo Process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. India did recently chair its first meeting as Chair of the Colombo Process.  Statement 1 is incorrect; the Colombo Process focuses on irregular migration, not solely on climate change, though climate change may be a contributing factor to migration. Statement 3 is also incorrect; the founding members of the Colombo Process would need further research to verify. The Colombo Process's focus and membership need precise understanding for a complete grasp of regional cooperation initiatives.


**1. Consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The Universal Postal Union (UPU) is indeed a specialized agency of the United Nations, and the provided text correctly states its 150th-anniversary celebration and mentions India Post's concurrent 170th anniversary.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) is explicitly mentioned in the text as being asked to assist *low-income* countries in accessing financial resources, not high-income countries.  This directly contradicts the statement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the Five Eyes Alliance did allow non-citizen residents to join its armed forces, the text specifies this allowance is limited to those from *within* the Five Eyes Alliance, not from all nations.  The statement misrepresents the scope of this policy change.


**2. Consider the following statements:**

1. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention and the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention are both focused on preventing the proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction, but only the Chemical Weapons Convention includes specific provisions for the destruction of existing stockpiles.
2. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) established a court with jurisdiction over war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, but excludes crimes committed by state actors acting on behalf of their government.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is indeed a role model country in the GCI 2024 (Tier 1), the statement inaccurately claims it's among the top 10 globally.  The ranking is not a simple top 10 list. Statement 2 is incorrect. The GCI uses a different categorization; Tier 1 represents the most prepared, not the least, and the scale goes down from there. The statement reverses the meaning of the tiers. Statement 3 is correct. The GCI report indicates that a significant number of countries fall into the "establishing" (Tier 3) or "evolving" (Tier 4) categories concerning their digital services expansion.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. This question underscores the significance of precise understanding of international rankings and classifications.

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India is not only a signatory to the CWC but also enacted the Chemical Weapons Convention Act, 2000, to implement its provisions domestically. The statement is factually inaccurate. Statement 2 is correct. The CWC comprehensively bans the development, production, stockpiling, and use of chemical weapons.  The statement accurately describes the CWC's core mandate. Statement 3 is correct.  The OPCW is indeed responsible for verifying the CWC's implementation by member states. The statement accurately identifies the monitoring body.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct.  This question tests the understanding of international arms control treaties and their implementation mechanisms.  Inaccurate knowledge about such treaties can have serious implications for international security and non-proliferation efforts.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While GlobE does address corruption, its focus is broader than just financial crimes. It addresses various forms of corruption. The statement misrepresents GlobE's scope. Statement 2 is correct. India has indeed been elected to GlobE's steering committee.  The statement accurately reflects India's participation. Statement 3 is incorrect. GlobE's primary mechanism is not financial aid; it operates through cooperation and information sharing among law enforcement agencies. The statement mischaracterizes GlobE's operational methods.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct. This question tests knowledge of international anti-corruption initiatives and the role of various nations in these efforts.  Inaccurate information on such networks can hinder the understanding of global anti-corruption strategies.

(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. IPEF is not a free trade agreement; it's a framework for cooperation on various economic issues, including supply chains, clean energy, and digital trade. The statement mischaracterizes the nature of IPEF. Statement 2 is correct. IPEF has indeed established a Supply Chain Council and a Crisis Response Network, as described. The statement accurately describes IPEF's initiatives. Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPEF's Labor Rights Advisory Board has a broader focus than just the textile industry; it addresses labor rights and workforce development across regional supply chains. The statement restricts the board's scope unnecessarily.  Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  This question requires an understanding of the nuances of international economic frameworks and their mechanisms.  Misinterpreting the nature of such frameworks can lead to inaccurate assessments of their impact and effectiveness.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IMEC involves the Middle East, its scope is broader than just India-Middle East relations; it encompasses connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe. The statement limits IMEC's geographic focus. Statement 2 is correct. The IMEC aims to improve connectivity and reduce transport times and costs across the specified regions. The statement accurately describes IMEC's objectives. Statement 3 is incorrect. The funding sources for IMEC are not limited to the European Union; it's likely a multi-source initiative involving various stakeholders.  The statement is too specific and presumptive about funding. Therefore, only statement 2 is correct.  This question assesses comprehension of major infrastructural projects and their impact on regional trade and connectivity.  Inaccurate understanding of such initiatives can lead to flawed analyses of global trade patterns and regional economic development.

Mount Kilimanjaro's status as Africa's highest peak, its stratovolcanic composition, and its distinction as the world's largest free-standing mountain are all factual.  The Lipulekh Pass's location, significance for the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage, and proximity to the tri-junction are also accurate.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in any of the statements.  Therefore, option (c) is the correct answer.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India and Maldives have established a "Comprehensive Economic and Maritime Security Partnership," and India has introduced the RuPay card in the Maldives.  A currency swap agreement was also signed to support the Maldives' foreign exchange reserves.
2.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline is a cross-border petroleum products pipeline connecting India and Nepal, while the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline facilitates oil transportation between the two countries.
3.  India is Bhutan's largest trading partner, with a trade surplus in India's favor, and it's the leading source of investments in Bhutan.  India has also constructed four major hydroelectric projects in Bhutan.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements reflect accurate aspects of India's bilateral relationships.  The India-Maldives partnership, RuPay card introduction, and currency swap agreement are all documented initiatives. The Motihari-Amlekhganj and India-Bangladesh Friendship pipelines are existing infrastructure projects enhancing energy cooperation.  India's dominant role in Bhutanese trade, investment, and hydropower projects is also well-established.  No statement contains false or misleading information. Therefore, option (d) is correct.


**3. With reference to the India-China border dispute, consider the following statements:**

1. The Line of Actual Control (LAC) is a formally demarcated border between India and China, with a mutually agreed-upon definition across all sectors.
2. The Western Sector of the LAC (Ladakh) involves a dispute over the Johnson Line (India's claim) and the McDonald Line (China's claim).
3.  The Eastern Sector of the LAC (Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim) sees China's claim to Arunachal Pradesh as part of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, with the LAC following the McMahon Line.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is not formally demarcated, and there's no mutually agreed-upon definition. Statements 2 and 3 accurately describe the disputed lines and territorial claims in the Western and Eastern sectors of the LAC. The differing interpretations of the Johnson and McDonald Lines in the West and the McMahon Line's role in the East are key aspects of the ongoing border dispute.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making option (b) the right answer.


**4. With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a 7,200 km-long multi-modal transportation network connecting India, Iran, and Russia, established in 2000, aiming to provide an alternative route to the Suez Canal.
2. The INSTC aims to connect India with Russia and Europe through Iran and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan and offering a shorter route to Afghanistan and Central Asian countries.
3. Chabahar Port, located on the Gulf of Oman, is a key component of the INSTC, facilitating sea routes to Afghanistan and Central Asia, thereby reducing transportation times from India's west coast.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately depict the INSTC's features and objectives. The corridor's length, member countries, establishment year, and aim to provide an alternative to the Suez Canal are correct.  The INSTC's goal of connecting India with Russia and Europe via Iran and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan, is also accurate.  Chabahar Port's role as a crucial component of the INSTC, facilitating access to Afghanistan and Central Asia, is a well-known fact. Therefore, all three statements are correct, making (c) the appropriate answer.


**5. With reference to India's relations with other countries, consider the following statements:**

1.  Malaysia has designated India as its ‘top-tier security partner’ in the Indo-Pacific Region and has initiated joint military exercises, ‘Harimau Shakti,’ with India.
2.  Australia's National Defense Strategy 2024 identifies India as a ‘top-tier security partner’ in the Indo-Pacific Region and both countries have signed the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement.
3.  India and the United Kingdom have a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP), that includes a 2+2 Ministerial dialogue and a Joint Declaration on Maritime Cooperation in the Indo-Pacific.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While India and Malaysia have strong ties including joint military exercises,  Malaysia has not explicitly designated India as its 'top-tier security partner' in official documentation. Statement 2 is correct. Australia's National Defense Strategy 2024 explicitly names India as a top-tier security partner, and the Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement is a well-known fact.  Statement 3 is incorrect.  The Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and related initiatives are associated with India and Australia, not the UK.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct, making (b) the right answer.


**1. With reference to the Financial Services Institution Bureau (FSIB), consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a statutory body in India established by an Act of Parliament.
2.  It primarily recommends candidates for appointment as whole-time directors on the boards of public sector financial services institutions.
3.  The FSIB's recommendations are binding on the government in the appointment process.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1 and 2 only

**Explanation:**

The Financial Services Institution Bureau (FSIB) is indeed a crucial body in India's financial sector, but its nature and powers need closer examination.  Statement 1 is correct: The FSIB is a body established by the government of India, not through an Act of Parliament. It operates under the administrative control of the Ministry of Finance.  Statement 2 is also correct; its primary function is to recommend candidates for appointments to key positions in public sector banks and financial institutions. However, Statement 3 is incorrect. While the FSIB's recommendations carry significant weight, they are not legally binding on the government. The government retains the final authority in the appointment process, considering various factors beyond the FSIB's recommendations.  The government might accept, reject, or modify the recommendations based on its overall assessment of the candidates and the prevailing circumstances. Therefore, options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they don't fully capture the nuanced role of the FSIB.



**2. Consider the following statements about Ways and Means Advances (WMA):**

1. WMA is a short-term loan facility provided by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to the Government of India to meet temporary mismatches in the government's cash flow.
2. The interest rate charged on WMA is always linked to the repo rate but not necessarily 2% higher.
3. The limits for WMA are mutually decided by the Government of India and the RBI, and are reviewed periodically.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (d) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

Ways and Means Advances (WMA) are a critical instrument in managing the Indian government's finances. Let's analyze each statement: Statement 1 is correct: WMA is indeed a short-term borrowing facility, bridging temporary gaps between government revenue and expenditure.  Statement 2 is also correct: The interest rate on WMA is not fixed at 2% above the repo rate; it's linked to the repo rate, but the specific margin can vary. The RBI and the government agree on this margin periodically. Statement 3 is accurate: The RBI and the government jointly determine the WMA limits, keeping in mind the government's short-term cash flow needs and the overall macroeconomic situation. These limits are not static; they're reviewed and adjusted periodically to reflect changing circumstances. Therefore, all three statements are correct, making option (d) the appropriate choice. Options (a), (b), and (c) are incomplete because they only partially address the characteristics of WMAs.



**3. With reference to India's economic policies, consider the following statements:**

1. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) is a consumption-based tax levied on the supply of goods and services.
2.  The Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act primarily aims to reduce the fiscal deficit of the central government.
3. The introduction of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) in India aimed to improve the ease of doing business by streamlining the resolution of distressed assets.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1, 2, and 3
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c) 1, 2, and 3

**Explanation:**

All three statements accurately reflect key aspects of India's economic policies. Statement 1 is correct. GST is indeed a consumption-based tax, levied at various stages of the supply chain, with the final burden falling on the consumer.  Statement 2 is also correct. The FRBM Act's primary objective is to enhance fiscal discipline by setting targets for reducing the fiscal deficit, improving debt management, and promoting greater transparency in government finances.  Statement 3 is accurate. The IBC was introduced to expedite the resolution of stressed assets, thereby improving the ease of doing business. A more efficient insolvency process reduces uncertainty for investors and creditors, thereby attracting greater investment.  Therefore, all three statements are correct, making option (c) the only valid choice. Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they exclude one or more of the correct statements.




**1. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1. CAATSA, enacted in 2017, primarily targets countries with significant economic ties to China and North Korea.
2.  The act allows for the imposition of sanctions on entities engaging in significant transactions with designated adversaries, irrespective of the nature of the transaction.
3. India has been consistently exempted from CAATSA sanctions due to its strategic partnership with the United States.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

CAATSA primarily targets countries with significant economic ties to Russia, Iran, and North Korea, not China.  Statement 1 is incorrect due to this misrepresentation of the primary targets.  Statement 2 is correct; CAATSA sanctions can be applied to a wide range of transactions with designated entities, not just specific ones.  Statement 3 is incorrect. While the US House of Representatives passed an amendment to potentially exempt India for specific purchases (S-400 missile system), this isn't a consistent blanket exemption. India has faced warnings of potential sanctions under CAATSA for other engagements.  Therefore, only statement 2 accurately reflects a core aspect of CAATSA.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or misleading simplifications of the complex legal framework of CAATSA.


**2. With reference to the India-UK relationship, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" during the 2022 India-UK Virtual Summit.

3.  India is currently the UK's largest trading partner.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership" during the 2021 India-UK Virtual Summit, not 2022.  Statement 2 is incorrect.  The Technology Security Initiative (TSI) focuses on Critical and Emerging Technologies (CET) such as telecom, critical minerals, semiconductors, AI, and quantum technology, not primarily on renewable energy and sustainable agriculture.  Statement 3 is incorrect. India is the UK's 12th largest trading partner, not the largest.  All three statements contain factual inaccuracies, making none of the options correct.


**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat only money laundering and terrorist financing.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2015.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER also assesses measures to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, in addition to money laundering and terrorist financing.  Statement 2 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2015.  Statement 3 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 2002.  All three statements contain factual errors, making none of the options correct.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  Cannabis is the most abused drug globally, according to the UNODC report, not cocaine. Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report has a global scope, not just focusing on Africa.  Statement 3 is correct; the Golden Triangle region, known for drug production, includes Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand and has been renamed the Death Triangle. Thus, only statement 3 is accurate. The other statements present inaccurate information regarding the UNODC reports.


**5. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily focused on enhancing connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Central Asia.
2. The IMEC initiative was formally launched at the 2023 G20 Summit in India.
3.  The IMEC is expected to significantly boost trade and investment flows between participating regions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While IMEC aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, the focus is not exclusively on Central Asia. Statement 2 is incorrect; the provided text doesn't mention a formal launch at the G20 Summit. Statement 3 is correct; the IMEC is expected to boost trade and investment. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 reflect the essence of the IMEC initiative.  The other statements contain inaccuracies or incomplete information about the IMEC's scope and launch.

2.  Belarus became the 9th member of the SCO at the 24th summit.
3. The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and joint military exercises.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the 24th summit is mentioned as being held in Astana, Kazakhstan.  Statement 2 is incorrect; Belarus became the 10th member, not the 9th. Statement 3 is incorrect; while security cooperation is a part of the SCO's agenda, its focus is broader, encompassing economic and cultural cooperation as well.  Therefore, only statement 1 is accurate.  The other statements contain factual errors regarding the SCO's membership and focus.


**7.  With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1.  The G7 has a permanent secretariat and a fixed annual budget.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) aims to mobilize $1 trillion by 2027.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the agenda annually. Statement 2 is incorrect; the PGII aims to mobilize up to $600 billion, not $1 trillion. Statement 3 is correct; India's participation in the 50th G7 summit as an outreach country is mentioned. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other statements contain inaccuracies regarding the G7's structure and the PGII's funding target.


**8. With reference to the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA), consider the following statements:**

1.  AITIGA was signed in 2015.
2.  India has a trade surplus with ASEAN under AITIGA.
3.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting on AITIGA reviewed its progress and future directions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; AITIGA was signed in 2009, not 2015. Statement 2 is incorrect; India has a trade deficit with ASEAN, not a surplus. Statement 3 is correct; the holding of the 5th Joint Committee Meeting is explicitly stated. Therefore, only statement 3 accurately reflects information on AITIGA. The other statements present incorrect information about the agreement's signing date and India's trade balance with ASEAN.


**9. With reference to the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), consider the following statements:**

1.  SAARC decisions are made on the basis of a two-thirds majority vote.
2.  The South Asian Free Trade Area (SAFTA) agreement came into effect in 2005.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; SAARC decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity, not a two-thirds majority. Statement 2 is incorrect; the SAFTA agreement came into effect in 2006, not 2005. Statement 3 is correct; the RBI's announcement of the SAARC Currency Swap Framework is mentioned.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.  The other statements contain errors about decision-making processes and the implementation date of SAFTA.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; NAM's focus is on non-alignment in international relations, not on forming military alliances. Statement 2 is correct; NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US list is explicitly mentioned. Statement 3 is incorrect; NAM includes countries from various continents, not just Africa. Therefore, only statement 2 accurately describes NAM's recent actions. The other statements misrepresent NAM's core principles and membership.


**11. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the smallest member of the Commonwealth in terms of population.
2.  India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2012.
3.  A Commonwealth Sub-Window was established under the India-UN Development Fund.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only

Statement 2 is incorrect; India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, not 2012. Statement 3 is correct; the establishment of a Commonwealth Sub-Window under the India-UN Development Fund is mentioned. Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate. The other statements contain errors regarding India's position in the Commonwealth and the year of the Commonwealth Games hosted by India.


**1. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. The IPEF's Supply Chain Council focuses primarily on enhancing labor rights and workforce development in regional supply chains.
2.  India's election as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council signifies its commitment to strengthening critical supply chains within the Indo-Pacific region.
3. The IPEF Crisis Response Network is designed to facilitate bilateral emergency responses to supply chain disruptions, focusing on individual nation-specific needs.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the IPEF's Supply Chain Council does address labor rights, its primary focus is on strengthening critical supply chains, not solely on labor issues.  The Labor Rights Advisory Board is the specific body dedicated to labor rights and workforce development.  The question attempts to mislead by conflating the roles of different IPEF bodies.

Statement 2 is correct. India's election as Vice-Chair demonstrates its active participation and commitment to collaborating with other IPEF partners to bolster resilient and secure supply chains in the Indo-Pacific. This reflects India's growing geopolitical influence and its strategic interest in regional economic stability.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The IPEF Crisis Response Network is designed for *collective* emergency responses to disruptions, involving multiple partners in coordinated actions, rather than focusing on individual nation-specific solutions. This collaborative approach is crucial for addressing large-scale supply chain crises effectively.  The statement tries to present a narrow, bilateral interpretation of a multilateral initiative.


**2. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. The IMEC is primarily envisioned as a land-based transport corridor, minimizing reliance on maritime routes.
2.  The IMEC's development is anticipated to significantly enhance India's connectivity with Europe, bypassing traditional routes through the Suez Canal.
3. The IMEC initiative is solely focused on improving trade relations between India, the Middle East, and Europe and does not have implications for energy security.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While land routes will likely be part of the IMEC, it's unlikely to exclusively rely on them. A multimodal approach, incorporating maritime and air transport, is more probable for efficiency and resilience. The statement oversimplifies the complexity of a major international infrastructure project.

Statement 2 is correct. The IMEC aims to create alternative routes, potentially reducing reliance on traditional sea lanes and offering quicker and more efficient connectivity between India and Europe, improving trade and transit times.  This diversification of routes enhances strategic autonomy.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  Improved connectivity through the IMEC will have significant implications for energy security by diversifying energy supply routes and potentially facilitating greater energy cooperation between participating regions.  The statement presents an artificially narrow scope for a project with multiple interconnected benefits.


**3. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on counter-terrorism, with minimal emphasis on economic cooperation.
2.  Belarus's accession to the SCO signifies a shift towards increased western influence within the organization.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While counter-terrorism is a key aspect of the SCO's agenda, economic cooperation and regional development are also significant pillars of the organization's activities. The statement presents a skewed perspective, ignoring the multifaceted nature of the SCO.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Belarus's entry into the SCO reflects its alignment with the organization's member states, primarily Russia and China, and doesn't represent a shift towards increased Western influence.  The statement attempts to impose a Western-centric geopolitical narrative on a complex regional dynamic.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 encompasses a broad range of areas, including economic cooperation, security, and cultural exchange, not solely military matters. The statement simplifies the organization's strategic goals, focusing on a single, less prominent aspect.


**4. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 has a permanent, centralized secretariat that manages its operations and sets its annual agenda.
2. The Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII) is primarily focused on infrastructure development within G7 nations.
3. India's participation in the G7 summit as an Outreach Country signifies its growing influence in global economic governance.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the annual agenda. The statement falsely attributes a permanent bureaucratic structure to the G7, which operates on a more flexible, consensus-based model.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The PGII explicitly aims to fund infrastructure projects in *developing* nations, not within the G7 itself. The statement misrepresents the core objective of the PGII, which seeks to counter China's Belt and Road Initiative.

Statement 3 is correct.  India's inclusion as an Outreach Country reflects its growing economic strength, geopolitical importance, and engagement in global forums.  Its participation underscores the increasing recognition of its role in shaping the global economic landscape.


**5. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes cybercrime.
2. India's MER was first adopted in 2024, reflecting the country's recent efforts to strengthen its anti-money laundering framework.
3.  The FATF's peer review process ensures objectivity and transparency in evaluating a country's compliance with international standards on combating financial crime.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the MER focuses on money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, it's an oversimplification to say it *excludes* cybercrime completely.  The evolving nature of financial crime means that aspects related to cybercrime would likely be considered within the broader context of money laundering or terrorist financing schemes.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2024.  The statement provides an incorrect date, which is a common distractor technique in UPSC-style questions.

Statement 3 is correct.  The FATF's peer review process, involving other member states, enhances the objectivity and transparency of its evaluations, ensuring that assessments are based on established international standards and best practices.  This process promotes accountability and encourages countries to improve their anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.



**6. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report indicates that cocaine is the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis.

3. The "Golden Triangle" and "Golden Crescent" regions, now renamed "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent," respectively, remain significant areas for illicit drug production.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 2 and 3
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report indicates that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids. The statement reverses the order of the most abused drugs, creating a plausible but incorrect option.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the report focuses heavily on the illegal trade in endangered species, it is not exclusively limited to them. It addresses a broader range of wildlife crime, including illegal hunting, trafficking, and related activities. The statement narrows down the scope of the report, making it a misleading option.

Statement 3 is correct. The regions, now referred to as "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent," continue to be major sources of illicit drug production and trafficking, highlighting the persistent challenges in combating drug-related crime in these areas.  This statement accurately reflects a key finding of the UNODC report.


**7. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. The BIMSTEC Charter came into force in 2022, immediately after its signing during the 5th summit in Sri Lanka.
2.  Nepal's ratification of the BIMSTEC Charter was the final step in bringing the charter into force.
3.  BIMSTEC's primary focus is on security cooperation, with limited attention to economic and technical collaborations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 2 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While the BIMSTEC Charter was signed and adopted in 2022, it did not come into force immediately. The charter required ratification by all member states before coming into effect. The statement presents an oversimplified timeline.

Statement 2 is correct.  Nepal's ratification was indeed the final step needed to fulfill the requirements for the charter's entry into force.  This highlights the importance of consensus among all member states in BIMSTEC decision-making.

Statement 3 is incorrect. BIMSTEC's focus is on a broad range of areas, including trade, environment, security, agriculture, people-to-people contact, science and technology, and connectivity.  The statement falsely emphasizes security cooperation at the expense of other crucial aspects of the organization's mandate.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Both 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India actually has a trade *deficit* with ASEAN, indicating that its imports from the region exceed its exports.  The statement presents the opposite of the actual trade balance.

Statement 2 is incorrect. AITIGA aims to *reduce* trade barriers, not eliminate them completely.  The statement presents an unrealistic goal of complete barrier removal.

(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect on two counts: Kilimanjaro is in Tanzania, not Kenya, and it is the highest mountain in Africa. Statement 2 is partially correct in its description of Kilimanjaro as a stratovolcano but incorrect in stating that it's part of the East African Rift system; while it's near the Rift, it is not directly part of it. Statement 3 is correct: Uhuru Peak is indeed the highest point on Kilimanjaro.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are partially correct, making (c) the best answer. The other options wrongly include the inaccurate information about the mountain's location and its association with the East African Rift system.  Knowledge of Mount Kilimanjaro's geological features and precise location is essential for understanding its unique ecosystem and the challenges of mountaineering expeditions.

(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

Statement 2 is correct; the pass significantly shortens the pilgrimage route. Statement 3 is also correct;  the pass was closed during the pandemic, and its reopening is a matter of ongoing discussion between India and China (and implicitly Nepal). Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are correct, making (b) the appropriate answer. The other options include the incorrect information regarding the tri-junction countries and the location of the pass.  A strong understanding of the geopolitical significance of the Lipulekh Pass is vital for analyzing India's relations with its neighbors and its access to the Kailash Mansarovar pilgrimage route.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. Bangladesh is indeed India's largest trading partner in South Asia, but India is the *second* largest trading partner of Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest.  Statement 2 is correct; joint military exercises such as Sampriti and Milan are part of the defense cooperation between the two countries. Statement 3 is incorrect; the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports refined petroleum products, primarily High Speed Diesel (HSD), from India to Bangladesh, not crude oil.  Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are partially correct, making (a) the most appropriate answer. The other options wrongly include incorrect information about the nature of trade and the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline's function. A strong understanding of the complexities of India-Bangladesh relations is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of South Asian geopolitics and economic cooperation.

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; while China is India's largest trading partner, India has a significant *trade deficit* with China, not a surplus.  Statement 2 is also incorrect; the LAC is not formally demarcated; it's a disputed line. Statement 3 is correct; the Galwan clash was indeed the deadliest since 1962.  Therefore, only statement 3 is correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.  The other options include the inaccurate information about the trade balance and the nature of the LAC.  A deep understanding of the complexities of India-China relations, including the border disputes and economic ties, is crucial for analyzing the geopolitical landscape of Asia.

(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct. While Nepal's decision is related to the Treaty of Sugauli, the statement is misleading as it implies the Treaty directly justifies Nepal's action – the interpretation of the treaty remains contested. Statement 2 is incorrect; the Kalapani region is a tri-junction area between India, Nepal, and China (Tibet), not Bhutan. Statement 3 is correct; the origin of the Kali River is the central point of disagreement in the Kalapani dispute.  Therefore, only statement 3 is entirely correct, making (b) the appropriate answer.

**1. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction but excludes assessment of measures to combat drug trafficking.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010, and its measures to combat money laundering include the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND) in 2004.
3. The Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal, launched in 2022, facilitates international cooperation in combating financial crimes, but it does not cover information sharing related to tax evasion.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The FATF's MER explicitly assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  While drug trafficking is a significant concern related to financial crime, it's not directly within the core mandate of the FATF's MER in the same way as the other three mentioned.  The FATF does have broader initiatives related to tackling illicit financial flows that could indirectly address drug trafficking financing.

Statement 2 is correct.  India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010. The PMLA, 2002, and the FIU-IND, established in 2004, are key components of India's anti-money laundering framework.  These are accurately reflected in the provided text.

Statement 3 is correct. The MLAT Portal enhances international cooperation in combating financial crimes.  While it doesn't explicitly mention tax evasion, the facilitation of information sharing crucial for investigating and prosecuting money laundering and terrorist financing would indirectly assist in cases where tax evasion is linked to these crimes.  The focus is on cross-border cooperation to track and seize assets related to illicit activities.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day Report indicates that opioids are the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.

3.  The report mentions the legalization of cannabis in Canada, Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions, but it does not address the legal status of cannabis in other countries like Mexico or Portugal.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The UNODC report clearly states that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by other substances.  The order presented in statement 1 is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The report does mention both the "Death Triangle" and the "Death Crescent" as regions significantly impacted by drug-related activities.  The statement incorrectly omits the "Death Crescent."

Statement 3 is correct. The report accurately highlights the legalization of cannabis in Canada, Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions.  It's important to note that the report focuses on specific examples and doesn't aim to provide an exhaustive list of all countries with varying cannabis legalization statuses.


**3. With reference to BIMSTEC, consider the following statements:**

1. BIMSTEC's charter, signed in 2022 during the 5th summit in Sri Lanka, came into force in May 2024 after all member states completed its ratification.  The charter primarily focuses on promoting regional security cooperation, downplaying economic cooperation initiatives.
2. The BIMSTEC Master Plan for Transport Connectivity is a major project under the grouping, but it has faced significant delays due to disagreements among member states regarding funding and route alignment.
3. BIMSTEC's principles include sovereign equality, territorial integrity, and peaceful coexistence, but it does not explicitly address issues related to human rights or democratic governance within member states.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The information regarding the signing and ratification of the BIMSTEC charter and its entry into force is accurate.  However, the statement misrepresents the charter's focus. While regional security is a component, the charter also emphasizes economic cooperation across various sectors.

Statement 2 is partially correct in mentioning the Master Plan. However, the claim about significant delays and disagreements is not explicitly supported by the provided text.  While such challenges are possible within any large-scale regional project, the text doesn't offer evidence to confirm this specific claim.

Statement 3 is correct. The mentioned principles are core tenets of BIMSTEC.  The text does not detail whether human rights or democratic governance are explicitly addressed in the charter or agreements.  This omission, therefore, makes the statement correct as it doesn't claim their inclusion.


**4. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF), consider the following statements:**

1. India was elected Vice-Chair of IPEF’s Supply Chain Council but declined to participate in the Crisis Response Network due to concerns about national sovereignty.
2. The IPEF Supply Chain Agreement established three bodies: a Supply Chain Council, a Crisis Response Network, and a Labor Rights Advisory Board, all of which are equally empowered in decision-making.
3. The IPEF focuses solely on strengthening supply chains and does not address broader economic issues such as digital trade or climate change.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The text mentions India's election as Vice-Chair of the Supply Chain Council but doesn't state anything about its participation or non-participation in the Crisis Response Network.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the three bodies are established, the text doesn't specify their relative power or decision-making structure.  It's inaccurate to assume equal empowerment.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The text only details the supply chain aspect of IPEF.  However, it's highly unlikely that such a major framework would address only supply chains.  It's plausible that other economic issues are covered, but the provided text doesn't explicitly confirm or deny this.  Therefore, the statement is incorrect.


**5. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1.  Belarus's accession as the 10th member of the SCO was unanimously approved at the 24th summit held in Astana, Kazakhstan, but its integration into the SCO's counter-terrorism mechanisms is yet to be finalized.
2. The SCO has adopted a Cooperation Program to Counter Terrorism, Separatism, and Extremism for 2025-2027, but it lacks specific mechanisms for addressing cyberterrorism.
3. The SCO Development Strategy until 2035 prioritizes economic cooperation among member states but gives minimal attention to environmental protection and sustainable development.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct.  The text confirms Belarus's accession.  The statement about the integration into counter-terrorism mechanisms is not explicitly contradicted by the text, and thus is acceptable.

Statement 2 is correct. The text mentions the adoption of the Cooperation Program. The lack of specific mechanisms for cyberterrorism is a plausible assumption given the text's limited information.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While the text highlights the Development Strategy, it does not provide enough information to claim that environmental issues receive minimal attention. This is an assumption not supported by the text.


**6. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. India's participation in the 50th G7 Summit in Italy was as an Outreach Country, signifying a formal membership status in the G7 group.
2. The G7's Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), launched in 2022, aims to fund infrastructure projects in developing nations but excludes projects related to renewable energy.
3. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the agenda annually, making its decision-making process less efficient than other international organizations with permanent secretariats.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's participation as an Outreach Country does *not* signify formal membership.

Statement 3 is correct. The text accurately describes the G7's structure and decision-making process.  The comparison to other organizations is a reasonable observation based on the described structure.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding India's engagement with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) for India, assessing its measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing, was first adopted by FATF in 2005.
2.  India's legislative framework to combat money laundering includes the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, and the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967.  The Directorate of Enforcement (ED) plays a crucial role in its enforcement.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, is primarily responsible for collecting and analyzing financial intelligence related to terrorist financing, but not money laundering.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The MER for India was first adopted in 2010, not 2005.  The FATF conducts periodic reviews, and the date of the initial assessment is a crucial detail.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, and the UAPA, 1967, are indeed key legislative tools used by India to combat money laundering and terrorist financing respectively. The ED is a crucial enforcement agency under these acts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FIU-IND's mandate includes both money laundering and terrorist financing.  Its role in collecting and disseminating financial intelligence is vital for both these crimes.  The statement incorrectly limits its function to only terrorist financing.  Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.


**2. With reference to international conventions related to weapons, consider the following statements:**

1. The Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons, but allows for their use in self-defense.
2. The Chemical Weapons Convention of 1993 bans the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, with a provision for limited exceptions for law enforcement purposes.
3. The Rome Statute of 1998 established the International Criminal Court (ICC) to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, including those involving the use of chemical and biological weapons.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The 1972 Biological Weapons Convention prohibits the development, production, and stockpiling of biological weapons without any exception for self-defense.  The use of biological weapons is strictly forbidden under the convention.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention has no provisions for exceptions for law enforcement. The destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles is a core element of the treaty.

Statement 3 is correct. The Rome Statute of 1998 did establish the ICC with the jurisdiction to prosecute individuals for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide, which can certainly include the use of chemical and biological weapons as elements of these crimes.  Therefore, only statement 3 is accurate.


**3. With reference to the UNODC's reports on drug abuse, consider the following statements:**

1. According to the UNODC's World Drug Day report, opioids are the most abused drugs globally, followed by cannabis.
2. The "Golden Triangle" region, encompassing Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the "Golden Crescent," encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, are significant areas for opium production.
3. Cannabis legalization has been implemented in several US jurisdictions, Uruguay, and Canada, but remains largely prohibited in most parts of the world.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report indicates that cannabis is the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids. The order of prevalence is crucial and is often misremembered.

Statement 2 is correct. Both the Golden Triangle and the Golden Crescent are indeed regions notorious for opium production.  The renaming of these regions as "Death Triangle" and "Death Crescent" highlights the severity of the drug problem.

Statement 3 is correct.  Several US states, Uruguay, and Canada have legalized cannabis, demonstrating a global shift in policy towards this drug, even if it remains illegal in most countries.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are correct.


**4. Consider the following statements about cross-border electricity trade in South Asia:**

1.  India and Bangladesh are developing an electricity corridor from Katihar in Bihar to Bornagar in West Bengal.
2. India is collaborating with Nepal on hydropower projects such as Arun III and Upper Karnali.
3.  The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline facilitates the cross-border trade of electricity between India and Nepal.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The electricity corridor is between Katihar in Bihar and Bornagar in Assam, not West Bengal.  The location of the corridor is a key detail often overlooked.

Statement 2 is correct. India and Nepal are indeed collaborating on hydropower projects, including Arun III and Upper Karnali. This is a significant aspect of regional energy cooperation.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Motihari-Amlekhganj pipeline transports petroleum products, not electricity. Confusing this pipeline with electricity transmission lines is a common error.  Therefore, only statements 2 is correct.


**5. With reference to India's defense agreements with other countries, consider the following statements:**

1. The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) with the US allows for reciprocal logistics support between the two countries' armed forces but excludes the sharing of sensitive technology.
2. The Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) facilitates interoperability between Indian and US military communication systems, including access to encrypted communication systems.
3.  The Basic Exchange and Cooperation Agreement (BECA) allows for the sharing of geospatial intelligence, crucial for navigation and targeting systems, with the US but does not cover other forms of intelligence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While LEMOA facilitates reciprocal logistics support, it doesn't explicitly exclude the sharing of sensitive technology; the level of technology sharing is determined on a case-by-case basis, depending on the sensitivity.

Statement 2 is correct. COMCASA is specifically designed to improve interoperability in communication systems, including secure communication channels.

Statement 3 is partially correct. BECA primarily focuses on geospatial intelligence sharing but the scope of intelligence sharing can extend beyond geospatial. The statement is misleading by suggesting a limitation that doesn't exist.  Therefore, statements 2 and 3 are the most accurate, though statement 3 requires careful interpretation.


**1. Consider the following statements regarding the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

1. The FATF's Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, but excludes other financial crimes.
2.  India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, which includes an on-site visit to assess compliance with international standards.
3.  Among India's measures to combat money laundering are the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), 2002, the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit-India (FIU-IND) in 2004, and the launch of the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) Portal in 2022.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect because the FATF's MER does encompass measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  It's a comprehensive assessment of a country's anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regime.  The statement wrongly limits the scope of the MER.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010 and the process involves a peer review by FATF members, the statement implies a mandatory on-site visit which is not always the case. The methodology can vary depending on the country's risk profile and cooperation. The process is a combination of desk reviews, documentation analysis, and potentially on-site visits.

Statement 3 is correct.  The PMLA, 2002, the FIU-IND (established in 2004), and the MLAT Portal (launched in 2022) are all key components of India's efforts to combat money laundering.  These represent legislative frameworks, institutional mechanisms, and initiatives for international cooperation.  Therefore, this statement accurately reflects India's anti-money laundering measures.


**2. With reference to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports, consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report for 2024 indicates that opioids are the most abused drug globally, followed by cannabis, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report 2024 highlights the Golden Triangle (now renamed the Death Triangle) comprising Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand, and the Golden Crescent (now renamed the Death Crescent) encompassing Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Iran, as regions significantly impacted by drug trafficking.
3. The World Drug Day Report highlights that cannabis legalization has been implemented in Canada, Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions, but not in any European countries.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UNODC report actually indicates that cannabis is the most widely abused drug globally, followed by opioids. The order of prevalence mentioned in statement 1 is inaccurate.

Statement 2 is correct. The UNODC reports indeed highlight the Death Triangle (formerly the Golden Triangle) and Death Crescent (formerly the Golden Crescent) as regions significantly affected by drug trafficking and related criminal activities.  The renaming reflects the severity of the situation.

Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While the statement correctly identifies Canada and Uruguay, and several US jurisdictions as having legalized cannabis, it inaccurately claims that no European countries have legalized it.  Several European countries have implemented some form of cannabis legalization, albeit with varying degrees of regulation.


**3. Consider the following statements about the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB):**

1. Jagjit Pavadia from India has been elected to the INCB for a single term from 2025 to 2030.
2. The INCB is a quasi-judicial body established under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.
3. The INCB's primary function is to monitor and control the international trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While Jagjit Pavadia has been re-elected, the statement incorrectly mentions a single term. He's been re-elected for a *third* term.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Although the INCB is indeed an international monitoring body,  it's not a quasi-judicial body in the sense of having the power to prosecute individuals. Its functions are primarily monitoring, advising, and reporting.  It's established under the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, but its nature is more advisory and supervisory than judicial.

Statement 3 is correct. The INCB's core mandate is to monitor the international trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, ensuring compliance with international conventions and treaties. This includes evaluating national drug control measures and providing technical assistance.


**4. With reference to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (CCPCJ), consider the following statements:**

1. The CCPCJ's 33rd session focused solely on combating cybercrime and data breaches.
2. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative launched at the 33rd session aims to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice through educational programs and awareness campaigns.
3. The UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), 2000 (Palermo Convention), is a key mechanism to tackle transnational organized crime (TOC), and India is a signatory to the convention.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 and 3 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 2 only


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While combating transnational organized crime was a key focus of the 33rd session, the statement wrongly restricts the focus to only cybercrime and data breaches.  The session addressed a broader range of crime prevention and criminal justice issues.

Statement 2 is correct. The Generation Justice (GenJust) initiative was indeed launched to engage youth in crime prevention and criminal justice.  The initiative aims to empower young people to participate actively in these efforts.

Statement 3 is correct. The UNTOC, 2000 (Palermo Convention) is a crucial international instrument for combating transnational organized crime, and India is indeed a signatory.  The statement accurately reflects the importance of this convention in the fight against TOC.


**5. Consider the following statements about the ASEAN-India Trade in Goods Agreement (AITIGA):**

1. AITIGA was signed in 2009 with the objective of eliminating all trade barriers between ASEAN member states and India.
2. The 5th Joint Committee Meeting of AITIGA reviewed the agreement's progress and identified new areas for cooperation, including the expansion of digital trade.
3. India consistently maintains a trade surplus with ASEAN under AITIGA.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. AITIGA aims to *reduce* trade barriers, not eliminate them entirely.  The agreement involves a phased approach to liberalization, with some tariffs and non-tariff barriers remaining.

Statement 2 is correct.  The 5th Joint Committee Meeting did review the agreement's progress and explored avenues for enhancing cooperation.  While the text doesn't specifically mention "expansion of digital trade,"  this is a logical area of focus for modern trade agreements.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  The provided text explicitly states that India has a *trade deficit* with ASEAN.  This indicates that India imports more from ASEAN than it exports to the region.


**1. With reference to the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), consider the following statements:**

1. CAATSA was enacted in 2017 primarily to impose sanctions on countries engaging with North Korea and Iran.
2.  The US House of Representatives passed an amendment in 2018 exempting India from CAATSA sanctions for its purchase of the S-400 missile defense system from Russia.
3. CAATSA sanctions primarily target countries' energy sectors, irrespective of their level of engagement with sanctioned entities.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

CAATSA, enacted in 2017, aims to counter adversaries like Russia, North Korea, and Iran through economic sanctions.  Statement 1 is partially correct; while it targets these countries, its scope also includes Russia. Statement 2 is accurate; a 2018 amendment did provide an exemption for India regarding the S-400 purchase.  Statement 3 is incorrect. CAATSA's sanctions are not limited to the energy sector and are applied based on the extent and nature of engagement with sanctioned entities.  The sanctions can impact various aspects of a country's economy and its dealings with the US. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 accurately reflect aspects of CAATSA.


**2. With reference to India-UK relations, consider the following statements:**

1. The India-UK relationship was elevated to a "Strategic Partnership" during the virtual summit in 2021.
2.  The "Technology Security Initiative (TSI)" focuses primarily on cooperation in the fields of telecommunications, critical minerals, and artificial intelligence.
3.  India is currently the UK's fifth-largest trading partner.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

The India-UK relationship was elevated to a "Comprehensive Strategic Partnership (CSP)" in 2021, not just a "Strategic Partnership," making statement 1 partially incorrect. Statement 2 is largely accurate; the TSI does indeed cover telecommunications, critical minerals, and AI, among other critical and emerging technologies. However, the description is not exhaustive. Statement 3 is incorrect; India is the UK's 12th largest trading partner, not the fifth. Therefore, only statements 1 (with correction) and 2 are largely correct.



**3. With reference to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), consider the following statements:**

1. The Mutual Evaluation Report (MER) assesses a country's measures to combat money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes the purpose of the FATF's MER. Statement 2 is incorrect; India's first MER was adopted in 2010, not 2000.  Statement 3 is also incorrect; the FATF is an intergovernmental organization, not a subsidiary of the United Nations. It is an independent body working to combat money laundering and terrorist financing globally.  Only statement 1 is entirely accurate.



**4. With reference to the UNODC's World Drug Day Report, consider the following statements:**

1. The report identifies opioids as the most abused drug globally.
2. The "Golden Triangle" region, now renamed the "Death Triangle," comprises Laos, Myanmar, and Thailand.
3. Cannabis legalization is currently widespread across the African continent.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; cannabis is identified as the most abused drug, not opioids. Statement 2 is correct; the report does rename the "Golden Triangle" as the "Death Triangle" and identifies the correct countries. Statement 3 is incorrect; cannabis legalization is not widespread in Africa, but it is in some US jurisdictions, Canada, and Uruguay. Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely accurate.



**5. With reference to the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA), consider the following statements:**

1. AFSPA grants special powers to armed forces only in areas declared "disturbed" by the central government.
2.  The Act provides complete immunity to armed forces personnel from any legal proceedings.
3. AFSPA is currently in effect in parts of Jammu and Kashmir, Assam, Manipur, and Nagaland.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; while the Act applies to disturbed areas, the declaration can be made by the Governor, administrator of a UT or the Centre.  Statement 2 is incorrect;  while the Act provides for certain immunities, it doesn't grant complete immunity from all legal proceedings.  Legal proceedings can be initiated with prior sanction from the Central Government. Statement 3 is correct regarding its current applicability.  Therefore, only statements 1 (with correction) and 3 are largely correct.


**6. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia.
2.  The "Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant" is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh.

(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially correct; the Commonwealth promotes cooperation on various fronts, not solely focused on politics.  Statement 2 is correct; the Head of the Commonwealth is chosen by member states. Statement 3 is incorrect; India hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2010, not 2000.  Therefore, only statement 2 is fully accurate.

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect; the BIMSTEC Charter came into force on May 20, 2024, not 2022. Statement 2 is partially correct; while economic cooperation is a significant aspect, BIMSTEC addresses other areas like security and environment. Statement 3 is correct; the charter's ratification was completed before it came into force.  Therefore, only statements 2 (with correction) and 3 are largely correct.



**9. With reference to the Quad, consider the following statements:**

1. The Quad Leaders' Summit in Wilmington adopted the "Wilmington Declaration."

(d) 1, 2, and 3


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct; the Wilmington Declaration was indeed adopted. Statement 2 is incorrect; the "Quad Cancer Moonshot" aims to combat cervical cancer, not exclusively breast cancer. Statement 3 is partially correct; while countering China's influence is a significant factor, the Quad's aims are broader than that. Therefore, only statements 1 and 3 (with correction) are largely correct.


**10. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  India has a trade deficit with the United States.
2.  The Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement (LEMOA) was signed in 2018.

Statement 2 is accurate in stating that the United States forms the entirety of Mexico's northern land border.  Finally, Statement 3 is also correct, specifying Belize and Guatemala as the countries sharing a land border with Mexico to the southeast.  There are no inaccuracies or misleading elements in these statements; they represent established geographical facts.  Options (a), (b), and (d) are incorrect because they omit at least one of the accurate statements.  Understanding a country's geographical context is crucial for UPSC, as it often forms the basis for geopolitical analysis and understanding international relations.


**2. With reference to Bolivia's geography and current economic situation, consider the following statements:**

1. Bolivia's western border is entirely shared with Chile, extending along the Andes Mountains.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is partially incorrect. While Bolivia does share a significant western border with Chile, it's not entirely along the Andes.  A portion of its western border also touches Peru. Statement 2 is correct; Bolivia's economic challenges are indeed linked to its dependence on the US dollar and rising debt levels. Statement 3 is also correct; the listed countries – Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina, and Peru – all share land borders with Bolivia.  Therefore, only statements 2 and 3 are entirely accurate.  Understanding the economic vulnerabilities of nations, alongside their geographical positioning, is key to comprehending global economic dynamics – a crucial area for UPSC aspirants.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 accurately describes Trinidad and Tobago's location in the southeastern West Indies, near Venezuela. Statement 2 is also correct; the adoption of UPI is indeed a significant technological milestone for the Caribbean.  However, Statement 3 is incorrect. Trinidad and Tobago is an island nation and does not share a land border with any country, including Guyana. Its proximity to Guyana is maritime, not terrestrial. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are completely accurate.  Understanding the geographical context of nations and their adoption of new technologies, especially in the context of global interconnectedness, is important for UPSC. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect because they either omit correct statements or include the false statement 3.

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 correctly describes New Zealand's geographical location in the South Pacific Ocean, between the Tropic of Capricorn and the Antarctic Circle.  Statement 2 accurately reflects the diplomatic recognition given to India.  However, Statement 3 is partially incorrect. While New Zealand does include North Island and South Island, Stewart Island is considered a smaller, separate island, not one of the main two. Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.  Understanding a country's geography and its diplomatic relations with other nations is crucial for UPSC preparation, particularly in the context of international relations and strategic studies. Options (b), (c), and (d) are incorrect, either omitting correct statements or including the partially false statement 3.

(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The LAC is a disputed border, and there is no formally demarcated and mutually agreed-upon line.  The lack of a formally defined boundary is a major source of tension between the two countries.  Both sides have differing interpretations of the LAC's location, leading to frequent border disputes.

Statement 2 is incorrect. China's claims in the Western Sector are based on the McDonald Line of 1899, not the Johnson Line. The Johnson Line is the Indian claim in that sector.  The discrepancy between these lines is a significant point of contention.

Statement 3 is correct. The Galwan clash of 2020 resulted in significant casualties on both sides and marked a significant escalation in the border tensions.  This incident stands as the most serious border confrontation since the 1962 Sino-Indian War.

Statement 2 is correct. The Lipulekh Pass is strategically located near the tri-junction of India, China (Tibet), and Nepal, and falls within Uttarakhand's Pithorgarh district. This pass holds significant geopolitical importance.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Suez Canal connects the Mediterranean and Red Seas, but it's the shortest maritime route between Asia and *Europe*, not Africa.  The proximity to Europe is crucial for global trade and shipping.


**1. With reference to the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), consider the following statements:**

1. The PGII was launched in 2021 with the primary aim of mobilizing $500 billion by 2025 for infrastructure projects in developing countries.

(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The PGII was launched in 2022, aiming to mobilize up to $600 billion by 2027, not $500 billion by 2025.  The timeframe and target funding amount are both inaccurate.  The initiative's scope is broader than just developing countries, encompassing a wider range of nations.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the PGII emphasizes sustainable infrastructure, its focus is not exclusively on renewable energy projects.  It aims for sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality infrastructure across various sectors, including transportation, energy (both renewable and conventional), digital infrastructure, and more.  Limiting its scope to only renewable energy is a significant oversimplification.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The PGII is not solely funded by G7 nations.  It aims to mobilize funding from a variety of sources, including public and private sector actors, multilateral development banks, and other international financial institutions. This collaborative approach is crucial to its success and achieving its ambitious funding goals.  Attributing funding solely to G7 nations ignores the diverse and crucial partnerships involved.


**2. With reference to the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), consider the following statements:**

1.  NAM's current membership consists exclusively of countries from the African continent.
2.  The primary goal of NAM is to promote military alliances among its member states to enhance regional security.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. NAM comprises a diverse membership base, extending far beyond the African continent.  It includes countries from Asia, Latin America, and other regions across the globe.  To restrict its membership to only Africa is a gross misrepresentation of its global reach and influence.

Statement 2 is incorrect. NAM's core principle is non-alignment, meaning it avoids forming military alliances with major power blocs.  Its focus is on promoting peace, cooperation, and mutual respect among nations, not military alliances.  Attributing a military alliance objective to NAM contradicts its fundamental ethos.

Statement 3 is correct.  The news clearly highlights NAM's call for Cuba's removal from the US's unilateral list of 'State Sponsors of Terrorism'. This demonstrates NAM's engagement in global political issues and its advocacy for its member states' interests within the international system.  This accurately reflects NAM's role in advocating for the Global South.



**3. With reference to the Commonwealth, consider the following statements:**

1.  The Commonwealth is primarily a military alliance, focused on collective defense among its member states.
2.  India's contribution to the Commonwealth budget is the highest among all member nations.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Commonwealth is an intergovernmental organization focused on political cooperation, economic development, and social progress among its member states.  It does not function as a military alliance.  This statement fundamentally misrepresents the Commonwealth's nature and purpose.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  While India is a significant contributor, representing nearly 60% of the Commonwealth's population and being the fourth largest contributor financially, it is not the largest contributor to the Commonwealth budget.  This statement confuses India's population influence with its financial contribution.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Commonwealth Sub Window established under the India-UN Development Fund allocated $50 million, not $100 million, over a five-year period. The funding amount is misstated.  This displays a lack of precise information about the financial allocation.



**4. With reference to the IAEA's key programmes, consider the following statements:**

1. The Incident and Trafficking Database (ITDB) exclusively monitors nuclear material theft within the member states of the European Union.
2. The Atoms4Food programme utilizes nuclear technology solely for enhancing crop yields through genetic modification.

(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The ITDB monitors illicit nuclear trafficking globally, not just within the European Union.  The scope of the database is worldwide, encompassing a much broader geographical area than stated.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The Atoms4Food program utilizes nuclear techniques for various applications in improving food security, which is not limited to genetic modification of crops. It encompasses a wide range of applications in agriculture, including pest control, improving soil health, and enhancing food safety.  The statement oversimplifies the program's broad application.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Zoonotic Disease Integrated Action program explicitly utilizes nuclear science and technology in managing and combating zoonotic diseases.  This statement mistakenly asserts a lack of nuclear technology application when it is a crucial element of the program.


**5. With reference to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU)'s Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI) 2024, consider the following statements:**

1. The GCI 2024 assesses cybersecurity commitments at the individual citizen level rather than at the national level.

3. India is categorized as a Tier 2 country in the GCI 2024, indicating a moderate level of cybersecurity commitment.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The GCI 2024 assesses country-level cybersecurity commitments, not individual citizen-level.  The scale of assessment is at the national level, not the individual level.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The GCI 2024 includes 46 countries categorized as "role modelling" (Tier 1), and this group is not limited to G7 nations.  The statement incorrectly restricts the "role modelling" countries to only the G7.

Statement 3 is incorrect. India is classified as a Tier 1 country ("role modelling") in the GCI 2024, demonstrating a strong commitment to cybersecurity.  The statement incorrectly places India in a lower tier, misrepresenting its ranking.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 2 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The IMEC explicitly includes the Middle East as a crucial component of its economic corridor.  Excluding the Middle East misrepresents the corridor's geographical scope.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The IMEC is an economic initiative focused on trade, investment, and infrastructure development.  It has no military objectives.  Assigning military aims to the IMEC is a complete mischaracterization.

Statement 3 is correct. The news explicitly mentions the IMEC's role in enhancing global connectivity, showcasing its importance in streamlining trade and transportation routes.  This accurately reflects the corridor's intended impact on global connectivity.


**7. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's membership is limited to countries located solely within the geographical boundaries of Central Asia.
2. Belarus's recent accession to the SCO marks its expansion into Eastern Europe.

(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The SCO's membership includes countries from Central Asia, but also extends to other regions of Asia and beyond.  Restricting its membership solely to Central Asia is a major inaccuracy.

Statement 2 is correct. Belarus's accession to the SCO represents the organization's expansion into Eastern Europe, marking a significant geopolitical development.  This accurately reflects the geopolitical implications of Belarus's membership.

Statement 3 is incorrect.  While economic cooperation is a significant aspect of the SCO's activities, it also addresses security concerns, including counter-terrorism and regional stability.  The statement misrepresents the SCO's multifaceted approach to regional cooperation.  Ignoring the security aspects of SCO is a significant oversight.


**8. With reference to the Group of Seven (G7), consider the following statements:**

1. The G7 operates under a fixed, permanent organizational structure with a centralized secretariat.
2.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is not associated with the G7.

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The G7 lacks a permanent structure; its rotating Presidency sets the agenda annually.  The statement incorrectly posits a fixed structure.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  The "Energy for Growth in Africa" initiative is explicitly mentioned as a G7-led effort.  The statement wrongly denies the G7's involvement.

Statement 3 is correct. The G7 Future of the Seas and Oceans Initiative (FSOI) is listed among the G7 initiatives.  This accurately reflects the G7's focus on global issues.


**9. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Agreement, consider the following statements:**

1. India is the chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.
2. The Crisis Response Network is one of the three bodies established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India was elected Vice-Chair, not the Chair, of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council.  The statement misrepresents India's role within the council.

Statement 2 is correct. The Crisis Response Network is one of the three bodies explicitly mentioned as being established under the IPEF's Supply Chain Agreement.  This accurately reflects the structure of the IPEF's agreement.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Labor Rights Advisory Board's scope extends beyond the textile industry to encompass broader labor rights and workforce development across all regional supply chains.  The statement incorrectly limits the board's focus.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. India's MER was first adopted in 2010, not 2000.  The year of adoption is misstated.

Statement 2 is correct. The PMLA, 2002, is one of the legislative frameworks used by India to combat money laundering and is explicitly mentioned in the text.  This statement accurately reflects India's legal framework.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FIU-IND was established in 2004, not 1956.  The establishment year is inaccurate.  The statement confuses the FIU-IND with another institution.


**1. Consider the following statements about the Financial Action Task Force (FATF):**

2. India's MER was first adopted in 2010 and subsequently updated in 2024, reflecting improvements in its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing frameworks.
3. The Financial Intelligence Unit of India (FIU-IND), established in 2004, plays a crucial role in collecting, analyzing, and disseminating financial intelligence to combat financial crimes, but does not coordinate with international counterparts.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  The FATF's MER comprehensively assesses a country's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While cybercrime is a growing concern, it's not explicitly excluded from the scope of the MER, although related aspects might be covered under broader categories.

Statement 2 is correct. India's MER was indeed first adopted in 2010.  The subsequent updates reflect India's ongoing efforts to strengthen its anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing mechanisms.  The continuous evaluation and updates are a crucial component of the FATF process.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The FIU-IND is vital in India's fight against financial crime. However, it actively collaborates with international counterparts through information sharing and participation in global networks to combat transnational financial crimes.  This international cooperation is essential for effective enforcement.  The statement misrepresents the FIU-IND's role and reach.


**2. With reference to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), consider the following statements:**

1. The UNODC's World Drug Day report identifies cannabis as the most abused drug globally, followed by opioids, amphetamines, cocaine, and ecstasy, and highlights the "Death Triangle" region as a primary concern.
2. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report, released in 2024, focuses solely on illegal wildlife trade and does not address the link between wildlife crime and transnational organized crime.
3. The UNODC acts as the secretariat for the UN Convention Against Transnational Organized Crime (UNTOC), facilitating international cooperation in combating organized crime but excludes regional initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 1 and 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is largely correct. The UNODC's World Drug Day report consistently highlights cannabis as the most widely abused drug. The report also focuses on regions significantly affected by drug trafficking, including the "Golden Triangle" (renamed "Death Triangle"), emphasizing the transnational nature of the drug trade.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The UNODC's World Wildlife Crime Report examines the illegal wildlife trade but also acknowledges the strong connections between wildlife crime and transnational organized crime networks, recognizing the overlap in criminal activities and methods. The report often analyzes the links between these criminal enterprises.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The UNODC does serve as the secretariat for UNTOC, playing a central role in coordinating international efforts to combat transnational organized crime.  Furthermore, the UNODC actively supports and collaborates with various regional initiatives aimed at strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice responses.  The statement incorrectly limits the UNODC's role.

2. The India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC) aims to enhance connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, primarily through maritime routes and bypassing land-based transit routes.
3. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) has recently admitted Belarus as its tenth member, significantly expanding the organization's geographical reach and strategic influence.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India's engagement with IPEF is multifaceted, encompassing the "Clean Economy," "Fair Economy," and the overarching IPEF agreement.  It actively participates in initiatives across all pillars, including those related to supply chain resilience and fair trade practices. The statement oversimplifies India's comprehensive IPEF involvement.

Statement 2 is incorrect. While the IMEC prioritizes connectivity between India, the Middle East, and Europe, it will likely utilize a combination of maritime and land-based transport networks to optimize efficiency and reach.  The statement inaccurately restricts the IMEC's approach to solely maritime routes.

Statement 3 is correct. Belarus's admission to the SCO is a significant development, expanding the organization's geographic scope and influencing its strategic dynamics within the Eurasian region.  The statement accurately reflects this recent addition to the SCO membership.


**4. With reference to global initiatives to counter terrorism, consider the following statements:**

1. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy primarily focuses on national-level counter-terrorism efforts, with limited emphasis on regional or international cooperation.
2. The UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund, established in 2009, supports programs such as Countering Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and Countering Terrorist Travel Programme (CTTP), but excludes initiatives related to cybersecurity.
3. India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund in 2022 primarily supported UNOCT's global programs focusing on CFT and CTTP, demonstrating India's commitment to international counter-terrorism efforts.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 2 only
(d) 2 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The UN Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy explicitly emphasizes the need for enhanced cooperation at the national, regional, and international levels to effectively address the multifaceted challenges of terrorism.  The statement incorrectly downplays the strategy's focus on collaborative efforts.

Statement 2 is partially incorrect. While the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund does support CFT and CTTP, it is not accurate to say it excludes cybersecurity initiatives entirely.  The fund's scope is broad, and cybersecurity-related aspects might be included within broader counter-terrorism programs.  The statement is too definitive in its exclusion.

Statement 3 is correct. India's contribution to the UN Counter-Terrorism Trust Fund in 2022 specifically aided UNOCT's programs related to CFT and CTTP.  This action demonstrates India's active participation in global counter-terrorism initiatives and its commitment to international cooperation in this crucial area.


**1. With reference to multilateral peace operations, consider the following statements:**

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  India, not Brazil, was the highest contributor of military personnel for UN peacekeeping forces in 2023, according to the SIPRI report.  Brazil's contribution, while significant in its own right, did not surpass India's. This highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of global peacekeeping efforts and the differing levels of commitment from various nations.  The question aims to test the candidate's knowledge of specific details and their ability to discern accurate information from potentially misleading options.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The largest deployment of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa, not East Asia. This demonstrates the continuing need for peacekeeping operations in regions facing significant conflict and instability.  The question tests the candidate's awareness of geographical distribution of peacekeeping efforts and the challenges posed by differing regional conflicts.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The SIPRI report did not indicate a decrease in the number of peacekeeping missions globally; rather, it focused on developments and trends within existing missions.  The inclusion of this statement serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's ability to differentiate between a general decline in peacekeeping activity and the specifics of the SIPRI report's findings.  The overall difficulty is heightened by the requirement to recall precise details from a specific report, rather than relying on general knowledge.


**2. With reference to India's military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1.  Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise held annually between India and the United Kingdom.
2.  Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint naval exercise between India and the United States.
3.  Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and Russia, held in Mumbai.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise between India and the United States, not the United Kingdom. The exercise focuses on enhancing interoperability and tactical cooperation between the two armed forces.  The incorrect information serves as a distractor, testing whether the candidate can accurately recall the participating countries in specific exercises.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint army exercise between India and the United States, not a naval exercise.  The confusion between army and naval exercises is a common pitfall, designed to challenge the candidate's precise understanding of the nature of these military collaborations.

Statement 3 is incorrect. Exercise Tarkash is a joint Indo-U.S. counter-terrorism exercise, not between India and Russia, and it was held in Kolkata, not Mumbai.  The incorrect information about the participating country and location serves as a significant distractor, requiring the candidate to possess detailed knowledge of the exercise's specifics.  This question tests detailed recall of facts related to specific military exercises involving India.


**3. With reference to the Andaman and Nicobar Command, consider the following statements:**

1.  It is a single-service command under the Indian Navy.
2.  It is responsible for the security of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and the surrounding waters.
3.  The Strategic Forces Command is also a tri-services command.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is a tri-services command, not a single-service command under the Indian Navy. It integrates the Army, Navy, and Air Force for the comprehensive security of the islands.  The mischaracterization of the command's structure aims to test the candidate's understanding of the unique organizational aspects of India's defense establishment.

Statement 2 is correct. The Andaman and Nicobar Command is indeed responsible for the security of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands and their surrounding maritime areas.  This is a straightforward factual statement, which contrasts with the more complex and potentially misleading information provided in the other options.

Statement 3 is correct. The Strategic Forces Command, responsible for India's nuclear arsenal, is also a tri-services command.  This statement further tests the candidate's knowledge of the organizational structure of India's defense forces and the roles of different commands.  The correct answer highlights the importance of understanding the integrated nature of India's defense structure.


**4. With reference to the National Security Council (NSC) of India, consider the following statements:**

1. The NSC is a constitutional body established under the Constitution of India.
2. The National Security Advisor (NSA) reports directly to the President of India.
3. The NSC Secretariat (NSCS) is responsible for coordinating the work of the NSC and its subsidiary bodies.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only


**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The NSC is not a constitutional body; it was established by an executive order in 1998.  This tests the candidate's understanding of the legal basis of the NSC's authority and its relationship to the Indian Constitution.

Statement 2 is incorrect. The NSA reports directly to the Prime Minister, not the President of India.  This statement highlights the importance of understanding the chain of command within India's national security apparatus.

Statement 3 is correct. The NSCS plays a crucial role in coordinating the work of the NSC and its subsidiary bodies.  This is a straightforward factual statement that contrasts with the more nuanced and potentially misleading information in the other options. The question tests knowledge of the organizational structure and functioning of the NSC.


**5. With reference to Operation Vijay, consider the following statements:**

1. Operation Vijay was launched by the Indian Air Force to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants who infiltrated the Kargil district of Jammu and Kashmir.
2. Operation Safed Sagar was a naval operation conducted to blockade Pakistan’s navy in the Arabian Sea.
3.  Key locations during Operation Vijay included Tololing, Tiger Hill, and Siachen Glacier.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. Operation Vijay was launched by the Indian Army, not the Indian Air Force, to evict Pakistani soldiers and militants from the Kargil sector.  The incorrect attribution of the operation to the Air Force serves as a distractor, testing the candidate's understanding of the roles of different branches of the Indian military.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Operation Safed Sagar was an air operation, conducted by the Indian Air Force to target Pakistani troops on high-altitude positions, not a naval operation.  The confusion between air and naval operations is a common pitfall designed to challenge the candidate's precise understanding of the military actions during the Kargil War.

Statement 3 is incorrect. While Tololing and Tiger Hill were indeed key locations, Siachen Glacier was not directly involved in the Kargil conflict.  The inclusion of Siachen serves as a distractor, relying on the candidate's general knowledge of high-altitude conflicts to mislead them. The question tests detailed knowledge of the Kargil War and related military operations.



**1. Consider the following statements about India's military contributions:**

1. India was the largest contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping forces in 2023.
2. The majority of UN peacekeeping forces in 2023 were deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa.
3.  SIPRI's report on multilateral peace operations in 2023 highlighted India's significant role in UN peacekeeping but did not specify its ranking among all contributors.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) Both 1 and 2
(d) Neither 1 nor 2

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While India is a significant contributor of military personnel to UN peacekeeping missions, the provided text states that India was the *highest* contributor in 2023. This is a subtle but important distinction.  The  "highest" doesn't automatically imply "largest," as the 'largest' would require a comparison of the total number of troops contributed by all countries. The text doesn't give this full data. Hence, we cannot definitively say that India contributed the largest number of troops.

Statement 2 is correct. The text explicitly mentions that the largest deployment of peacekeeping forces in 2023 was in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Statement 3 is partially correct. SIPRI's report did discuss India's role in UN peacekeeping, but the exact ranking among all contributors is not mentioned in the given text.  It highlights India's contribution, but doesn't quantify its position relative to other nations.

Therefore, only statement 2 is definitively correct based on the provided information.


**2. With reference to India's bilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise held annually between India and the USA, primarily focused on naval operations.
2. Exercise Vajra Prahar is a joint air exercise between India and the USA, conducted in the Mediterranean Sea.
3. Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the USA, recently held in Kolkata.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) 1 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. While Exercise Yudh Abhyas is a joint military exercise between India and the USA, it is not primarily focused on naval operations; it's a broader joint military exercise.

Statement 2 is incorrect. Exercise Vajra Prahar is an army exercise, not an air exercise, between India and the USA.  Additionally, it is not conducted in the Mediterranean Sea; the text doesn't specify the location.

Statement 3 is correct. The text explicitly states that Exercise Tarkash is a joint counter-terrorism exercise between India and the USA, recently held in Kolkata.

Therefore, only statement 3 is correct based on the provided information.


**3. With reference to India's multilateral military exercises, consider the following statements:**

1. IBSAMAR VIII is a joint maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa, held annually in the Indian Ocean.
2. Exercise Malabar is an annual maritime exercise involving Australia, Japan, the United States, and India, primarily focused on air power projection.
3. Exercise RIMPAC is the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India is a regular participant.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 3 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (c)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect.  While IBSAMAR VIII is a joint maritime exercise involving India, Brazil, and South Africa, the provided text does not state it's held annually in the Indian Ocean.  The frequency and specific location are not specified.

Statement 2 is incorrect.  Exercise Malabar is a maritime exercise, but its primary focus is not air power projection; it's a broader maritime exercise.

Statement 3 is correct. The text clearly states that Exercise RIMPAC is the world's largest international multilateral maritime exercise, and India participates.

Therefore, only statement 3 is completely accurate based on the provided information.


**4. With reference to India's engagement with Chabahar Port, consider the following statements:**

1. India, Iran, and Afghanistan signed a tripartite agreement in 2016 to develop the Shahid Beheshti Terminal at Chabahar Port, primarily to enhance trade with Central Asian countries.
2. The Chabahar Port is strategically located on the Gulf of Oman, providing a direct sea route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan and offering an alternative route to the Suez Canal.
3.  A recent 10-year agreement between India and Iran for the development of the Shahid Beheshti Port Terminal at Chabahar Port aims to reduce India's reliance on the INSTC for trade with Central Asia.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2 and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is correct. The text confirms the tripartite agreement in 2016 and that the port development aims to improve trade links with Afghanistan and, by extension, Central Asia.

Statement 2 is correct. The text highlights Chabahar's strategic location on the Gulf of Oman and its significance in providing an alternative route to Afghanistan, bypassing Pakistan, and serving as a potential alternative to the Suez Canal route, aligning with the INSTC initiative.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The 10-year agreement doesn't aim to *reduce* India's reliance on the INSTC; rather, the Chabahar Port development complements the INSTC initiative by providing another route to Central Asia.  The two initiatives work in tandem, not in competition.

Therefore, only statements 1 and 2 are entirely correct.


**5.  With reference to the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC), consider the following statements:**

1. The INSTC is a multimodal transport corridor connecting Mumbai to St. Petersburg, primarily utilizing sea routes through the Suez Canal.
2. The INSTC is a multilateral initiative involving India, Iran, and Russia, with the aim of creating an alternative trade route to Europe, bypassing the Suez Canal.
3. The Chabahar Port development is a separate initiative unrelated to the INSTC's goals of enhancing connectivity between India and Europe.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 1 and 3 only
(d) 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Statement 1 is incorrect. The INSTC connects Mumbai to St. Petersburg, but it's a multimodal corridor (using land and sea routes) and doesn't primarily rely on the Suez Canal. It aims to provide an *alternative* to the Suez Canal route.

Statement 2 is correct. The INSTC is a multilateral initiative involving India, Iran, and Russia (and other countries) aiming to establish an alternative route to Europe, bypassing the Suez Canal.

Statement 3 is incorrect. The Chabahar Port development is directly related to the INSTC's goals.  The port serves as a crucial node within the INSTC network, facilitating connectivity between India and Central Asia, thereby supporting the INSTC's broader objective.

Therefore, only statement 2 is entirely correct.


**1. With reference to the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor (IMEC), consider the following statements:**

1. IMEC is primarily a bilateral initiative between India and the European Union.
2.  The IMEC's primary objective is to reduce transportation costs between India and Europe by leveraging existing infrastructure.
3. IMEC aims to enhance regional cooperation for efforts to curb terrorism, separatism, and extremism in the Middle East.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely correct.  Statement 1 is incorrect because IMEC is a multilateral initiative, not solely bilateral between India and the EU. It involves multiple countries across the Middle East and Europe to create a comprehensive trade and transportation corridor. Statement 2 is partially correct in that it aims to improve connectivity and reduce transportation time, but this is not its *primary* objective.  The overarching goal is to boost economic cooperation and create a robust trade route.  Statement 3 is incorrect; IMEC focuses on economic development and trade, not primarily on counter-terrorism efforts. While regional stability is indirectly beneficial, the core objective is economic growth and integration.  The corridor's success hinges on facilitating trade and investment, fostering economic growth, and creating new opportunities for regional cooperation.


**2. With reference to the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), consider the following statements:**

1. The SCO's primary focus is on military alliances and collective defense among its member states.
2.  Belarus's recent accession to the SCO signifies a shift towards increased military cooperation within the organization.
3. The SCO's Development Strategy until 2035 primarily focuses on economic development and trade liberalization among its members.


Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

None of the statements are entirely accurate. Statement 1 is incorrect because while security cooperation is a significant aspect of the SCO, its mandate extends beyond purely military alliances. It encompasses political, economic, and cultural cooperation. Statement 2 is misleading; while Belarus's entry expands the SCO's membership, it doesn't automatically imply a significant shift towards increased military cooperation.  The SCO's focus remains multifaceted. Statement 3 is partially true; economic cooperation is an important component of the SCO's strategy, but it is not the *primary* focus.  The strategy encompasses various sectors, including security, culture, and sustainable development. The SCO is a complex organization with diverse objectives, making it inaccurate to focus on any one singular aspect.


**3. With reference to the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF)'s Supply Chain Council, consider the following statements:**

1. The Supply Chain Council is solely focused on resolving immediate supply chain disruptions.
2. The Crisis Response Network under IPEF is responsible for enhancing labor rights and workforce development.
3. India's role as Vice-Chair of the IPEF's Supply Chain Council is primarily focused on trade negotiations and tariff reductions.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is wrong because the Supply Chain Council's mandate is broader than just immediate crisis management. It aims to strengthen supply chains in the long term through diversification, resilience building, and collaborative initiatives. Statement 2 is inaccurate; the Labor Rights Advisory Board under IPEF addresses labor rights and workforce development, not the Crisis Response Network. The Crisis Response Network focuses on coordinating emergency responses to disruptions. Statement 3 misrepresents India's role. While trade is a component of IPEF, India's Vice-Chairmanship focuses on broader supply chain resilience, not solely trade negotiations.  The Council's work includes promoting diversification, enhancing transparency, and fostering collaboration among member countries to build more resilient and secure supply chains.


**4. With reference to India-Bangladesh relations, consider the following statements:**

1.  Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner globally, and India is Bangladesh's largest trading partner in Asia.
2. The India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline primarily transports crude oil from India to Bangladesh.
3. The 'Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant' is a joint venture between India and Bangladesh, primarily powered by renewable energy sources.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is partially correct in that Bangladesh is India's largest trading partner in South Asia, but not globally. India's largest trading partners are much larger economies.  India is also the second-largest trading partner for Bangladesh in Asia, not the largest. Statement 2 is wrong; the India-Bangladesh Friendship Pipeline transports high-speed diesel, not crude oil.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the Maitree Super Thermal Power Plant is a coal-fired power plant, not primarily powered by renewable energy sources.  The relationship between India and Bangladesh is complex and involves multiple sectors, including energy, trade, and infrastructure.  Understanding the specifics of these initiatives requires detailed knowledge of the agreements and projects.


**5. With reference to India-Maldives relations, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect or misleading. Statement 1 is incorrect; while security is a component, the partnership encompasses economic and development cooperation as well. The focus is broader than just military collaboration. Statement 2 is partially correct in that it aims to provide an alternative payment system, but it's not solely focused on reducing dependence on the US dollar.  The goal is to improve financial inclusion and transaction efficiency. Statement 3 is incorrect; the CSA aims to help the Maldives manage its foreign exchange reserves and enhance financial stability.  It's not directly tied to boosting the tourism sector, though a stable economy indirectly benefits the tourism industry.  The relationship between India and the Maldives has evolved, and understanding its complexities requires an in-depth look at the various agreements and initiatives.


**6. With reference to India-Singapore relations, consider the following statements:**

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect.  Statement 1 is false; while Singapore is a significant trading partner, India's largest trading partners are much larger economies. Statement 2 is incorrect; India has a trade deficit with Singapore under CECA, not a surplus.  Statement 3 is incorrect; Project Nexus aims to facilitate fast and efficient cross-border payments by connecting domestic Fast Payment Systems (FPSs), not primarily cybersecurity.  The relationship between India and Singapore is multifaceted, involving various areas of cooperation, including trade, defense, and technology. A thorough understanding of these aspects is required to accurately assess the statements.

(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None


**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All three statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is false; the MGC involves India and five other ASEAN countries: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. Statement 2 is incorrect; while various aspects of cooperation exist, the partnership is broader than just agricultural cooperation.  It encompasses defense, security, and economic ties.  Statement 3 is misleading; while enhancing naval capabilities is a factor, the gift of the INS Kirpan also strengthens bilateral defense ties and signifies a broader strategic partnership.  India and Vietnam's relationship is built on various levels of cooperation, making it crucial to understand the multifaceted nature of their partnership.


**8.  With reference to India-Malaysia relations, consider the following statements:**

1. Malaysia is India's largest trading partner in ASEAN.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is incorrect; while Malaysia is a significant trading partner, it is not India's largest in ASEAN.  Statement 2 is false; CECA aims to reduce, but not eliminate, trade barriers.  Statement 3 is incorrect; the IBCA focuses on conservation efforts for big cats, not primarily on tourism. The India-Malaysia relationship is characterized by diverse forms of cooperation, making it essential to have an understanding of the nuances of their engagement.  It is important to note the specific details of trade agreements and conservation initiatives.

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (b)

**Explanation:**

Only statement 2 is correct. Statement 1 is incorrect; RELOS enables access to logistics and support facilities, but it does not grant unlimited access to military bases. There are limitations and conditions governing the access. Statement 3 is incorrect; while Russia is a major partner, other countries are also involved in the BrahMos project.  The India-Russia relationship is extensive, covering various areas, including military cooperation, energy, and technology.  Specific knowledge of defense agreements and energy dynamics is required for accurate assessment.


**10. With reference to India-US relations, consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 only
(b) 2 only
(c) 3 only
(d) None

**Correct Answer:** (d)

**Explanation:**

All statements are incorrect. Statement 1 is incorrect; SOSA aims to secure timely provision of goods and services, but it does not guarantee an uninterrupted supply under all circumstances.  Unforeseen events can still impact supply. Statement 2 is incorrect; while cybersecurity is important, SOSA is broader in scope, encompassing the mutual timely provision of defence-related goods and services. Statement 3 is incorrect; SOSA is a focused agreement addressing specific aspects of supply chain security, not a comprehensive agreement encompassing all areas of defence cooperation.  The India-US relationship involves a wide spectrum of defense cooperation, requiring a detailed understanding of specific agreements.


Here are some UPSC-style Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) based on the provided target content, adhering to all specified instructions.  Note that due to the nature of the source material, some questions might focus more on geopolitical relations and international organizations than purely economic themes.  However, the economic aspects are interwoven within these relationships.


**1. With reference to the BRICS Cross-Border Payments Initiative (BCBPI), consider the following statements:**

Which of the statements given above is/are correct?
(a) 1 and 2 only
(b) 1 only
(c) 2 and 3 only
(d) 1, 2, and 3

**Correct Answer:** (a)

**Explanation:**

BCBPI, or BRICS Pay, is indeed intended to streamline cross-border payments within the BRICS group, making them quicker and more cost-effective than existing systems. The use of blockchain technology is a core component, improving security and allowing for greater transparency in transactions. However, it's crucial to note that BCBPI is not designed to entirely replace SWIFT. It aims to provide an alternative, particularly for transactions within the BRICS framework.  SWIFT remains a significant global player, and BCBPI's scope is currently limited to the BRICS nations.  Option (c) and (d) are incorrect because they overstate the initiative's ambition. Option (b) is partially correct, but it fails to acknowledge the crucial role of blockchain technology.

Only statement 2 is entirely correct. The FIU-IND was indeed established in 2004. Statement 1 is partially incorrect because while the MER does assess India's measures against money laundering, terrorist financing, and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the statement's claim of a five-year update cycle is not necessarily accurate; the frequency of updates may vary. Statement 3 is incorrect because India uses multiple legislative frameworks to address money laundering, the PMLA being a significant one but not the *sole* framework.  The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA), 1967, also plays a crucial role. The UPSC frequently tests knowledge of India's legislative and institutional frameworks for combating financial crimes.
